      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/10/04/apaurusheya-shrutialien-hour/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was awake today at an hour when I am normally never awake. I had to see off a friend at a time that aint’t normal to me these days. Then I learn to my horror that some womenly emotions have not been adequately addressed. I was under the impression that e-mails always reached their targets, but then that is apparently not the case… The thoughts are still wandering away creating the hopeful scenarios regarding the success of the damage control effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Divergence-cause</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;why do different shakhas have different content even in samhitas? i can understand if they differ in brahmanas aranyakas etc but shouldnt the core once fixed be immutable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; Finally, the second question of why are saMhitA-s divergent: Anyone who understands molecular evolution will see this as entirely unsurprising. The original vaidika tradition was entirely oral; even the early switches to writing affected only some like kANva. Unlike certain white indologists, we hold that at the time of the shAkhA divergence, the people still spoke the accented register of the language, not classical Skt, leave alone a vulgar prAkR^ita as those indologists would have it. Hence, when an oral text is transmitted there would be the usual phenomenon of mutation: insertions, deletions, substitutions by homophonic or homosemic words. There will also be incomplete sorting &amp;amp; incorporation of family traditions that went into saMhitA collections. So there was divergence from all this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Grains</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the R^igveda there are, at best 3 ambiguous references to rice. The word is odana &amp;ndash; while today it is taken to mean rice, it could simply be a porridge which could have been made from another grain. The primary grain in the RV is yava &amp;ndash; barley &amp;amp; there&amp;rsquo;s no millet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the late YV period rice becomes dominant. In the archaeological record, we see that rice rose to dominance along with lentils in the post-urban Harappan lands where the Arya-s had settled. Thus, the rise of rice is keeping with the Aryan settlement in India. In the same time millets also started rising in cultivation, though not to the level of rice. Thus, we see occasional mentions of millets in through the late YV traditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They go back to at least the common Indo-Iranian period on the high steppes. While they are found in the RV: e.g. namo dive bR^ihate rodasIbhyAm mitrAya vochaM varuNAya mILhuShe sumR^iLIkAya mILhuShe | they are rather rare in that text &amp;amp; the count of 19 is liberal including cases like: namovR^idhair avasyubhiH sute raNa || One observes that their count dramatically increases in the yajuSh text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Atharva</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/meta/articles/MT/on_atharva/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The AV is internally mentioned several times in the yajuSh as atharvA&lt;del&gt;Ngirasa. Thus, the collection predates the tathAgata, even if you follow a white indological chronology. The tathAgata, as is typical of him, redefined what the trayi meant; hence, we cannot take his mention of the term as defining some kind of vaidika reality. As you know he also clashes with a skull-tapping AV v1, va&lt;/del&gt;NgIsha.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bipartition&#34;&gt;Bipartition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Atharvaveda seems to have been compiled in two parts: The atharvan collection &amp;amp; aṅgiras collection. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Periods</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In discussion of the history of the Indo-Aryans a common problem is periodization. When you want to periodize, you have to ask yourself how many cuts are most appropriate for a reasonable representation of the developments that took place. The 3-cut formula Early, Middle, Late is is easy to express &amp;amp; widely used for many kinds of periodization but you have to ask yourself if it is appropriate when applied to the corpus that is termed &amp;ldquo;Vedic&amp;rdquo; in philological sense. Also is the genre termed &amp;ldquo;Vedic&amp;rdquo; temporally exclusive of other corpora like &amp;ldquo;itihAsa&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;purANa&amp;rdquo;, darshaNa-shAstra, dharma-shAstra, Ayurveda, jyotiSha etc. Thus, when people are referring Vedic texts we don&amp;rsquo;t see a standard usage of the periodization though instinctively people understand the relative ages unless you are of the literal apauruSheya belief. I would posit that minimally you need at least 5 cuts for the Vedic corpus v.v. approximately:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;rayividyA&amp;gt; tevijja should be correctly understood both in the pALi &amp;amp; early Skt contexts as the 3 types of mantra-s: R^ik-s, sAman-s, yajuSh-es.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The RV saMhitA is only 1st type;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the SV saMhitA is 2nd; SV brAhmaNa-s have all 3 types; e.g., pa~nchaviMsha-brAhmaNa opens with the yajuSh-es of the taNDin-s.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The YV saMhitA-s have both R^ik-s&amp;amp; yajuSh-es. The YV-s have parishiShTha-s with RV style R^ik collections for hautra roles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AV is a collection of RV-style R^ik-s; yajuSh-es &amp;amp; a special class of incantation most commonly of the bheShaja type. These types have clear Iranic cognates &amp;ndash; yasna haptangaiti is Iranic yajuSh.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the 3 types of mantra-s &amp;ndash; the trayi &amp;ndash; likely had a deep presence in the Aryan tradition &amp;amp; was only partially aligned to the saMhitA collections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
