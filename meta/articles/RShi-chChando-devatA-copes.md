> Interesting that a ṛgveda gṛhyasūtra mentions ayātayāmatā as one of the desired fruits of upākarmā - a sāmaveda-brāhmaṇa-vākya says yātayāmatā comes when the mantras are applied without ṛṣi-chandas-devatā.

The kANDaRishi phenomenon is indeed a cope from KYV side. And AV copes even harder - majority of Rishis are atharva (even if you can find the same in RV with different Rishi) and an explosion of peculiar Chandas even for mantras that obviously are yajur. Even RV copes to some extent by making rivers, stones etc. as Rishis for some suktas.

Shows how seriously various shAkhAs took to the importance of "knowing Rishi Chandas Devata", despite losing that info long back or plain impossibility for yajur.
