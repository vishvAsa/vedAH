      <description>&lt;p&gt;Becoming “Modern”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Children born in the United States 1982–2002, the period bracketing  the turn of the millennium, are known as Millennials, as those born in the  decade after World War II, 1945–55, were dubbed Baby Boomers. Seeking labels  for the generations of Andhra pandits discussed here we might call the old&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;est set Traditionalists, a group that included Baballa, Lanka, Duvvuri Yajulu,  Bulusu Cayanalu, and Gullapalli Sita Ram Sastri, as well as Renducintala  Venkatacalu Yajulu, Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra Sastri, and others. They  had all grown up with what Chinese culture esteems as filial piety, particularly  with regard to the father-son relationship, which in Vedic Brahmanical terms  usually means guru-student. For them there was strict adherence to the rules  for sandhya-vandana, adhyaya, marriage and other rites of passage, yajna, and  subsequent sacrifices when they chose to perform them. With few exceptions,  parental will and authority were obeyed without question. Baballa, one of six  ahitagni brothers, is an example of generational fidelity to the path of his ahi tagni father and his father’s ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
