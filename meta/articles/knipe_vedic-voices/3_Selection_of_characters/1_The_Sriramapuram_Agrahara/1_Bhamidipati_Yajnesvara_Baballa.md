3.1.1.1 An Extraordinary Lineage 

Like others in the agrahara, this was a household that kept no small pets, no  cats, no dogs, only bovines. Therefore, when the kurma (tortoise) came to play

a role in a great srauta ritual, and stayed in the house for some days while  all the preparations were underway, he—or perhaps she, no one was sure— became the target of everyone’s affection. Baballa, sacrificer-to-be, found him  irresistible and admired him daily. “For the ritual of placement we dug a hole,  lined it with shells, let some honey drip onto his shell and placed him looking  at the hole. Face to face with him I recited: ‘You are not required here, you are  free to go.’ The altar bricks for the aruna-ketuka were laid in place above him.  Next morning he was gone. He found the way out.” 

Bhamidipati Yajnesvara Somayaji, Srivatsa gotra, whose affectionate sobri quet “Baballa” is known all along coastal Andhra, is a good selection to begin this  survey of recent and contemporary Veda pandits. Born in 1903, his life stretched  across all but ten years of the twentieth century. And it was on the arugu, the  open-air front steps of his house that most interviews in Sriramapuram were  held, even for years after his death a few months short of his ninetieth birth day. His lineage was one of the most ahitagni-prolific families in nineteenth and twentieth-century India. Baballa traced his ancestry back to the eighteenth  century and the mula-purusa, root ancestor, Bhamidipati Brahmibuta Acarya.  Brahmibuta became a samnyasin, a renouncer-ascetic, but not before pro ducing a lineage that would become extraordinarily famous by any stan dard: Virabhadra Somayaji, Acchuta Rama Somayajulu, Yajnesvara Somayajulu,  Chinna Subrahmanya Somayajulu, in that order of paternal ancestors, the last  being Baballa’s father. Baballa’s mother was Kamesvara of the Akella Veda pan dit family. This fifth-generation union created a sixth generation, six sons who  all became ahitagni. Five became soma sacrificers, including Baballa, and the  sixth very nearly joined them but died when his agni-stoma was in its planning  stages. In the last few centuries, few if any families in India or Nepal have ever  had six brothers performing agni-hotra at one time. 

Baballa’s astonishing lineage crashed abruptly when his only son,  Subrahmanya Somayaji, with the nickname “Bullebbayi,” suffered multiple  congenital ailments and could not become an eligible Veda pandit. Neighbors,  softly describing his disabilities, including lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis,  a painful disase that also infected his mother, Sundari), called him “some 

what innocent.” A  further blow was the death of his only daughter at the  age of twenty days, a sad event never mentioned by Baballa. Bullebbayi had  two sons—one, Somasekhara, given away in adoption to Baballa’s younger  brother; the other, Yajnesvara Prasad, producing three beautiful daughters but  no son. The three girls are today the ninth generation of direct descendants of  Brahmibuta, the eighteenth-century samnyasin. 

Yajnesvara Prasad, a schoolteacher, and his wife Laksmi continue to live in  the house at the head of the lane that has always been recognized as principal

Table 3.1. Eight generations of Bhamidipati genealogy

residence of the agrahara, the one that welcomes visitors. Table 3.1 is a simpli fied sketch of the Bhamidipati genealogy. All of these names are here pared  down to essentials. For example, the full name of his grandson, born in 1961,  that Baballa recited was Yajnesvara Venkata Satya Surya Rama Subrahmanya  Somayaji. His was the seventh generation in a row to carry the hopeful hon orific Soma-yaji, soma-sacrificer, and the second in succession to have that  acclimation unrealized. It might be noted here that in marriages to boys who  eventually become soma sacrificers, girls are known by personal names only  until marriage. After that life-changing event no personal or family name is a  

referent, only the female equivalent of Soma-yaji, Somi-devamma. Although born in Mukkamala, Baballa was raised in the nearby village of  Irusumanda in the home of his maternal uncle, Akella Subha Avadhani, father  of Sundari, Baballa’s future bride, six years his junior. As youngsters they both  attended the school in Irusumanda, Baballa to fourth class, when he could  read and write Telugu by the age of nine, and Sundari to third class. When  Sundari was twelve and Baballa eighteen, their five-day wedding took place as  a menarika (cross-cousin) marriage, one that lasted for seventy-one years. They  lived first in Mukkamala, then in Sriramapuram. 

Baballa’s father, famous for teaching many students, was guru not only  for Baballa and his five brothers but also for the second Sriramapuram ahi tagni featured in this survey, Duvvuri Yajulu. At that time there were as many  

[[60]]

as twenty local students of Veda pandits in Mukkamala, with others arriving  from surrounding villages, some by sailboats gliding silently along the river  channels, or smaller craft poled through canals, or punt ferries pulled by rope  to connect one dirt track with another. Before there were metalled all-weather  roads and eventual bus services it was faster to travel by water, usually with  no more cost than hitching a ride on a bullock cart or horse tonga. Duvvuri  Yajulu, arriving from Kapilesvarapuram, remembered Baballa’s father being  so deeply lost in reciting the Vedic text of the day that “we students would  sneak away on calls of nature and he never noticed we were gone!” 

Once he had completed the eighty-two pannas, Baballa’s energies went  into three enterprises:  supervision of those crop fields in Gangalakurru he  was eventually to inherit, the teaching of Veda to selected students, and con tinuous browsing into texts beyond the Taittiriya sakha he had mastered. His  quest for knowledge was a lifelong pursuit, in Veda, srauta, Dharma-sastra,  Mimamsa, Vedanta, Jyotisa, Vyakarana, and other genres. His hunger for the  association of ideas never diminished. After our first unannounced encounter  in October 1980, when he had been surprised at noon in the midst of textual  studies, he said with genuine excitement and a sparkle in his eyes, “I was  looking into exactly these subjects you suddenly came to inquire about!” He  allowed that initial visit to blossom into an auspiciously destined event. For  the second visit the greeting was as warm as for old and dear friends. Even  in his latest years, with each visit an almost completely deaf Baballa would be  discovered squinting at a book or palm-leaf manuscript held only inches from  his glasses. And never did he lose his impish sense of humor. 

Baballa thanked his father for providing him a life free from economic  worries. “We were very fond of each other. He was a strict disciplinarian,  tough on me. But he took care of everything, made sure I could give undivided  attention to learning. I enjoyed that luxury and remember a youth as comfort 

able as swinging in a cradle.” As to teaching, Baballa took on fewer students  than his father but was known for dedication to those he accepted. At the  height of his textual reciting career he had four students living in his house  continuously learning Veda. He was the exclusive guru for grandson Prasad  who learned all eighty-two panna from him during 1971 to 1980. Although  he did not appear for his examination by the Parishad, Prasad, who became  a schoolteacher in a nearby village in 1986, remembers going to the fields  every day in his grandfather’s footsteps, accompanied by one or another fel low student—Chirravuri Ramam, Sripada Manikya, Prabhala Krishnamurti,  Samavedam Narayana (discussed later), and others who became Veda pandits  well known throughout Konasima and other parts of Andhra. They would sit  beside the rice paddy or under coconut palms for adhyaya and Baballa would

take breaks from time to time to check on the field hands. Then they would  return to the village for lunch and a review of the morning recitation. Baballa  remained a hands-on “gentleman farmer” all his life until finally turning over  supervision of the fields to Prasad at the close of the 1990s. 

3.1.1.2 Examining Students 

Perhaps it was the strict standards required by Baballa that intimidated his  grandson-student and made Prasad nervous about appearing before the  Parishad examiners. In the 1950s Baballa and his Veda pandit colleagues raised  donations and established a trust fund to conduct an examination system for  various genres of Vedic and Sanskrit learning, including Veda and srauta, first  and foremost, but also smarta, apara, Agamas, Mimamsa, Vyakarana, and  other subjects, with assemblies convened in Amalapuram, Rajahmundry, or  various East Godavari District villages every year. In Vaisakha month 1987, for  example, the village of Vyaghresvaram volunteered to be host and examina tions were held for thirty students in Veda, four in smarta, and one in Agama,  each of them assessed after eight to twelve years of study. Examinations in  different texts and recitation patterns took place over a period of two days with  the afternoon of the second day spent honoring successful students and estab 

lished scholars. “For encouragement” each student who passed was given  between Rs. 150 and 200 (about $3.75 to $5). 

3.1.1.3 Fulfillment in Srauta 

Baballa was well into his middle age, after many years’ study of srauta and  reflection on the family heritage with its multiple generations of ahitagni,  before he seriously considered setting the fires. Nudges came from numerous  colleagues and relatives. “As well as one’s own commitment,” he noted, “one  needs confirmation from professional colleagues and the moral support of  outsiders. Until I was openly prodded I did not have the courage to do it.” He  performed adhana, a ritual establishment of the three fires for daily agni-hotra,  in 1959 at the age of fifty-five. Six months later came his agni-stoma, first soma sacrifice, known throughout Konasima as yajna. Lanka Venkatarama Sastri,  his friend and highly respected Veda pandit neighbor a half hour’s walk away  in Nedunuru, was adhvaryu, executive priest. Lanka was himself preparing for  his own agni-stoma. 

Baballa’s yajna initiated an intense period of srauta and other rituals that  was to last five years, as if the sheer weight of his lineage had suddenly ener gized him. “I wanted to accomplish without fail all the rituals performed by all  my ancestors.” After agni-stoma came the sravana pasu animal sacrifice in the 

[[62]]

month of Sravana. In Bhadrapada month 1960 he performed aruna-ketuka,  the construction of a fire altar composed of symbolic “bricks” in the form of  water offerings. This sacrifice with his pet tortoise he always described as his  favorite and one that both his father and father’s older brother had done. For  this he did madhu-kara for twelve days, a symbolic year of begging for food  from house to house as if he had been returned to his youthful brahmacarin days. The catur-masya, four-monthly sacrifices, were also fulfilled, as was the  ritual of the new rice harvest, the agrayana, a performance that Baballa and  Sundari were to manage in Phalguna month every year through 1990 when  he was eighty-seven and she was eighty-one. In 1991, when both were frail and  quite deaf, it was regretfully omitted from their ritual schedule for the first  time. By then it had been the pattern for some years to allow the agni-hotra fires to lapse and then be rekindled for twice-daily offerings and two lunar isti 

bracketing the agrayana, a procedure detailed in Chapter 6. It is not surprising that Baballa also embarked upon lengthy rituals known  as naksatra or pavitra offerings (isti). Throughout Andhra, people suffering  misfortunes have recourse to temples housing shrines of the nava-graha, the  nine planets. If Sani (Saturn), for example, appears in a horoscope, his temple  in Mandapalli, within walking distance of Sriramapuram, is the place for most  people—Hindus, Muslims, and Christians included—to transfer Sani’s dosa, evil effect, onto a Siva linga or onto a special Brahman ritualist who has the  temerity to unload it from himself. Baballa did not go to Mandapalli or wor ship nava-graha elsewhere. Vaidika Brahmans have older, and in their eyes  more powerful, resources in offerings to twenty-eight naksatra, constellations  or “star markers.” The naksatra isti, some forty days in duration, was among  other substantial rituals accomplished by Baballa in that energetic period in  Mukkamala before and after 1960. 

His colorful descriptions of details brought them to life. “The yajamana must not touch the bricks of the cayana without first undergoing diksa.  Otherwise he will be burned by Agni like an electrician touching a hot wire  without gloves.” And with regard to his agni-stoma: “Putting soma into the fire  makes one a soma-yaji, and then one travels in a well-grooved path, like a cart  moving easily along a track, not like one on an untrodden field.” 

3.1.1.4 The Move to Sriramapuram 

In 1962 Baballa and Sundari were granted a small plot in Sriramapuram across  the Billakurru Canal and westward a few hundred yards, almost within hail ing distance of the old house. They spent their entire lives within sight of this  stream that Baballa, a believer in the Sapta-Godavari mental map, endowed 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 63 

with the name Kausika, that is, the great rsi Visvamitra. The donation included  money to build a house with an agni-hotra room and an acre of cropland with  an assured yield of fifteen bags of paddy, unhusked rice. Because of their  reputation as open-armed host and hostess for ahitagni and other Veda pan 

dits, they were given the roadside plot facing the lane, the better to welcome  guests immediately on arrival. Since ahitagni may safely take food and drink  only from the kitchen of the wife of another ahitagni, their house became the  natural stopover for those participating in sabha (assemblies) in Mukkamala,  Sriramapuram, or sometimes Vyaghresvaram.1 

As mentioned in Chapter 2, the Tirupati-Tirumalai Devasthanam (TTD),  the administrative body of the famous temple of Venkatesvara, in coopera tion with the Department of Religious Endowments of the state government  of Andhra Pradesh, made a major commitment to underwrite Veda teach ing, srauta ritual, and a heightened public awareness of Vedic tradition. Their  projects transformed the lives of Veda pandits in much of South India. With  enormous wealth and extensive power in India not unlike that of the Vatican  in Rome, the TTD distributes to Veda pandits monthly stipends, pensions,  and honoraria and employs them for daily parayana (recitation) in temples,  not to be heard and repeated by students, but rather to be heard formally by  honored resident deities and informally by worshippers passing through. This  belongs, of course, to a modern tradition in which public hearing of the sacro sanct Veda became open to the non-twice-born communities. 

When invited repeatedly by the TTD to take on a parayana position, or at  least accept an honorarium, Baballa bellowed his response: “Not for ahitagni!”  To take remuneration of any kind, he argued, would be veda-vikraya, the sell ing of the Veda, an atrocious sin. He was aparigraha, not taking honoraria,  dana, gifts. But the TTD enrolled him in its pension plan anyway and also  extended its largesse to his unemployable son. Baballa’s fierce independence  regarding things monetary extended to the interview situation as well, for  which he would never accept an honorarium. If a traditional silk or wool shawl  was presented to him he would laugh aloud and say “Oh, this must be for (the  god) Dattatreya!” and give it to someone else. 

Perhaps more than any other Veda pandit Baballa expressed affection for  the local people and an awareness of their beliefs. At one time, out of interest  in the fourteenth-century Advaita scholar, Vidyaranya, author of the Pancadasi  and other works in the school of Sankara, he thought of establishing a shrine  by the bathing platform on the Kausika, just across the road from his house,  accessible to all for japa but not inside the agrahara. Then he became aware  that not many knew about Vidyaranya. On the other hand, Dattatreya, son  of the great rsi Atri, was quite popular. Baballa did not give credence to local 

[[64]]

folklore that a living incarnation of Dattatreya resided not far away in the  Sripada family, but he thought the original god, the amalgamation of Brahma,  Visnu, and Siva, deserved a home near the agrahara. “All three will be here and  people belonging to any of them can worship together.” When it was pointed  out that Dattatreya is not a Vedic god he broke into his one-tooth grin, “Ah,  yes, but Visnu is in the garhapatya, Siva in the daksinagni, and Brahma in the  ahavaniya,” knowing full well that the local folk knew nothing of these terms  and had never seen his agni-hotra room. A  donor was located and in 1987  the little Dattatreya shrine was founded with mantras and homa into a newly  rope-churned fire. Baballa also wished to acquire land in order to plant aus picious trees, the marri, medi, ravi, and vepa, in particular, so that folk in the  region could come and worship them and thereby acquire boons. 

Baballa was a special person, an independent rustic, witty, good-humored,  and earthy. He was always modest, fair-minded, not at all intimidating or  threatening yet clearly most senior of the local pandits, even when nearly stone  deaf. In America he would be known as a cracker-barrel philosopher, a source  of down-home wisdom laced with wisecracks and folklore. A senior colleague  described him as a maha-purusa (great human) who always replied from  knowledge and experience and never hesitated to respond to a query: “Anyone  who came to him, young or old, Brahman or Pancama (Scheduled Caste),  received his blessing. In my long experience he was always there for others,  never self-preoccupied.” 

Visits to Sriramapuram were occasions for the Veda pandits to gather on  Baballa’s arugu, sometimes even interrupting teaching sessions. They quickly  became mini-sabha of vigorous debate on every conceivable subject, Baballa  acting as moderator-sage, providing balance and well-rounded discussion,  pulling others back from confrontational remarks or the occasional wild the 

ory. For example, disparaging comments on Scheduled Caste encroachment  or Christian baptisms in the sacred river would be truncated by Baballa as  senior scholar: “Hmm, yes, I know about that, but . . .” and the original topic  would come back into focus. Baballa was ahead of his time in accomodating  cheerfully to the new multiculturalism of Indian society and he had a knack  for countering discrimination with softly stated reason and tolerance. 

In the eyes of the visitor from abroad Baballa was a precious and invalu able link to an age that has virtually disappeared. It was not only that he spoke  from the old chronology (“I was born in the year krodhi on the fourth of the  bright half of Margasirsa-masa and I was married in the year dundubhi in the  bright half of Jyestha-masa  .  .  .”). It was his stubborn resistance to certain  changes that allowed him to perpetuate a measure of the nineteenth-century  traditionalism of his father and other gurus. Stolidly ensconced in the ritual 

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 65 

and dharma of the old school, he was less amenable than others to accom modate to some modern ways. At the same time, his mulishness extended to  certain normative srauta procedures. For one, he steadfastly refused priestly  roles in the srauta rituals of others. Only once did he deviate from that vow  and that was in reciprocity for his own earlier yajna conducted by Lanka. In  Lanka’s agni-stoma he accepted the minor sadasya role, the seventeenth priest  who assists the brahman. 

Several justifications were offered regarding his refusals to participate as a  ritualist. First, he was guided by his aparigraha stance of “non-acceptance” of  gratuities for anything connected with Veda. Just as he never accepted daksina from a student for adhyapana so he could not acquire the cash daksina a rtvij necessarily receives from the sacrificer in order to complete the ritual. Both  would be, as Baballa construed it, Veda for sale. Accepting a donation of land  and house was one thing, money for reciting Veda or performing srauta quite  another. 

But also he refused rtvij roles because of specific apprehensions, the  dreaded negative consequences from performing alongside inadequately  trained younger colleagues. Like many senior Veda pandits he was alarmed  at lapses in traditional teaching methods, relaxed examination standards, and  innovations such as the use of printed books for students to review by reading  what had been learned guru-mukha, from the mouth of the guru. He feared  imprecision in the kriya (ritual acts) employing mantras imperfectly interior 

ized, since the results of those kriya could inflict personal as well as cosmic  damage. Therefore he was reluctant to join a company of rtvij whose training,  credentials, and moral integrity were not entirely known to him. On several  occasions he spoke about the dangers of soma-bhaksana, drinking soma, in the  company of unfamiliar pandits. Times had changed since his childhood when  the accomplished Bhamidipati family alone could supply the eighteen rtvij necessary for an agni-stoma, if not all seventy-two for a sarvato-mukha. 

In part, Baballa’s disavowal was simple concern over the recent lack of  obeisance to patterns of the old school. “What kind of Brahman is he whose  upanayana was completed in one hour (instead of the traditional four or five  days)?” he would inquire of the long shadow of a coconut palm. But perhaps  more important was the thought of dark consequences born out of experience  and the instruction of elders such as his ahitagni guru Bulusu Somayajulu.  “Just as a person who does not know precisely how to perform abhicara (the  use of mantras in spells) can be killed by it, so the consequences can be  extremely dangerous from improper sacrifice of animals. Animal sacrifice is  not the simple matter its critics and the common people say.”66 vedic voices 

The awe with which he regarded “ritually precarious situations,” his phrase  for the pasu-bandha, was matched on a different track by mystical experiences  during agni-hotra. Just as he was one of the few to speak casually and without  affectation of the hazardous practices of abhicara, so was Baballa a rare win 

dow into the transformative spiritual side of a ritual life. In choppy, emotion ally charged phrases, hands gesturing to animate the inexpressible, he would  at times confide details of certain wondrous moments of great impact. “One  day while performing agni-hotra something very special happened, something  luminous, with brilliance (tejassu), arose from the homa and appeared before  my eyes. Then my daughter-in-law conceived and was blessed with a male  child.” At another time while offering into the ahavaniya fire “a four-armed  figure (catur-bujudu) appeared. Why? I tried to imagine! Well, a second grand son was on the way!” 

3.1.1.5 A Funeral to Remember 

These emotional revelations out of mystical contexts of Agni, his refusal of dak sina as guru, rtvij, or TTD “employee,” his fear of drinking soma in the wrong  company, all mark Baballa a member of an older stratum of the Vaidika elite  that is scarcely present today. “After Baballa,” said Samavedam, his next-door  neighbor for over three decades, “there is no other.” Baballa broke his hip in  a fall June 1, 1993, and lay dying on darbha grass on a cot, another cot nearby  holding his only son dying of cancer. Baballa, fully conscious, longed for his  antyesti, the “last sacrifice” of his body to be first so that Bullebbayi could per 

form sraddha to advance him into a proper and orderly rebirth after a sojourn  with his father and earlier ancestors. He received his wish and died at 10 am on August 6, less than six months before the death of his sixty-four-year-old  son on New Year’s Day 1994. 

Being an ahitagni, the brahma-medha funeral was requisite, a special  three-hour cremation via the three agni-hotra fires along with all ritual imple ments save those used in re-burning the pulverized bones in another spe cial rite for soma sacrificers, the punar-dahana. Both of these funeral rites are  described at the end of Chapter 6, along with losta-citi, a replication of the  agni-cayana fire altar on the spot of cremeation. For some younger members  of Vedic families living in Sriramapuram, Nedunuru, and Vyaghresvaram,  this was the first brahma-medha they had witnessed, but later in the same  decade more were to follow as local ahitagni couples were reduced: Duvvuri  Yajulu’s wife, Surya, and Pullela’s wife, Kamesvari, in 1996, Bulusu Cayanulu  in 1997, Lanka in 1999.

A Selection of Ahitagni and Other Veda Pandits 67 

The day of death and beginning of asauca, ritual impurity, are reckoned  not from the moment of biological death of an ahitagni, but rather from the  occurrence of brahma-medha and ultimate interiorization of Agni. Baballa  requested from his deathbed that nothing be done with his body until the  arrival of Ramam, who was at that time teaching in Pune, Maharashtra. After  a telegram reached him it took Ramam a day and a half on the train to reach  Rajahmundry, with a taxi down to Sriramapuram. For those steamy August  days, Baballa’s long frail body lay stretched across blocks of ice just outside his  agni-hotra room, a body, ritually and legally speaking, not yet dead. 

Ramam and the others immediately took out Baballa’s arani kindling  sticks and recreated fire in the garhapatya and then transferred embers to the  ahavaniya and daksinagni until the final time when fires burned in all three  hearths. A final isti in the house was completed and prayascitta, expiatory ritu 

als as recompense for agni-hotra, isti, and an agrayana that could not be per formed in the last days of Baballa’s and Sundari’s incapacitation. Embers from  each hearth were then dropped into kunda, terra-cotta pots slung from cords,  each marked “g,” “a” or “d” in Telugu letters. A fourth pot was marked for the  aupasana household fire. These were carried in front of the body out the door  and down the path by the terminally ill son, Bullebayi, who required support to  walk, as did the quite feeble widow, Sundari. Grandson Prasad was that crutch  for both until he had to turn back at the polimera, the sacred boundary. His own  father, Bullebayi, was still living and he, Prasad, could therefore not participate  in Baballa’s funeral. Embers from Baballa’s three hearths were now transferred  a final time onto his body, the ahavaniya offering fire beside his head, the dak 

sinagni beside his chest, the garha-patya cooking fire by his right thigh, each  igniting straw that then set wood alight. Within three hours Baballa’s body was  no more, his agni-hotra fires having burned together and conjoined as Agni. 

Brahma-medha, punar-dahana, and lost-aciti are rarely performed rituals  beyond the expertise of local apara Brahmans who supervise the last rites of  laukika Brahmans and non-Brahmans. Even if they knew or had access to the  texts, however, it is considered risky to call them into service because of their  unclean status. For Baballa, an apara Brahman of good reputation, Akondi  Suryanarayana, was brought from Amalapuram to conduct the normal rituals  from cremation through the twelfth day. On the thirteenth day, however, the  bone collection (asthi-samcayana), special re-cremation (punar-dahana), and  layout of a losta-citi constructed of blocks of mud bricks (istaka) were in the  hands of Chirravuri Ramam, Baballa’s longtime student and spiritual “son,”  with Duvvuri Yajulu and Bulusu Cayanulu assisting from the Pitr-medha  Sutras. Most of these kriya and mantras, being unfamiliar ones, were directed 

[[68]]

by reading the text, but from time to time well-known mantras would surface  and allow the officiating troupe to relax into customary rhythms. Ashes with  fragments of bones and teeth had been collected a day after cremation and now  a portion was ground on two natural stones found at the cremation ground,  mixed with ghee, and reburned in order to obliterate all traces of soma. 

There was no need to save the remainder of his ashes for the Ganga, said  the elders; his beloved flowing Kausika is where they belong. Back at the house  the ayatana clay fire pits were scraped away two weeks after the sapindi-karana ritual that advanced Baballa’s preta to the status of pitr, ancestor. Baballa’s nec essary monthly rites, masikas, were done by Bullebayi only four times, the last  on the morning he himself died. It was quite difficult to convince Sundari,  Bullebayi’s mother, that her son was gone since she was completely deaf and  her eyesight too feeble to read signs devised for her. She insisted that he was  sleeping. Sundari died in July and daughter-in-law Savitri, in her white wid ow’s garb, became resigned to the sudden absence of two generations from  the well-visited house on the corner of the road.2 

3.1.1.6 The Extended Family 

The house at the head of the lane is still a local resource, one sought out  by folk in need of muhurta and dharma-sandeha responses, the former being  determination from a pancanga astrological manual of the correct “hour” for  a particular ceremony, the latter being answers to “doubts about the law.”  Previously it was Baballa who was the respected authority. Now it is his grand 

son, Yajnesvara Prasad. From his grandfather Prasad learned all eighty-two  panna of Taittiriya until age nineteen, at the same time pursuing studies for  a bachelor of science degree. A bachelor of education degree followed and he  accepted a teaching post close to Sriramapuram. Earlier, in 1978, he had been  married to Laksmi Narasakanta from Palakollu when he was seventeen and she  was twelve. When Laksmi came of age she was welcomed to Sriramapuram  as a lively girl of astonishing beauty, and there was hope of resumed continu 

ity in a Vedic srauta heritage. In a few years she gave birth to three successive  daughters, Rekha, Madhuri, and Kalyani, whose screams and yelps at play  rang down the dusty lane. But there were only daughters, and with the third  came a medical report, tragic for any Hindu but devastating for a Vaidika lin 

eage, that she could bear no more children. The Brahmibuta-Baballa legacy  was closed.

are regarded as “English education,” huna-vidya. Prasad does not speak  English but nevertheless advances the curricula of the foreign occupiers of  India. On the other hand, more palatable to his elders, he serves as secretary  for the Godavari Mandala Veda Parishad in nearby Amalapuram as his con 

tribution to Vaidika society. In his youth he accepted rtvij roles, hotr in local  agrayana, for example, but that was years ago. He still recites, but without real  authority, in a tentative, almost listless voice. Although he has had encourage ment to go further he admits that for him the srauta life of his forbears is an  unlikely prospect. (See Figure 3.3, Yajnesvara Prasad and Laksmi with daugh ters Rekha, Madhuri, and Kalyani, Sriramapuram, 2005.) 

It was Prasad who described many of the subtler aspects of Baballa’s life  since it was his tata-garu, grandfather, rather than his father who was the true  adhi-kara, authority, for his upbringing, and Baballa’s counsel bore something  close to divine imprint in the mind of the youth. Now living in the house con 

structed by Baballa he is daily reminded of his grandfather’s life. Prasad related  that Baballa knew every detail of smarta rituals but never once performed one.  It was Bulusu Cayanulu, another ahitagni in the agrahara, who served as fam ily purohita in a hereditary role going back to Baballa’s great-great-grandfather.

Baballa and Sundari understood the needs of ahitagni who came to the  area for sabha, marriages, and other events, so for more than twenty years  from the 1970s to 1990s they went to Mukkamalla for forty days in Sravana  and Bhadrapada, taking food cooked in Sundari’s kitchen for guests who could  not eat in non-ahitagni houses. And it was Prasad who revealed what Baballa  had said of the scholar from America in those early visits in the 1980s: “He is  one of us,” said Baballa, “and has more interest in Vedic tradition than people  here. For some samsara reason he was destined to be born elsewhere. But he  belongs to our country, our region, our place. To disseminate our tradition he  was born in that faraway country.” 

The extended family might also be said to include Chirravuri Srirama  Sarma, “Ramam,” Baballa’s prize pupil, without whom he said his funeral  should not proceed. Ramam assisted his guru for years with routine isti and  with him studied Veda, Mimamsa, Vyakarana, and Tarka. He was interviewed  when he was visiting Baballa in Sriramapuram and also in his own home  in Rajahmundry while he was teaching Sanskrit courses in the Government  Oriental College. For three years, including the time that Baballa died, he held  a teaching position at Pune University but found scholarly life there not to his  liking. “People in Pune do research and write books of no practical value to  society.” The affection between Baballa and Ramam was palpable and in obvi ous ways the latter was more than the spiritual descendant in the guru-sisya 

relationship; he was the son Baballa did not have. Although Baballa did not  remark on it, Ramam’s decision to enter a laukika career as a Sanskrit rather  than a Veda pandit must have been a painful one. 

Ramam has his own pragmatic agenda for the significance of the Vedas  and will hold forth seated cross-legged on a high square stool for as long as  three hours at a stretch. He is convinced that ancient sciences were central in  the Vedas and somehow through “a break in the sampradaya” this knowledge  was lost. “We must recover that wisdom and experiment with it.” He shares  with some Native American Indians a belief that all the mineral, herbal, and  animal resources of the planet are sufficient to solve global problems if only  humans recognize and coordinate them. Passionately he wishes to establish  a “Center for Research in the Sciences of Ancient India” to mine the Vedas  for cures of disease and other misfortunes—leprosy, leukoderma, deafness  (“cured with application of seven types of earth, including clay from an ant hill”), snakebite (“for a cure one needs first to know if it is a Brahman, Ksatriya,  Vaisya, or Sudra snake”), fever, heart disease, tuberculosis (“derived from con 

tact with women”), gray hair, wayward satellites in space, and on and on. At the  time of the Bhopal Union Carbide disaster he reported that eyesight damaged  by poison gases had been restored when Veda pandits recited mantras while

pouring ghee into a sacrificial fire. Aside from these views, eccentric even to  many within the tradition, Ramam has taught at least one son and thereby  provided a measure of continuity from the mouth of guru Baballa into the  future. 

The loss of Baballa had a profound effect on the four remaining ahitagni in  the Sriramapuram, Nedunuru, Vyaghresvaram circle as they recognized their  own advanced years and the lack of replacements in succeeding generations.  Only one of the four had a son who might some day qualify to set the fires.  There was much discussion of Baballa’s sagacity, quick wit, and remarkable  ability to see through ephemera to the reality at hand. Once as he passed by  when the dora was interviewing Duvvuri Yajulu he remarked affably “What’s  happening?” “Oh, nothing much,” replied Yajulu, “just discussing the texts.”  In mock horror Baballa immediately retorted, “What do you mean just the  texts! You are the text!”
