title = "2 Pullela Laksminarayana (1920–1999)"

+++

The third ahitagni who established fires in Vyaghresvaram village in the  1960s was Pullela Laksminarayana, Kaundinya gotra, born in 1920 in  Narendrapuram on the Gannavaram Canal beside the Vasistha Godavari  River. As a new agni-stomin about 1970 at the age of fifty, his full name  became Pullela Laksminarayana Soma-yajulu and his wife became Kamesvari  Somi-devamma. He was the only son of an ahitagni. Sripada Laksmi Narasimha  Soma-yaji, a maternal uncle in Tondavaram, was another strong motivator for  Laksminarayana’s srauta career. 

Kamesvari (1926–96), from the Vemparala family, was the granddaugh ter of an ahitagni in the same village of Tondavaram, south of Gangalakurru.  She was married to Laksminarayana there on the left bank of the great  horseshoe curve of the Vainateya Godavari River in 1936 when she was ten  and he was sixteen. They raised eight children, four boys and four girls.  None of the girls married Veda pandits and as was the case with the two  Bulusu brothers of Vyaghresvaram, none of the sons learned Veda. The sons  of Laksminarayana and Kamesvari, now beyond their middle years, blame  economic hardship for this but also, perhaps defensively, mention a certain  shyness in their father with regard to authoritative teaching. Following his  ahitagni father, Laksminarayana had wished to set the fires but delayed until  a private house could be obtained. About 1962 he and his family moved  east a few miles to Vyaghresvaram in search of a better livelihood, aided  by the provision of a house from Kamesvari’s older sister. Vyaghresvaram  in the 1960s, like the adjacent villages of Mukkamala, Nedunuru, and the  Sriramapuram agrahara, was a lively scene of srauta activities, with the  yajna of Lanka and three Bulusus, Duvvuri Yajulu’s paundarika, Baballa’s

aruna-ketuka, and others. Laksminarayana and Kamsvari set the fires and  began agni-hotra twice daily, routine isti for new and full moon, and the  annual agrayana. Like Lanka, however, he waited several years before his  first soma ritual, finally performing agni-stoma in 1970 with Lanka as adh 

varyu, Mitranarayana as brahman, Kamesvara and other Konasima pandits  among the eighteen rtvij. 

Laksminarayana was known for fidelity to his fires and isti. He and his  sons were frequently seen collecting dead wood for kindling, making noises  in the scrub trees to scare off snakes. He was faithful in agrayana on amavasya or purnima of a harvest month, usually favoring the time of Dipavali. The sra vana pasu he performed once only, immediately after his agni-stoma. No other  srauta karma were projected. 

Smarta employment was not a career choice and the family’s economic  situation was consistently shaky. It was only about 1986 at age sixty-six that  Laksminarayana entered the TTD lists, and then as a non-reciting pensioner,  a vrddha pandit. He and the family were relieved to have an assured monthly  income at last. In later years the lack of rtvij was worrisome and at times his  Telugu pandit son, Laksmi Narasimha Murti, a schoolteacher, would stand in  as one. 

Kamesvari Somi-devamma died in 1996 and took the three fires with her  in the brahma-medha supervised by Duvvuri Yajulu and Bulusu Cayanulu of  Sriramapuram, with Bulusu Kamesvara of Vyaghresvaram also present. Due  to the couple’s advanced age, fires had lapsed some three or four years earlier.  The laukika arani and “the other,” a euphemism for the female kindling block,  were saved as the final pair of ritual implements necessary to churn fire for  the cremation of Laksminarayana only two years later. There were no legatees  of the Pullela lineage continuing “vedam-lo.”
