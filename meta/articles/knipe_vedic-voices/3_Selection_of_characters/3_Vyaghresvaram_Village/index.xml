      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to Bulusu Cayanulu’s family in Sriramapuram there was another  Bulusu lineage a short distance away in the village of Vyaghresvaram.  Tucked away among palm groves off the main road from Mukkamala Lock to  Amalapuram is a small village named for Siva as Lord of Vyaghra, the tiger.  The soft rumble of wooden bullock-cart wheels on dirt tracks is still a pleasing  sound there today. Only a ten-minute bicycle ride from Sriramapuram, it seems  as quiet and undisturbed now as Nedunuru was in 1980, far from motor traf&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The third ahitagni who established fires in Vyaghresvaram village in the  1960s was Pullela Laksminarayana, Kaundinya gotra, born in 1920 in  Narendrapuram on the Gannavaram Canal beside the Vasistha Godavari  River. As a new agni-stomin about 1970 at the age of fifty, his full name  became Pullela Laksminarayana Soma-yajulu and his wife became Kamesvari  Somi-devamma. He was the only son of an ahitagni. Sripada Laksmi Narasimha  Soma-yaji, a maternal uncle in Tondavaram, was another strong motivator for  Laksminarayana’s srauta career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
