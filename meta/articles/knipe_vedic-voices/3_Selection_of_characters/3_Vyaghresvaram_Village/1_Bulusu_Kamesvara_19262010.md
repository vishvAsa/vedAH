In addition to Bulusu Cayanulu’s family in Sriramapuram there was another  Bulusu lineage a short distance away in the village of Vyaghresvaram.  Tucked away among palm groves off the main road from Mukkamala Lock to  Amalapuram is a small village named for Siva as Lord of Vyaghra, the tiger.  The soft rumble of wooden bullock-cart wheels on dirt tracks is still a pleasing  sound there today. Only a ten-minute bicycle ride from Sriramapuram, it seems  as quiet and undisturbed now as Nedunuru was in 1980, far from motor traf 

fic noise and bustle, as remote as any village could possibly be in twenty-first  century-India. Long ago, the visitor is told, a Brahman was treed here by a  roving tiger. The tree he escaped into happened to be a Bilva, sacred to Siva.  The Brahman prayed and did a treetop puja to “Vyaghresvara-maha!” When  he finished his worship the tiger had changed into a Siva linga, and the name  of the place became Vyaghresvara-puram, later shortened to Vyaghresvaram.

Here this second Bulusu family raised two brothers, the elder named  Vyaghresvara after the village and the younger named Kamesvara. Close by,  the Pullela family raised their son, Laksminarayana. All three were destined  to become ahitagni in this quiet agrahara-like neighborhood. The father of the  Bulusu boys, a schoolteacher in Munganda, did not set the fires, but his father  and father’s brother had both been ahitagni. The latter, Antana, went on to per 

form cayana, so the young boys had two older models in srauta, their grandfather  and uncle. In addition, strong influence came from two itinerant promoters of  srauta, as energetic as they were charismatic, Renducintala Yajulu, who had once  been a student in Vyaghresvaram village, and Kapilavayi Yajnesvara Agnihotra,  who was born in Konasima. In April 1967 the Bulusu brothers established fires  and performed yajna together on consecutive days, sharing rtvij: Vyaghresvara’s  adhana first, Kamesvara’s adhana second, Vyaghresvara’s agni-stoma beginning  immediately, followed by Kamesvara’s agni-stoma. At this point the older brother  became Bulusu Vyaghresvara Soma-yaji, the younger one Bulusu Kamesvara  Soma-yajulu, and both wives added Somi-devamma to their given names. 

Vyaghresvara, as older son, inherited their ahitagni grandfather’s ancestral  home in the center of the village and Kamesvara established a separate resi dence for his family nearby. Kamesvara encouraged his older brother to go on  and perform cayana as their uncle had done. But Vyaghresvara was reluctant  and said “No, no, you do it!” and eventually this older brother was instrumen tal in making preparations for agni-cayana to be performed by Kamesvara.  Suddenly, however, Vyaghresvara died. A dispirited Kamesvara and his wife  Satyavati abandoned their plans for additional sacrifices beyond the nitya rituals of agni-hotrin and patni. At this point the once vigorous srauta life of  Vyaghresvaram village remained with Kamesvara and Satyavati. 

Bulusu Vyaghresvara’s untimely death occurred long before he could be  interviewed. The experiences and reflections of Kamesvara and Satyavati  must be representative. Kamesvara, born in 1926, received his sacred thread  at age seven and then spent thirteen years about six miles away in Indupalli  learning Veda from his guru, Rani Hayagriva Avadhani, the same Rani who  was Samavedam’s third guru. The Apastamba Sutras he received from his  older brother Vyaghresvara. He was married to Satyavati (named for the god 

dess of the famous temple of Satyanarayana and Satyavati on the hillltop of  Annavaram in the north of the district) before completing Veda at age twenty.  Together they raised ten children—six sons and four daughters. Neither of  the Bulusu brothers succeeded in teaching Veda to sons. But like Lanka and  Anasuya, Kamesvara and Satyavati did marry one daughter to a Veda pandit,  Sripada Manikya Avadhani Ghanapati of the Kamesvari agrahara outside of  Nedunuru, and he is still eligible to set the fires if so inclined.

Soft-spoken Kamesvara’s gaze was open and direct, augmented by an easy  smile. Satyavati is forthright, good-humored, affable, another ready smile brack eted by high cheekbones and twinkling eyes. And always she was completely  focused on the conversation. Of all the ahitagni-patni couples interviewed for this  survey during more than three decades, this pair was the most congenial and  forthcoming regarding intimate details of their life of srauta. Upon first inquiry  regarding their agni-hotra hearths, these were immediately shown with all ritual  implements exhibited and explained in detail. There was no hesitation about  purity. It was, of course, a period when the fires had lapsed for contingencies and  before they were to be rekindled with appropriate prayascittas for the interruption.  With both there was not the slightest reluctance to share personal relationships  with Agni, nor any dissimulation regarding their srauta schedules. Satyavati, as  knowledgeable as Kamesvara, adds a wealth of information about their thirty-five  years of agni-hotra together, commenting on ritual terms while drinking tea or  coconut juice and sitting alongside. Along with Maruti, wife of Kapilavayi Rama  Sastri in Annavaram, she was one of only two patni to be so well informed, artic ulate, comfortable with male guests, and eager to contribute from her consid 

erable knowledge and experience. Many of her observations are cited below in  Chapter  4. (See Figure 3.14, Kamesvara and Satyavati, Vyaghresvaram 2005, and  Figure 2.6 earlier, the couple beside their hearths, Vyaghresvaram, 2000.)

Over the years Kamesvara estimated that he had been invited to some  twenty-five to thirty srauta rituals, including vaja-peya, paundarika, and other  cayana. For some of these he was rtvij, including the role of adhvaryu. None of  the three or four students who began Veda with him completed the Taittiriya  sakha. He was, however, more successful in teaching smarta to almost thirty  students, continuing to teach well beyond his eightieth year; most of these  students are now employed as smarta pandits in Hyderabad or other parts  of the state. Kamesvara’s Vedic continuity is assured, if not in sons, cer tainly in the excellence of mantras recited in rituals over much of Andhra.  Kamesvara died in 2010 at the age of eighty-four, last of the ahitagni in the  Sriramapuram-Vyaghresvaram-Nedunuru circle, leaving only Mitranarayana  in the broader area.
