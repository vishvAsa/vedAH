title = "5 Srauta-kaksa, Ritual Rivalry"

+++

Over several decades both contemporary Kapilavayi brothers have narrated with out hesitation the ritual rivalry in which their father was engaged. What is termed  srauta-kaksa, rivalry in both performance and knowledge of srauta, is as old as  the rituals.[^11] 

The expectation of a great many texts, the new or full-moon sacrifice  every fortnight, for example, is that the sacrificer has enemies, one adversary in particular who is to be brought to mind. For the Kapilavayi family it is the  Dendukuris of Vijayawada, Krishna District, who serve this age-old function, particularly after Yajnesvara built his house there in 1975. Evidence of this divisive  relationship comes mainly from debates in assemblies that occurred long ago. 

[[128]] vedic voices 

Only the Kapilavayi side of these verbal combats is known and mentioned here;  no doubt the Dendukuri case would be weighted quite in another direction. Several matters have been fissiparous. 

- Kapilavayis claim that Dendukuris  failed to invite anyone from Konasima to a particular sacrifice and were therefore shunned when Dendukuri requests were made for rtvij.  
  Forced to turn  to Daksina (southern, i.e., Tamil Nadu) pandits, they eventually introduced a  southern gana of the Sama Veda to replace the traditional one that Yajnesvara  taught to his sons and recommended generally as the “Andhra” gana.  
  “How  could we use someone else’s gana?” the Kapilavayis demand. 
- Another bone of contention had to do with multiple sacrifices, whether or not two can be performed in the same area simultaneously.  
  Yajnesvara said yes with qualifications:  
  the sacrificers may not be related or friends,  
  the two  venues must be separated by a river or hill  
  and beyond earshot of one another.  

Some topics were presented to the Swami at Kanci pitha and, according to the  Kapilavayi account, he accepted the textual evidence supplied by Yajnesvara.  
Here the narrative turns deadly.  
It is claimed that abhi-cara was employed  against both Yajnesvara and Lanka, the latter having sided with Yajnesvara in  the dispute.  
Lanka became seriously ill according to the Kapilavayis, employed  countermeasures, probably mantras from the Atharva Veda, and survived.  

Yajnesvara also fell ill but despite last-minute awareness of the source of his  affliction, abhi-cara, he was defenseless and died at the age of seventy-four in  November 1983.  
Animosity lives on a generation later in this Andhra version  of Hatfields versus McCoys. 

Over the years other issues have been mentioned  
and these are of interest in the history of Vedic practice.

From the Kapilavayi side is the charge that  
some Dendukuri rtvij are ineligible for performance because they did not marry  pre-pubertal brides.  

A  broader charge is that the Dendukuris have created a  “business” (inserting the English word) out of srauta,  
spending their time solic iting money for sacrifices  
without considering their transcendent value  
and performing abbreviated rites in less than half the time required in order to pad their  resumes.  
The Dendukuris could no doubt reply that the very thin srauta record  of Konasima in recent years has produced resentment, essentially sour grapes.  

But once a multigenerational rivalry is in motion consequences radiate outward  in the form of alliances, rejections, and manifold marital liaisons. 

For example, the Dendukuris contributed to the financing of Duvvuri  Yajulu’s paundarika,  
thus co-opting him as ally  
but further alienating others  in Sriramapuram and Nedunuru.  
Yajulu was strategically “bought,”  
declared  one elder pandit who is neither a Kapilavayi nor a Dendukuri.  
He described  srauta-kaksa as “all politics.”  
Of course, marriage is also understood by some as  “all politics,”  
and complicated multigeneration marital alliances  
have further  added to the dynamics of rival factions.

Both the Duvvuris and the Dendukuris have multiple marriage arrangements with the Gullapallis,  
the West Godavari  family surveyed next in this account. 
 As an old Arab proverb has it, “the enemy  of my enemy is my friend,” and friends are always in short supply. 

In March 2005 the dora paid a visit to the Dendukuris in Vijayawada  along with Duvvuri Yajulu’s grandson, Sita Ram Sastry,  
who was warmly  greeted amid high praise of his “fifteen-generation” Vedic ancestry  (Dendukuris claiming only ten generations on their resumés).  
It was a  remarkable occasion, entering the little house smack up against a cinema  hall on a crowded lane of an expansive, noisy city and finding not one but  two tretagni hearths in action,  
one of Dendukuri Agnihotra Somayaji, the  other of his second son, Laksminarasimha Somayajulu. (See Figure 3.20,

Immediately, Sanskrit and Telugu books and palm leaf manuscripts emerged from great plastic bags, professionally xeroxed  color copies of impressive resumés were distributed, expensive albums[[131]] of hundreds of color photos of sacrifices were passed, and, as anticipated,  requests were made for substantial rupee or dollar funds to continue regu lar isti and upcoming major srauta sacrifices. 

These requests were renewed not once but over and over. It was not the  aparigraha ambiance surrounding Sita Ram Sastri or Baballa, Lanka, Yajulu,  Mitranarayana, and others in Konasima. The subject of srauta-kaksa with the  Kapilavayis never surfaced through all the blatant demands for money. In  an attempt to enter the Dendukuri mind a perspective is recognizable: World maintaining sacrifices must be perpetuated and to that end solicitation of funds,  an age-old requisite, is not for personal gain but for yajna. For the dora, being  seen and pressured only as an ATM machine was an uncomfortable situation. 

Nevertheless, it was readily apparent that a research focus on Vijayawada  rather than Konasima would have resulted in quite a different account. The  critical srauta period for the latter was drawing to a close in the 1980s whereas it  was still building in Vijayawada, 180 miles to the west. By late 2005 Dendukuri  Senior reported that there were twenty ahitagni in Krishna District, twelve of  them in Vijayawada, including the two nitya-agnihotrin Dendukuris and members of the Renducintala, Visnubhatla, Kappagantulu, Madduri, and other  families. 

After his 1965 agni-stoma in Vijayawada, Dendukuri Agnihotra’s  aggressive pursuit of srauta surged in the 1990s and earned him the title  “Bahu-yaji.” A vaja-peya, sarvato-mukha, aruna-ketuka, three paundarika, and  other rituals shine from his resume pages. He taught all three sons, married  both daughters to Veda pandits, founded a sabha, and is clearly a pivotal main stay of Krishna Delta Vedic life. 

Although he counts him as adversary, Kapilavayi Venkatesvara nevertheless  grants Dendukuri Senior full credit for “competence in all eighteen rtvij roles,  like Lanka.” A small, nervous man, Dendukuri Agnihotra, constantly leaving  the crowded room to talk on his cell phone while leaning over the adjacent  agni-hotra hearths, appears driven to excel in a competitive family environment.  His grandfather, father, and older brother Paundarika Yajulu all became ahitagni.  His father decided to trade their quiet village Nallapadu in Guntur District for  the boisterous hub of Vijayawada. Agnihotra, despite diabetes and joint pains,  is determined to surpass all of their records, not to mention the hallmarks of  twentieth-century greats such as Kapilavayi Yajnesvara and Renducintala Yajulu. 

To return to the Godavari Delta once again, it would appear that any revival  of srauta traditions there will depend on the intentions of the Annavaram  Kapilavayi and Duvvuri Phani lineages. Kapilavayi Venkatesvara, now without a  wife, has given permission to younger brother Rama Sastri to go ahead of him  with fire setting and then agni-stoma, which are planned for the same day.

Rama  Sastri and Maruti hope to proceed in 2016 when he turns sixty and retires from Annavaram temple service. When Rama Sastri and Maruti establish fires, then  daughter Sita Nagalaksmi and husband Pavan Kumar Sarma in Guntur District  will proceed to do the same. In Annavaram, in addition to son Agnihotra, a reli able network of pandits for assistance remains in the temple area. Venkatesvara  once compared routine isti to a cricket match, assembling the right players and  getting them onto the field in time. While awaiting his own ritual entry to srauta routines Rama Sastri continues to aid others. In February–March 2014 his temple authorities sent him to Madirajugoduru village in Nellore District to advise  in proceedings for another vyudha paundarika, this time with Renducintala  Krishna Cayanulu as yajamana. (See Figure 3.22, the Kapilavayi brothers,  Simhacalam, 2014.) It now remains to survey one more family, the Gullapallis  of West Godavari District, a lineage with strong ties to Konasima.
