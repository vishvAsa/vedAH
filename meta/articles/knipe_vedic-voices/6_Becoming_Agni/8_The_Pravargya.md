title = "8 The Pravargya"

+++

A ritual sometimes inserted into the soma sacrifices between the diksa and the  three pressing days is the pravargya, basically an offering to the Asvins and  a few other deities of hot milk (cow’s and goat’s) plus ghee and curds. It is  often referenced as gharma, heat. Since it should be added during a second or  third soma sacrifice, not the soma-initiating agni-stoma for the couple, it has an  eccentric place in the sutras. The emphasis on heat brings to mind the cosmo 

gonic theme of tapas, heat, emergent from the dark primordial waters, as in  the famous late hymn of the Rg Veda, the nasadiya sukta, 10.129.3. In studied  preparation for the pravargya the sacrificer is supposed to encourage his inner  tapas. Both Tapas and Gharma are personalized as divine powers. The sun  (Savitr, Surya), source of light as well as heat, is thought to be strengthened by  this offering, just as in the two daily agni-hotra. 

A focus, however, on one implement of crucial import seems almost pre dictive of later devotional Hinduism. That object, known as Maha-vira, “great  hero,” is a three-tiered terra-cotta pot resembling a seated figure with head,  torso, and lower body. BSS has him created on the ritual ground from three  clay pinda, suggestive of funerary or ancestral symbolism in some early ver sion. ApSS 15.15.1 takes great pains to create a human effigy by careful place ment of sacrificial tools against the clay pot to represent all the bodily features  of Maha-vira: hair, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, right down to intestines, penis,  muscles, and nerves. For example, the veda munja-grass brush (“Brahma’s  moustache”) puts invisible hair on the unfired clay “head,” a black antelope  hide covers the pot with skin and body hair, curds and honey infuse blood,  crumbs of two baked purodasa loaves make nerves, and so forth. Such an effigy  calls to mind funerary texts, on one hand the cremation with sacrificial imple ments placed on the body (e.g. Baudhayana Pitrmedha Sutra 3.3),42 and on the  other hand the use of pratima or prati-rupa described in the construction of a  temporary “carry-over” body for the naked preta spirit after death.43

The pot is briefly enthroned in the manner of the soma stalks before they  are pounded and then Maha-vira is anointed with ghee. Special wooden tongs  enfold and lift the molded three-leveled pot from the firing embers as the  sacrificer addresses it: “I encompass you with heaven and earth.” It is seated  on munja grass on a disk of silver as a gold piece covers it. Maha-vira, also  addressed as Gharma, is identified with the sun and called Prajapati, lord  of creatures, and other supreme titles. The head serves as bowl above a cen 

tral channel meant for the hot liquid offering to fill and then boil over “in all  directions” and flash in the fire. AB 4.1–5 is a brief passage on the pravargya homologizing this moment to creation, milk as semen overflowing from pri apic Maha-vira into Agni as birthplace of the gods. 

In addition to milk and ghee, libations also include dadhi-gharma, hot  curds. Two purodasa loaves are offered, the first to day, the second to night.  The rite must be completed before sunset and no person should bring the  sacrifice to a halt by casting a shadow on the pot. There is a BSS option for the  sacrificer to be sole drinker of remnants after the offering but ApSS has them  shared with the priests and Konasima aligns with the latter. 

The wife, normally with specified mantras and kriya in sacrifices, has  a limited role since the patni sala is screened from viewing preparation of  Maha-vira. At the prompting of the prati-prasthatr, however, she recites TA  4.7.19 and in the closing ceremony outside the sadas she sings a saman along  with the six priests involved, the basic three, hotr, adhvaryu, and brahman, plus  agnidhra, prati-prasthatr, and prastotr, the last singing from the Sama Veda so  that all four Vedas are present. When asked what happens to Maha-vira when  the sacrifice is concluded Konasima Brahmans were not of one mind, men tioning immersion in the river, abandonment on an island, and delivery to the  uttara-vedi as options. 

Hans van Buitenen understood the pravargya as a mystery rite focusing  on the central icon, Maha-vira, that he renders as “Large man.” His exegesis  uncovers not only a break with a Vedic aniconic tradition but also certain fea tures unusual in srauta ritual, including the use of a special fire just north of  the garha-patya, an implement of clay, not wood, made on the ritual ground,  and the worship of an anthropomorphic figure, quite unlike the use of a gold  man (purusa) in the agni-cayana. In his view the rite evolved from a simple  libation of hot milk and ghee to the Asvins in the time of the RV and AV to  the actual worship of the Maha-vira figure and incorporation into the soma 

schedule of six pravargya, morning and afternoon for three successive days,  the intention being to encourage the sun’s victorious emergence from the  rainy season. The pravargya serves as well as an illustration of ritual expansion  from simple to complex.44
