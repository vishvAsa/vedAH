  <p>Essential for an understanding of the structure of Vedic tradition are certain  key terms that are common parlance among Vedic Brahmans. These will come  into play in the personal biographies in Chapter 3. The Glossary at the end of  the book includes these terms along with others appearing less frequently, all  of them being Sanskrit unless noted as Telugu. A reader may wish to refer back  to pages here at the outset of this chapter for context and details in addition to  the brief Glossary definitions. This chapter serves as a primer in living Vedic  tradition by introducing first the basic educational system of Vedic pandits  (Brahmans in hereditary Vedic families) as practiced today in coastal Andhra,  then an outline of choices for maintaining samsara, the worldly subsistence  of married and certified Veda pandit householders. The third section enters  the life of srauta, the extended sacrificial tradition of those who establish three  fires and become eligible to proceed to soma rituals.1 This requires presenta tion of a whole new vocabulary and advanced set of procedures. A fourth sec</p>
<p>tion follows with attention to the remarkable liaisons between householders,  both husband and wife, and their ritual hearth complex, known as agni-hotra and as Agni-hotra, the god Agni, Lord of the house and family.</p>
<p>During initial conversations in an agrahara it is immediately stressed  that certain Brahmans “exist in Veda,” vedamlo unnaru, a Telugu locative des ignation setting them apart from—and implicitly above—all others. A hier archy recognizes the special character of the Vaidika subcaste of Brahmans  who have retained “Brahmahood,” brahma-tva, while others have fallen  from their natural heritage and become laukika, literally “worldly,” secular  Brahmans. The latter are always the great majority of the Brahmana varna or class. The privilege of being first in the pecking order carries the burden  of being responsible for Veda. Having been born into the Taittiriya sakha,</p>
<p>Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 29</p>
<p>“branch,” of the Vedic textual corpus, the primary division of the Krsna or  Black Yajur Veda, a Vaidika boy of seven or eight years may be given over  to a guru for hearing and reciting back a lesson (adhyaya). It is a process of  reciting by heart a portion of the Taittiriya Samhita, the copious initial col</p>
<p>lection of this Black Yajur Veda. The English translation by A. B. Keith is 637  pages long, but of course the boy is aware not of pages but of oral lessons  broken into manageable portions.2 A “subject” or “course” of study might  be a more apt translation since his curriculum extends to eighty-two panna</p>
<p>over a period of eight to twelve years including text-courses well beyond  the Taittiriya Samhita. An American student may cover approximately the  same number of “subjects” of study in twelve years of grade school and high  school. Memorization, however, is quite another matter and in US schools  may be limited to a couple of resentfully learned poems or the Gettysburg  Address, all quickly forgotten.3</p>
<p>The boy begins his career as a reciter of Veda by undergoing the life-cycle  ritual (samskara) known as upanayana, investiture with a sacred thread over his  left shoulder. He hears from his guru his first mantra, the gayatri (also known as  the savitri), Rg Veda 3.62.10, concerning the divine sun, awakener of the mind:</p>
<p>tat savitur varenyam / bhargo devasya dhimahi / dhiyo yo nah pracodayat May we achieve the divine splendor of Savitr; may he illumine our minds.</p>
<p>He will recite the Gayatri and other mantras every day for the rest of his life in  sandhya-vandana while sprinkling water offerings at the samdhya, “joints” of  the day, twilight and dawn, when the sun (Savitr or Surya) sets or rises. This  initiation begins brahmacarya, the first of four asrama or stages of life, that of  the celibate student, brahmacarin. By becoming a Vedic student and reciting  Veda in sandhya-vandana he is already discharging one of the three important  rna, “debts,” in the life of every Brahman, the one to the ancient rsi who first  intuited the Veda (see Table 2.1). The other two he will pay off, respectively, to  the gods by sacrificing and to his ancestors by fathering children.</p>
<p>Table 2.1. The four asrama, stages of life in</p>
<p>classical Hinduism.</p>
<p>brahmacarin, Vedic student, maintaining brahmacarya, celibacy; grhastha, married householder, living in the grha, house;</p>
<p>vana prastha, “forest dweller,” retiring to the vana, forest;</p>
<p>samnyasin, ascetic, one achieving samnyasa, renunciation.</p>
<p>[[30]]</p>
<p>The upanayana ceremony involves the god Brhaspati, purohita (priest) of  the gods and also patron of learning. In Telugu he is known as Guru, the  deity of Thursday. AGS 4.10-11 with mantras in the second part of the sepa rate Mantrapatha supply a concise program for the seven- or eight-year-old  boy, beginning with his bath and the tonsure of his head with a razor. He is  instructed to place kindling sticks into the fire and then is directed to place  his right foot on a grindstone; put on a new loincloth, a belt of three strands  of munja grass, and a strip of antelope hide; then receive as staff (danda) a  slim branch from a palasa tree. He sprinkles himself three times with water  received into his cupped hands from the guru who places a three-stranded  white cotton thread over his right shoulder. After hearing initial mantras he  addresses his guru and declares himself ready as a brahmacarin.4</p>
<p>After this thread-investiture the student lives in the residence of his earthly  guru, in modern times most probably his father, grandfather, or older brother.  In other words, he continues to live at home. In earlier times, and in some  cases still today, the initial guru is an uncle or someone outside the immediate  family residence and the student then lives in the guru’s home and eats food  cooked by his guru’s wife, one who serves as interim mother. Proper food for  the growing boy is extremely important and serves not only as correct nurtur</p>
<p>ance for mind, body, and spirit but also a means of bonding with the larger  community. The brahmacarin goes about collecting food by begging from vari ous Vaidika Brahman houses in the agrahara or village. Like a honey bee col lecting pollen he is a “honey-maker,” madhu-kara, and cooked food is dropped  into a cloth bag slung from his neck that he extends toward the door when  a woman answers his call (see Figure 2.1). An alternative “begging” routine,  varalu, assigns the boy to a different house on each of the seven days of the  week, thus the Telugu plural of vara, weekday. Either way, he is in the mode  of the ascetic, the samnyasin or sadhu who is dependent on the largesse of  ordinary householders while on his spiritual quest. In his case it is the quest  for knowledge of Veda. A few boys may be enrolled by their parents in a Veda  patha-sala, a school for learning Veda such as the one in Kapilesvarapuram  shown in Figure 2.2.</p>
<p>Along with his daily meditation prayers the student also becomes con scious of his personal relationship with Agni through daily fire maintenance,  agni-karya, collecting kindling sticks (samidh), removing the ashes of old fires,  and tending the household fire of his guru (see Figure 2.3, a brahmacarin car rying a fire-pot in the house of his father and guru, a potential ahitagni). He is  rehearsing for that day when he first establishes a household fire for himself  and his wife. This may presage a far more intense, even mystical bond with  Agni if he later chooses to enter into srauta rituals as a srautin, fire-sacrificer,</p>
<p>Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 31</p>
<p>Figure 2.1. A brahmacarin at Surya’s door in madhu-kara, collecting food house  to house like a bee flower to flower, Sriramapuram 1987. The boy is Surya’s  thirteen-year-old grandson Phani.</p>
<p>relying on the Srauta Sutras that are themselves based on the Brahmana texts  (as distinct from the Grhya Sutras covering domestic rituals). At some point in his pre-teen or early teen years his parents arrange his  marriage to a younger pre-pubescent girl, the five-day ritual vivaha creating a  union to be consummated years later when he completes his Vedic learning  and is ready to advance to the second life-stage and become a householder.  This patni, wife, selected by his family, is traditionally from another Vaidika  family with similar heritage and should be the daughter of a woman who mar ried before puberty in a five-day ritual, thus doubly assuring purity of lineage  and ritual sanction. She will be chosen from a family inside the subcaste but  outside the gotra, clan lineage from one of the ancient sages, the rsi. In some  families the bride and groom have known each other from early childhood.  Often, however, the ceremony becomes “first sight,” and when the five festive  days are over it may be years before true acquaintance begins. If the bride grew  up in a household of Vedic reciters or sacrificers she will be entirely familiar</p>
<p>[[32]]</p>

<p>with the transmission of mantras, performance of rituals, and daily Vaidika  routines.5</p>
<p>Every day the new student will sit opposite his guru for the daily lesson.  (See Figure 2.4, a grandfather teaching a grandson, and Figure 2.5, another  grandfather teaching four grandsons at once.) Older pandits in this survey  started learning, and then eventually teaching sons, some time between 4 am</p>
<p>and dawn. In recent years public school has intervened for some families and  adhyaya may not begin until dawn has broken. In any case, if successful at  memorizing passages from either the third or fourth section of the Taittiriya  Samhita the student will persevere until he has mastered all seven sections  before going on to the next three major texts of his tradition, the Taittiriya  Brahmana, Taittiriya Aranyaka, and Taittiriya Upanisad. Supplementary les</p>
<p>sons will be taught from two ritual manuals preferred in Konasima that may  have been composed long ago in the Godavari Delta, one for great sacrifices,  the other for domestic rituals, respectively, the Apastamba Srauta Sutra and  Apastamba Grhya Sutra.6</p>

<p>Examinations and certification as a Veda pandit will follow this formal  phase of recitation that is significantly marked by a ritual bath, snana, herald ing his “return,” sama-vartana, from his guru. The boy will now be a young  man in his middle or late teens at liberty to continue textual and ritual tra ditions of his own choosing or remain under the guidance of his guru. To  appreciate the magnitude of this initial recitation achievement, traditionally a  basic education lasting eight to twelve years, printed versions in Devanagari  or Telugu script, or in English or other translation, could extend to well over  2,000 pages. One feature of this voluminous textual material, particularly true  of ritual texts, is an interweaving of essential paradigms; a student frequently  encounters passages he has already committed to memory, especially in the  transition from Samhita to Brahmana to Aranyaka.</p>
<p>Several critical events await the newly certified Veda pandit. The second  asrama or stage of his life, grhastha, is that of the householder. Although  marriage with a traditional five-day ritual had already taken place when he  was about nine to sixteen years old, and the younger bride selected for him  was perhaps between seven and twelve, the role of householder, including  cohabitation and ritual consummation, is not assumed until the bride, still  living with her parents, has experienced menarche. The certified Veda pandit  and his wife may now establish residence, take embers in a fire pan (ukha)</p>
<p>Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 35</p>
<p>from the marriage fire in her parents’ home and set a domestic fire for a new  “household,” either within or outside the joint family in which he has grown  up. The couple will now make daily offerings (homa) into this single fire, the  aupasana, also called the household (grhya) or domestic (smarta) fire. A cooked  rice and ghee offering inaugurates their new contract with Agni as lord of  their residence and the couple consumes the remains.7</p>
<p>The career of the married Veda pandit now follows a trajectory with mul tiple options. The Taittiriya Samhita is transmitted in several forms known as  vikrti, modifications of the “original” or model text. The student began with  the samhita, “continuous,” patha, “recitation.” After completing it he went on  with pada-patha, the same text over again broken down to separate “words,”  pada, without regard to grammatical rules that alter certain initial and final  letters when they coalesce. For a third review he receives the same text in  krama-patha, a “step-by-step” recitation. Some students do not go beyond the  first or second recitation pattern. Most young men, teenagers at this point,  stop after krama-patha with examination and certification.</p>
<p>If he still has nimble brain cells, however, a student may elect to repeat much  of what he has interiorized in a far more difficult recitation, the ghana-patha,  for example, a compact braided form that is popular among gifted students in  coastal Andhra, a few of them relying on careers as ghana-pathi, masters of ghana</p>
<p>who recite professionally at pandit assemblies, weddings, housewarmings, or  other auspicious occasions, often in groups of two, four, or more in antiphonal  response. The jata-patha is another difficult recitation pattern attempted briefly  by many but mastered by few. Popular among Nambudiri Brahmans in Kerala is  ratha-patha, the “chariot” recitation that has not been in style in coastal Andhra.</p>
<p>On the other hand, after the chain of Taittiriya Samhita, Brahmana,  Aranyaka, and Upanisad, the gifted student may turn to one of the other Vedas,  another sakha, and begin learning some portion of the Rg Veda, for example,  with the same or a different guru. If his family includes someone with knowl</p>
<p>edge of the Sama Veda, the Veda of saman, melodies in a seven-note scale, an  essential text for soma sacrifices, the student may elect to learn a segment of  that difficult text from him. There is particular pride in learning the “local”  Sama Veda since it is considered, rightly or wrongly, to be different not only  from the Jaiminiya, Kauthuma, and Ranayaniya recensions (the latter two con</p>
<p>sidered by some Western scholars to be virtually the same), but also different  from versions employed by other Taittiriyins.8</p>
<p>Now a young man with increasing ability, probably living with his wife  and starting a family, he may choose further studies with a pandit elsewhere  in the agrahara, or in another village or town. His options may also include  extra-Vedic texts, Mimamsa, for example, to develop his expertise in Vedartha,36 vedic voices</p>
<p>inquiry into the meaning of the Veda, or another of the philosophical schools,  or Vyakarana, the study of grammar, or domestic rituals in the Smarta curricu lum. Another choice might be study of the Apastaba Dharma Sutra, consid ered to be the earliest of this genre, along with its commentaries. Certification  from any further studies will add to his credentials and increase his authority  when he attends a local or regional pandit assembly, a sabha, for debates and  exchanges of information on current Vedic events. If he becomes certified in  the Apastamba texts for domestic rituals, often a father-to-son transmission of  expertise, he may also become a family purohita, priest, for other Brahmans,  asked to conduct marriages, housewarmings, thread ceremonies for Brahman  boys, or other smarta (domestic) rites for small honoraria.</p>
<p>In lineages of srauta sacrificers he might be recruited into a role as rtvij,  one of the staff of four priests necessary for fortnightly offerings known as isti on new or full-moon days and annual harvest rites, or even one of the sixteen  to eighteen priests in an extended rite such as a fire-altar construction lasting  forty days. In other words, after “graduating” from celibate studentship and  becoming a householder, the Veda pandit is engaged in post-graduate studies,  the lifelong learning that is the mark of agrahara residents who never seem  to cease their quest for knowledge. And of course “the Veda,” with hundreds  of primary, acolyte, and commentarial texts, provides unbounded territory for  exploration.</p>
<p>Apastamba’s Sutras are the preferred manuals, the Grhya Sutra pertaining  to domestic rites, various life-cycle rites, for example, and the Srauta Sutra  detailing with more elaborate rituals of the three-fire system, including the  initiatory yajna (sacrifice), the offering and drinking of soma in the agni-stoma,  a ritual in praise of Agni. There are also the Sravana-pasu animal sacrifice  in July-August; the annual agrayana first-fruits sacrifice for new crops, espe</p>
<p>cially rice, usually in October-November; and the building of the fire altar, the  agni-cayana, with its multiple versions that include a local favorite, the paun darika. Both Sutras are like palimpsests, the original texts layered with com mentaries, instructions, and interpretive notes that can be followed minutely  or modified in innumerable directions. Baudhayana, Hiranyakesin, and other</p>
<p>Sutras are used as backups, but usually Apastamba is consulted first. One who learns some portions of the Rg Veda may also learn its Asvalayana  Sutras, and one who receives segments of the Atharva Veda may add some  of the Kausika Sutra and the Gopatha Brahmana. Some of the ahitagni lin eages cherish handwritten books of srauta instructions, particularly regard ing soma sacrifices, and these precious records are in the careful script of  great-grandfathers, grandfathers, and fathers. A concomitant result of these  familial traditions is that some rituals, both domestic (grhya) and extended</p>
<p>Vedamlo, “Living in the Veda” 37</p>
<p>(srauta), may have idiosyncratic versions to which guest priests from other  families must be willing to grant accommodation.</p>

<p>without origin; it is apauruseya, without human authorship. There is no liter ary “chronology” as in modern historical scholarship and therefore a passage  in an “early” portion of the Rg Veda that outside scholars might date to the  mid-second millennium bce is part of the same eternal text as an Upanisad  dated by text-critical scholars to be well over a thousand years later. Among  Veda pandits there is no debating this issue. Contemporary historical schol ars have perceived a distinction between a “pre-classical” Vedic period from  c. 1200 to c. 800 bce and the subsequent “classical” era that lasted several  centuries after 800. Following a survey of selected families of Veda pandits  in Chapter 3, Chapter 4, “Becoming a Veda,” provides a more nuanced dis cussion of textual learning, application of such skills, and opportunities for  the study of other Vedic and post-Vedic texts. Similarly, Chapters  5 and 6,  “Becoming a Householder,” and “Becoming Agni,” are, respectively, more rig orous pursuits of the domestic and extended ritual traditions.</p>
