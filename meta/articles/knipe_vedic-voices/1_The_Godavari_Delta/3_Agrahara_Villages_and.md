Pilgrimage Towns 

When the dora (the author of this book) and his wife began residence directly  on the left bank of the undivided Godavari in 1980, the state of Andhra  Pradesh, an area slightly less than the Italian peninsula, had a population  of about 53 million. By 2011 the population had ballooned to nearly 85 mil 

lion, an increase of 32 million, well over the combined populations of all five  Scandinavian countries, and Andhra was adding more than a million per year.  Substantial transformations of landscape and culture were quite apparent all  the while.

The search for ahitagni began in the village of Munganda close to the left  bank of the Vasistha Godavari.38 No Vedic ritualists were to be found, and  teaching of the Vedas had long since expired. Authentic Vedic sacrificers, how ever, were reported to be living in agrahara not far away, although at the time,  winding, deteriorating roads and footpaths made the distance seem daunting.  Directions northeast to a cluster of villages hugging the Billakurru Canal (west  of Nedunuru on Map 2) led to a wide neighborhood that included six ahitagni and several other pandits vigorously teaching Veda. 

An agrahara, an entirely Brahman community, is usually an appendage  of a village or hamlet, separated, private, yet close enough to obtain necessary  supplies and household or field labor from the larger adjoining settlement.  Those discussed here are donations of land by wealthy admirers of Vedic tradi 

tion who provided plots for house construction and small amounts of rice and  coconut acreage for Veda pandits and a few other Brahmans.39 Such gifts of  land have a long history. Cynthia Talbot notes a special tradition in medieval  Andhra, sapta-santana, “seven offerings,” by which donors could perpetuate  their names.40 In addition to having a son, other legacies include provision of  a deity image to a temple, constructing a tank for water supply, and donating  an agrahara. Agrahara have secluded lanes, what might be called gated com 

munities in America. Although invisible, the gateway is clearly understood by  the far larger non-Brahman population as a threshold into a zone of privilege.  Crop fields are sometimes intruded upon, not residential lanes. 

Sriramapuram agrahara, established in 1940 in land grants to respected  Veda pandits by a wealthy merchant, Dokka Rama, originally contained a sin gle straight dirt lane of fourteen houses and a panca-ayatana (five-deity) tem ple housing Isvara, Radha-krsna, Surya, Ambika, and Vighnesvara (Ganesa)  (see Figure 0.6). Added to the lane over the years were a small school, play ground, post office, and two separate shrines for Subrahmanya and Dattatreya,  respectively. Although all Brahman, an agrahara such as Sriramapuram is by  no means uniform. Vaidika Brahmans live distinct lives and do not marry or  dine with laukika non-Vaidika Brahmans living next door. Within Vaidikas, the  families of ahitagni cannot eat food cooked by non-ahitagni wives. 

Kamesvari agrahara, more remote from any main road, has only a few  houses on a trio of adjoining short lanes. At the height of Vedic activity in  Konasima, four ahitagni, sacrificers who maintain three sacred fires in their  homes, and several other Veda pandits who taught Vedas to their own sons  and often to the sons of others, lived in these two agrahara less than three  miles apart on opposite sides of the Amalapuram canal. A mile and a half west  of Sriramapuram is the village of Vyaghresvaram, at one time agrahara-like 

The Godavari Delta 25 

in size, and the locus of three other ahitagni, creating a circle of seven within  walking distance of one another. 

Another Vedic community that blurs the distinction between agrahara and village is Iragavaram, West Godavari District, where a strong presence of  Veda pandits in a Brahman hamlet maintains a multigenerational heritage.  Iragavaram is across the Godavari River from Konasima in what became West  Godavari District after the division of Godavari District into two parts. 

Kakinada town, some twenty-five miles northeast of the Sriramapuram Vyaghresvaram-Nedunuru cluster but only fifteen miles north of the Gautami  Godavari, is a seaport on the Bay of Bengal. The next locus for this narra tive, it is home to a single ahitagni, Bhamidipati Mitranarayana. Formerly  known as Cocanada, the town is the seat of government for East Godavari  District. On the shore of the Bay of Bengal it is the largest seaport between  Vishakhapatnam and Machilipatnam. Strong canals from all directions have  provided fresh water for a century and a half. Despite small industries and  ship traffic there are still beautiful stretches of sand beaches close to town. 

Nomenclature for the region is sometimes confusing although not as dras tic as the change in name from Madras to Chennai. As Cocanada became  Kakinada and Machilipatnam became the modern name for Masulipatam, so  did Daksarama evolve into Draksarama. Vijayawada is still frequently referred  to as Bezwada, its medieval name. 

Many other towns come into the conversations of the pandits, their  wives, and children, particularly the many pilgrimage goals (tirtha) in the  sacred geography of coastal Andhra. The medieval period produced a num ber of Hindu temples that achieved fame through their mahatmya, Sanskrit  or Telugu depictions of their foundation mythologies and subsequent histo ries. Undoubtedly the primary target today is the Tirupati Vaisnava temple  complex of the Lord of the Seven Hills, Venkatesvara, patron deity of Andhra.  Until recently the temple took pride for many decades in its reputation as the  wealthiest in India. In the town in the valley lives Venkatesvara’s sister, the  feared goddess Gangamma.41 

While in this southernmost tip of Andhra many pilgrims broaden sectar ian devotion by having darsana of the linga in the Saiva temple at Kalahasti,  only twenty-two miles from Tirupati. The temple dates from the Pallava  dynasty, rebuilt in the eleventh century by a Cola king. Kalahasti owns one  of the five elemental linga of Saivism, the panca-bhuta linga, this one of wind,  Vayu, the name of a Vedic god with Indo-Iranian roots. It is also the site where  Kanappa, a devotee famous in Tamil Saiva hagiography, offered his eyes to  restore those of a bleeding linga. Kalahasti boasts of being the southern Kasi  (Varanasi, Benares).26 vedic voices 

In addition to Draksarama, described earlier, three more of the sacred  arama are in the delta. One is Bhimavaram (with another Bhima temple) and  a second is Kurma arama, Turtle Grove, in a village better known as Kotipalli  frequented by the Vedic rsi Kasyapa. Siva as Lord of soma, the sacred Vedic  plant, resides in his temple there. The third is Palakol (Palakollu), also known  as Ksiraratna, the Milk Grove, with a linga temple now known via sectarian  blending as Ksira Rama-lingesvara. 

All of these towns with medieval temples attract great crowds of pilgrims,  particularly at Maha-Sivaratri, the “great night of Siva” when everyone remains  awake in devotion. Fierce gods—Virabhadra, Rudra, Bhima, Bhairava,  Narasimha—as well as Bhadrakali and other ferocious goddesses of every  stripe seem to dominate the landscape from their thousand-year-old palaces  of stone. 

Other coastal Andhra pilgrimage goals within reach of bus, train, or boat  include two temple towns that employ a pair of prominent Veda pandit broth ers featured in this book. One will most likely become an ahtagni in 2016.  One town is Simhacalam west of Visakhapatnam with its eleventh-century  hill temple enclosing a Siva linga for an entire year but for the one day in  May when sandal paste somehow melts away to reveal an image of the  Vaisnava god Narasimha, the true lord of Simhacalam who destroyed the  demon king Hiranyakasipu precisely there. The other town is Annavaram in  the north of East Godavari District with an equally popular temple, also on a  hilltop, Ratnagiri, residence of the god Satyanarayana and goddess Satyavati.  Annavaram also demonstrates sectarian rapprochement since the Vaisnava  god is flanked by a Siva linga as well as the goddess. 

Until recent improvement of roads approaching their towns, two renowned  temples exacted intimidating journeys from pilgrims. One is Bhadracalam,  accessible by boat some one hundred miles up the Godavari from Rajahmundry.  Boat people still today are reluctant to go ashore in mid journey. Invariably  they “cut” white chickens and break coconuts for the Breech Mother goddess  Gandi Posamma at the wide bend of the river south of Devipatnam in hopes  of avoiding tigers, crocodiles, and bandits. Only the last have actually been  sighted for a generation. She stands guard exactly where treacherous territory  begins, with a gleaming five-foot sword in her right hand. Beyond the break in  the Northern Circars, Bhadracalam is the site of a temple of Rama built at the  place where Sita was kidnapped by Ravana. Temple attendants reveal bedrock  that bled when construction began, declaring that the great goddess is there,  and was there, before the Ramayana heroes. 

The other remote temple is Srisaila, the only south Indian temple men tioned in the Mahabharata. Millions of pilgrims have worn the road’s

cobblestones into rounded knobs as smooth as eggs. Located on a wilderness  hilltop high above the Krishna River, the temple is the sacred space of Siva as  Mallikarjuna and goddess Bhramaramba, a manifestation of Kali. As the linga in Kalahasti is one of five elements, this Srisaila linga is one of a famous set of  twelve jyotir linga, forms of divine light. 

Pilgrims count other towns on their itineraries as well. They visit Kanaka  Durga in her hilltop temple in Vijayawada, Narasimha in yet another of his  temples atop the elephant-shaped hill in nearby Mangalagiri, and Markandeya  in his temple on the Godavari River in Rajahmundry (Rajahmahendravaram),  an eleventh-century fortress town now favored as cultural center for coastal  Andhra. Considered the birthplace of the Telugu language, Rajahmundry was  the home of the poet Nannaya, author of three books of the Telugu Mahabharata.  His benefactor was Rajaraja Narendra, the Calukyan king of Vengi during  the first half of the eleventh century. Every twelve years Rajahmundry hosts  “Pushkaram” when the Godavari takes its turn among India’s greatest rivers  for pilgrim bathers. In 2003 some 34 million were claimed by locals to have  taken the sacred dip at half a dozen revu, the Telugu word for bathing ghats. 

Throughout coastal Andhra, in softer focus and without literary recogni tion but for an occasional paper pamphlet, are numerous diminutive temples  and shrines of neighborhood goddesses, many of them renowned for resident  possession ritualists who embody them and become their voices in service of  supplicants.42 They are to be located mostly on word-of-mouth maps still in  use by the roughly one-third of the population who do not read. 

Further remarks on agrahara will precede the capsule biographies of Veda  pandits at the outset of Chapter 3 and the lives of householders living in these  Brahman communities will be the subject of Chapter 5.43
