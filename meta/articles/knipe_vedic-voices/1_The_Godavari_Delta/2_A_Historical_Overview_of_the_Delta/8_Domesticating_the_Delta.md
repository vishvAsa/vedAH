title = "8 Domesticating the Delta"

+++

Everywhere on domestic, business, and civic walls, and especially on trees at  crossroads and river banks, there are posters and statues of divine beings— Hanuman, Ganesa, all possible avatara of Devi, Siva, or Visnu, and the occasional  god-man or god-woman stepping back from history into myth—Shirdi Sai Baba  or Sarada Devi, for example. Images of two male figures with historical focus  are ubiquitous in the delta, as indeed they are in most of India. One is Gandhi,  seated cross-legged or in mid-stride, staff in resolute hand, spectacles prominent  on a wizened face. The other is the Dalit and neo-Buddhist hero B. R. Ambedkar  posed stiffly in white shirt, red tie, and improbable blue suit, his arm pointing  out the hope of progress somewhere on the horizon. But in the water-rich deltas  of the Godavari and Krishna, as nowhere else in the subcontinent, a third male  figure may be seen in landscape statuary, either in standing pose alone in the flat  space of a paddy field or in the saddle of a spirited brown stallion. 

Remarkably, since most other signs of the Raj have been thoroughly scrubbed  away in more than sixty years of independence, this modest black-suited figure  is a white man, namely, Sir Arthur Cotton, the nineteenth-century British mil itary officer and civil engineer who tamed the indomitable Godavari River at  the end of its rush across the Deccan to the sea. His extraordinary accomplish ments began with transformation of the former Rajahmundry District from  one of the poorest and most famine-prone to the rice-basket of south India.  The delta was accordingly renamed Godavari District and statues of a white  man, a saint although a dora, a Foreigner, sprouted from this well-watered,  now fruitful land. 

In 1844, Cotton (1803–99) studied the Godavari flood plain and visual ized the building of a 2.25-mile-wide masonry anicut forty-eight-feet thick,  a weir or dam known locally as a barrage. He envisioned it across the river  at Daulesvaram with a series of sluice gates leading into several hundreds of

canals that would not only control the flow of water for irrigation but also cre ate safe river traffic of 1,500 miles for both goods and people (see Figure 1.1).  Begun in 1847, completed only five years later in 1852, this enormous project  changed agricultural life in its rhythms, output, and diversity, and made the  delta a prime example of the benefits of large-scale hydraulic engineering.  The horrendous rampages of monsoon flooding on the many streams of the  delta, an annual rearrangement of every island and shore for scores of miles,  became a thing of the past, although serious floods from breeches of levees,  locally known as bands, still occur, most recently in 1986 when the river  crested at Rajahmundry and left damaged crops and dwellings along much of  its course. But the era of large-scale drought-related famines was ending. In  1832–33, after a cyclone killed tens of thousands outright, even more died of  famine because of devastated crops. 

In 1866 in Orissa, the state on the northern border of Andhra, 1.5 million  people starved to death. Cotton poked a finger in the eye of the government  that later was to knight him by calculating the exact number of cubic yards of  water and the two-thirds of a penny a pound for rice for four months of food  that would have saved the Orissans, not forgetting to cite the huge loss in gov 

ernment revenue because nothing was done. “How strange it seems that men  cannot understand this,” he wrote in 1881. In the newly renamed Godavari

District, after Cotton’s efforts and the irrigation of 600,000 acres, the popula tion increased 300 percent from 1843 to 1891. 

Cotton went on to tame the Krishna River Delta with another anicut west of  Rajahmundry at Vijayawada. He became chief engineer of Madras Presidency,  applying his skills in other parts of India as well. A huge waterway system was  envisioned, little of which was realized, that also included proposals for a vast  east coast set of canals for 380 miles between the Godavari and Madras, the  use of wind power to raise water for irrigation, possibilities in Egypt and the  Sudan, and even a fanciful vision of linked Indian and Chinese river systems  from the Brahmaputra to the Yangtze.30 

Transformation of the delta came about in many ways. Two years after  India’s first telegraph line was installed, the first passenger train chugged  along rails in 1853, with rapid expansion over the next several decades. Before  the close of that century it became essential for the Calcutta-Madras east coast  line to cross the Godavari at Rajahmundry, a formidable feat of railway engi 

neering over a wandering river. The first single-track rail line spanned the two  miles between Rajahmundry and Kovvur in 1897 on one of the longest bridges  in Asia. Through the 1980s the old puffer-billy steam locomotives were still  waking people of Rajahmundry before dawn as they performed their explo 

sive morning warm-ups like donkeys greeting the sun. Prior to road, rail, and  telegraph links connecting the western and eastern portions of the delta, boat  traffic was restricted to the calm seasons of the river. As will be apparent in  Chapter 3, deep-seated liaisons between Vaidika families in the delta, particu 

larly those for marital and ritual purposes, were vastly improved by a century  of enhanced communication, the latest innovation being a cell phone in every  household in each agrahara where no landline had previously existed. 

The destructive role of water can be far more than the expected annual  floods. The delta, wide open to the Bay of Bengal, is highly vulnerable to tropi cal cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons) and tsunamis roaring inland behind storm  surges, walls of ocean water ten to thirty feet high. Kakinada and Masulipatam  were destroyed by cyclones in the early nineteenth century and many storms  with high fatalities have struck since, most recently, 1969, 1977, 1984, 1990,  and 1996. The 1977 cyclone drove eight miles inland, killing nearly 10,000  people. TV and cell-phone evacuation warnings saved tens of thousands in the  cyclone of October 2013. 

During the period of research for this book, at 5 pm on November 6, 1996,  four days before the great autumn harvest festival of Divali, as Venkatesvara,  Lord of Andhra, was readied in his Tirupati temple for adornment with  diamond-studded gold jewels, a cyclone roared up through Konasima and  killed perhaps 2,000 people during a ten-hour rampage. Numbers were

imprecise when 1,400 villages were affected, virtually all mud-thatch houses  disappeared, and pakka houses of brick and cement blew down or became  roofless. Newly harvested paddy along with 1.5 million acres of rice fields were  destroyed, and the other lifeline, coconut palms, were decapitated with five to  eight years required to replace them. Konasima was several years in regaining  its cornucopia reputation. Venkatesvara, said many farmers, was angry with  us for our sins, while as many others feared it was their neighborhood god 

dess, who was sure to do it all again. No one spoke of many crores of rupees  devoted to sea walls on the east sides of towns that might have mitigated dam age. While engineering skills have largely tamed the river, winds and far off  earthquakes have remained wild. 

A significant aspect of neighborhood goddesses in villages, town, and cit ies is their ambiguity. They are fierce, violent, blood-demanding creatures,  carriers of epidemic diseases, destructive beyond measure. They are also  benevolent, merciful, loving, and maternal. Collectively, generically, they are  Ammavaru, Mother. Individually, in their temples and shrines, and in the  annual festivals in the neighborhoods they patrol from border to border, they  are Gangamma, Somalamma, Nukalamma, Paiditalli, and so on. The earlier  description exactly describes the delta’s great river, a life-giver, a life-taker.
