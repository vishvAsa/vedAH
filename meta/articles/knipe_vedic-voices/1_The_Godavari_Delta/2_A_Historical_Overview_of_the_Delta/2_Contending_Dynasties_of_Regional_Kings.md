title = "2 Contending Dynasties of Regional Kings"

+++

The boasts of “southern” supremacy by Satakarni I  and Kharavela would  no doubt have been ridiculed by kings and chieftains farther south. The  Ceras (Keralas) on the west coast, the Colas who gave their name to the  east coast (Coromandal, the mandala of Colas), and the Pandyas in between,  competed for power over the territory during the early centuries ce, a pot 

pourri of kingdoms controlling villages and extracting revenue not only in  Tamil Nadu, “land of the Tamils,” but also parts of the northern Deccan and  up the Kalinga coast. Romila Thapar has aptly dubbed such contention a  “see-sawing of dynasties” with relatively equal military strength repeatedly  replacing one another in the same region. Hermann Kulke and Dietmar  Rothermund extend the image to “triangular contests” since conflicts were  often more than one on one.4 

Saka hegemony was ended with the rise of the Gupta empire. Some six  centuries after the accession of Candragupta Maurya, another Candragupta,  again at Pataliputra, founded a new imperial dynasty that came to be labeled  in the north as India’s classical age, a period that produced enduring works  in Sanskrit such as the poetry and dramas of Kalidasa and the Kama Sutra  of Vatsyayana. The years of Candragupta’s rule were 320–35. His son,  Samudragupta (r. 350–75), and great-grandson, Kumaragupta (r. 415–55), the  fourth successive emperor, extended the dynasty. Samudragupta exercised  the asva-medha to lay claim to universal sovereignty, presumably after the

initial agni-stoma rituals with soma drinking. His extraordinary rampage  down the east coast across Kalinga and on south through Pistapura and  Vengi on the Coromandal coast, ended with Kancipuram in Tamil Nadu. That  thousand-mile campaign, a show of force against more than a dozen kings  and their armies and subjects, must have required more than one stalwart  royal mount. 

Coastal Andhra, however, like much of the south, remained isolated from  that “universe” celebrated in Pataliputra. In the south, the Pallavas attained  domination and at least one seventh-century king performed, after his agni stoma, the Vedic vaja-peya, the “drink of strength” sacrifice (both detailed  later in Chapter 6). He ruled in a dynasty that outlasted most mentioned  so far, extending from the sixth through the ninth centuries. Centered in  Kancipuram (Samudragupta’s momentary trophy), Pallava armies sub 

dued much of the peninsula, including the richly productive coastal zone  of “Vengi” from the Krishna Delta up to the Godavari Delta. Cynthia Talbot  mined epigraphic records and labeled Vengi as the “core area” of Andhra in  this period.5 Here again land grants to Brahmans were frequent and inscrip 

tions indicate migrations from the north to Andhra. One copper plate records  the donation of a village in Guntur District, west of the Krishna River, to one  thousand Brahmans from the village of Ahicchatra on the Ganges.6 In South  India, Grantha was a script descended from southern Brahmi in use for  writing Vedic and classical Sanskrit texts and one regional variant appeared  in Vengi.7 

New iterations of warring dynasties ushered in new royal names and  centers of contending power. The Calukya dynasty founder Pulakesin (c.  503–66) performed a celebratory asva-medha in his capital of Vatapi (later  named Badami, the site in Karnataka of impressive Saiva, Vaisnava, and Jaina  caves). Calukyas and Pallavas alternated control over the eastern Deccan in  the sixth and seventh centuries, the Eastern Calukyas at Pithapuram just east  of the Godavari Delta again playing a prominent role. Calukyas even fought  one another out of Badami and Kalyani in the west as well as Vengi and  Pithapuram in the east. 

An aggressive entrant into the tournament of warfare was the Rastrakuta  dynasty. In north India, Harsa had ruled successfully from Kanauj for the  first half of the seventh century, 606–47, until he was opposed by Pulakesin  II and his Calukyan armies. After Harsa’s death the Rastrakutas commanded  the Deccan while the Pratiharas took charge in the north and the Palas in the  east c.  750. Every century was scarred by wars either civil or interstate. As  Nilakanta Sastri observed, however, almost perpetual warfare did not obstruct  cultural growth. He cites the magnificent rock-cut Siva temple in the complex

of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jaina caves and temples at Ellora,8 carved under the  757–78 rule of the Rastrakuta king Krishna I during the period when Vengi on  the east coast was repeatedly changing administrations. 

It is difficult to separate hagiography from reliable history, but Saiva tradi tions credit Sankara, the eighth-century founder of the non-dualist Advaita  Vedanta school of philosophy, with the establishment of matha, religious cen ters, in the compass points of India’s geography. Kancipuram and Srngeri are  two in the south and a third, also neighboring Andha, is in Puri (Orissa) to  the east. Among Sankara’s many works are penetrating commentaries on the  Upanisads including the Taittiriya as well as the somewhat older Chandogya  and Brhadaranyaka. 

The decline of Buddhist influence in the Deccan was roughly parallel  to an ascent of Jainism. From their roots in Magadha, Jainas had migrated  south into Kalinga in the third century bce and then further south to Tamil  Nadu along merchant trade routes, populating parts of the Andhra coast  en route. Stone images of tirthankara are still turned up by farmers in the  Godavari Delta although today no one remembers Jaina communities.  A stronger Jaina migrant route was down the west coast to Maharastra and  Karnataka. 

In the ninth century, Jaina monks, nuns, and laity were favored by sev eral Rastrakuta kings, including Amoghavarsa who stepped down to become  a monk after a remarkable sixty-eight-year reign. Among those he favored  were residents of Biccolu, now in East Godavari District. Almost a century  later, another Rastrakuta king was Indra IV who underwent the sallekhana fast  to death in Sravanabelgola in 982.9 Some Eastern Calukyas were also royal  patrons. As a religion of non-violence and self-denial the Jaina faith would  appear to be an unlikely choice of warring kings. Kharavela, the permanently  warring ruler of Orissa in the first century bce, was a Jaina. Paul Dundas  perceives “images of striving, battle, and conquest” as appealing to the south  Indian martial society, the spiritually victorious monk being a model equal to  that of the warrior.10 

Periods of interfaith civility alternated with intense deadly conflicts with  other religious communities, militant Saivas in particular. Hindu revivalist  devotional movements and the early twelfth-century reforms of Ramanuja  effectively limited Jaina influence through the medieval period. Ramanuja’s  dissatisfaction with Sankara’s rigid monism, the equation of atman and brah 

man, coupled with his personal experience of Visnu, led him to generate a  Vedanta of “qualified non-dualism” (Visistadvaita) and his teachings spread  throughout the Deccan via new religious centers like those of Sankara four  centuries before him.
