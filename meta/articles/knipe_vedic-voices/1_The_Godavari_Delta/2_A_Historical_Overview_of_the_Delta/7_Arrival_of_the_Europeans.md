Greek and Roman merchant ships in the last centuries bce and early centuries  CE most certainly viewed and perhaps explored the Krishna and Godavari del tas along the Coromandal coast. European colonization of the subcontinent,  however, did not begin until well after Vasco da Gama landed four ships at  Calicut on the Kerala coast in 1498. The early arriving Portuguese concen trated on India’s Arabian Sea coast. A century later the east coast on the Bay of  Bengal was the target of Dutch, Danish, and French traders as well as the even tually all-encompassing English.22 Dutch merchant ships dominated trade in  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries but the English slowly caught up  and then surpassed them. In the seventeenth century the English East India  Company established from modest origins three seaports, Madras, Bombay,  and Calcutta, each to become one of the famous megalopolises of modern  India, Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata, respectively.

The Godavari Delta 17 

A visit today to the coastal town of Machilipatnam, barely thirty-eight miles  from the mouth of the Vasistha-Godavari and close to the northern mouth of  the Krishna Delta, reveals little of its fame more than four centuries ago as  Masulipatam, the busiest and wealthiest seaport on the eastern seaboard.23 

It was the site of a Dutch weaving center established in 1606 by the VOC,  Vereenigde Oost-Indische Comagnie, the United East India Company. English  traders were not slow in recognizing the value of the remarkable textiles and  organized Weaver-caste families five years later. Danish merchants, having  settled farther south on the Coromandal coast at Tranquebar in 1620, became  in 1625 the third European nation to focus on Masulipatam.24 

Many Weaver families in the Godavari Delta contributed their specialty in  calicoes with designs penned onto the cloth with vegetable dyes in the tech nique of kalam-kari. A Dutch census in 1680 accounted for eighteen weaving  centers near Draksarama alone. Villages with 40 to 900 Weaver families each  had an average 418 looms per village,25 an incredibly energetic homespun  industry for Godavari weavers in the seventeenth century. It meant then, as  it does today, employment of every able member of the household. English  entrepreneurs eventually followed the Dutch deeper into the Godavari Delta  to Jagannathapuram. In addition to the main attraction, calicoes, exports  included raw silk, yarn, and printed cloth, diamonds, sapphires, and rubies  from Golconda and other mines, as well as cotton, sugar, teak, and even  slaves. These brought fortunes of staggering size to European merchants,  one diamond merchant in London, for example, profiting 100,000 pounds  in the year 1676.26 By 1680, however, Madras had emerged from its sleepy  1639 origins as Fort St. George to rival Masulipatam as the east coast port of  choice.27 Given over to the British by the Dutch in 1825 was another famous  Coromandal port, Pulicat, in use as early as the third century bce by the Cola  and Pallava kingdoms. 

The French also settled along the Coromandal coast, their equivalent of the  East India Companies of the Dutch, English, and Danes being La Compagnie  Francaise des Indes Orientales. Their 1674 colony at Pondicherry obtained  from the Dutch additional ports at Karikal and Yanam (Yanaon), the latter  in the Godavari Delta on the northern branch of the Gautami-Godavari, a  deep-water shelter not far from the sea. Yanam, French from 1731 until it was  turned over to India in 1954, was something of a back door into the lucra 

tive textile and diamond exports. A visit in the 1980s seeking some lingering  expertise in the making of wine and bread disclosed that the old customs bor der between India and “France” was still evident, but only a walled cemetery,  the village toilet, spoke of a former Gallic presence.

By 1736, English East India Company ships eliminated French traders from  the Coromandal coast, although Pondicherry, Karikal, and Yanam remained  French territory until 1945. The English East India Company had won the  day, and from the remainder of the eighteenth century until formation of the  Republic of India in 1947 the Godavari Delta was in the Madras Presidency  (established in 1653)28 where it had been situated in 1768. By 1800, all access  to roads and property in the Presidency was governed by the Company.29 

After the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, for which the House of Commons blamed  Company mismanagement, 1858 witnessed a transition from Company rule  to the British Raj.
