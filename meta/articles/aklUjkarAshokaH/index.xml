      <description>&lt;p&gt;Veda Revelation according to Bhartr-hari&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the present paper,* I approach Veda revelation principally as a phenomenon or experience, more for the logic of its assumption and conception than for the details of what it reveals. The paper thus supplements Aklujkar 199la summarized in appendix 1 with some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very short version of this paper was presented on 30 March 1992 at the 202nd meeting of the American Oriental Society held at Cambridge, Massachusetts. It discussed only the TKV passages 1 and 2 specified below in their philological relationship with Nirukta 1.20. It was given the present extended form over the intervening years. My extraordinarily learned friend Professor Albrecht Wezler kindly referred to one such extended form in an article of his published in 2001. That form has undergone many changes in the present version. If any incongruence is noticed between the present version and what Wezler attributes to me in his 2001 article, the attribution in Wezler&amp;rsquo;s article should be set aside, without any implication of error on his part; my view should be thought of as changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
