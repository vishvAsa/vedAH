  <meta property="og:description" content="The Atharvaveda is in some respects similar to the Rigveda. About one-seventh of its verses are the same or more or less the same. The collection reflects a different social background. Instead of poets, singers or priests, we meet with physicians and magicians who use drugs and spells to cure diseases, mental as well as physical. The Atharvaveda exists in two recensions, each containing almost 6,000 verses.
It is clear from the earliest compositions that they were the prized possessions of small tribal groups, families or clans, hunter-gatherers and pastoralists who avoided the forests and followed the course of rivers before they settled down. The geography of the Vedas may be largely reconstructed from the names of these rivers. They are shown on the map in Figure 1 (see end of book) which is reproduced from Michael Witzel’s 1989 study on Vedic dialects. The reader will recognize most rivers: Sindhu is, of course, the Indus after which India has been named. Kubhā and Suvāstu are the Kabul and Swat Rivers, Vitastā the Jhelum, Asiknī the Chenab, Paruṣṇī the Ravi, Śutudrī the Sutlej and others should speak for themselves as does Himavant, the Himalayan range.">

  <p>The Atharvaveda is in some respects similar to the Rigveda. About one-seventh of its verses are the same or more or less the same. The collection reflects a different social background. Instead of poets, singers or priests, we meet with physicians and magicians who use drugs and spells to cure diseases, mental as well as physical. The Atharvaveda exists in two recensions, each containing almost 6,000 verses.</p>
<p>It is clear from the earliest compositions that they were the prized possessions of small tribal groups, families or clans, hunter-gatherers and pastoralists who avoided the forests and followed the course of rivers before they settled down. The geography of the Vedas may be largely reconstructed from the names of these rivers. They are shown on the map in Figure 1 (see end of book) which is reproduced from Michael Witzel’s 1989 study on Vedic dialects. The reader will recognize most rivers: <em>Sindhu</em> is, of course, the Indus after which India has been named. <em>Kubhā</em> and <em>Suvāstu</em> are the Kabul and Swat Rivers, <em>Vitastā</em> the Jhelum, <em>Asikn</em>ī the Chenab, <em>Paru</em>ṣṇī the Ravi, Ś<em>utudr</em>ī the Sutlej and others should speak for themselves as does <em>Himavant</em>, the Himalayan range.</p>
<p>The Vedas often mention the names of tribes. Figure 2 depicts another map from Witzel, based upon these data which identifies the region of the Rigveda, the white area to the west (north and west of the ‘desert tribes’), not including any part of Rajasthan or Gujarat. This area contrasts with a large dotted area to the east which marks the places of origin of the bulk of compositions that make up the other three Vedas. Names of tribes often correspond to Vedic ‘schools’ to which we return at the end of Chapter 4.</p>
<p>We now know something definite, we know where the Vedas were composed, that the Rigveda is the earliest because it is presupposed by the others and we have an inkling of their relative chronology. What about absolute dates?</p>
<h2 id="the-rigveda-and-the-indus-civilization">The Rigveda and the Indus Civilization</h2>
<p>Extraordinary claims have been made and are being made with regard to the dates of origin of the Vedas. In the past, such claims were difficult to evaluate because little was known about the Vedic language or prehistory of India. I shall have more to say about language, but the latter deficiency was made good by the discovery of the Harappan or Indus Civilization. It turned out to be the third major early culture of humankind after Egypt and Mesopotamia. By ‘early’ I mean that the Early Harappan or pre-Harappan civilization started in the late fourth millennium BCE, more than five thousand years ago. Were the Vedic Indians perhaps inhabitants of those famous brick-built cities, Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, or some of the numerous other sites that have been excavated? It seems unlikely because the Rigveda does not refer to towns and does not even have a word for ‘brick’. It refers to forts with mud walls and later Vedas mention ruins. And yet, the Rigveda is not oblivious to its surroundings.</p>
<p>The names of many rivers and their tributaries are mentioned as we have just seen. It gave to some Indic rivers the names of streams in Afghanistan which the poets or their ancestors had known before. In that respect the rivers resemble New York, which my ancestors had already called New Amsterdam before the British name prevailed. A much discussed example is a river called <em>Harax’aitî</em>, now in Afghanistan where it is called Helmand. The Rigveda gave that same name to a river in the Punjab: <em>Sarasvat</em>ī in Vedic. <em>Harax’aitî</em> or <em>Sarasvat</em>ī means ‘provided with ponds.’ The river ended in the desert, a fact attested by Vedic sources as we shall see in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>Relevant in the present context is another fact of geography: the areas of the Indus Civilization and of the early Vedas overlap in part: they overlap in the Indus Valley as Figures 1 and 2 clearly show. We should, therefore, be more precise about the geography of the Indus or Harappa Civilization as well. Figure 3 depicts a map of its final period, ca. 2100 to 1600 BCE. As we see at a glance, Late Harappan included Sind and Gujarat which were not known to the Rigveda.</p>
<p>Our map comes from a reputable source—Joseph Schwartzberg’s <em>Historical Atlas of South Asia</em>—but does not shy away from injecting civilization into geography by pictures of stone-blades, pottery and a ‘Mother’ Goddess who might be a queen or an otherwise distinguished woman. Why does it not include the famous Harappan clay seals with their even more famous inscriptions? Schwartzberg devotes two sentences to them in the extensive account of the Indus or Harappa Civilization that follows his maps after 146 pages. There he writes that many attempts have been made to read the script, but ‘none of the putative decipherments has been generally accepted. There is, however, agreement, that the script is ideosyllabic, and the currently preferred working hypothesis is that it represents an early Dravidian language.’</p>
<p>Evasive caution or wise words? As a matter of fact, starting in 1877, over a hundred claimed decipherments of the ‘Indus Script’ have made it into print. I have seen only a few but must confess, that I have always been convinced that these symbols have nothing to do with writing. However, this is not my field and I did not enter the fray. As a boy, I had dabbled in Egyptian hieroglyphs. I was familiar with the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and its decipherment by Champollion. I knew that prior to that famous event, there had been hundreds of ‘putative decipherments’. But once the key was found, everything clicked and fell into place. Nothing was heard of the early theories again. Scientists may be stubborn and stupid, but everyone accepts a theory that explains and makes sense of <em>everything</em>. That is what we have with regard to hieroglyphs and lack with regard to Harappa.</p>
<p>What these symbols are and what they are not has been stated only recently in clearer terms. Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat and Michael Witzel explain the main reason why these scribbles cannot be a script: they are too short. The four to five thousand inscriptions that are now known occur on a variety of materials but mostly on clay. The longest consists of seventeen symbols and less than a hundred have as many as ten. The average length of the 2,905 objects listed in I. Mahadevan’s standard concordance of 1977 is 4.6 signs. No known written language consists of inscriptions that are that short.</p>
<p>Short symbolic expressions exist, but they are markings of a different sort. Many are known from early civilizations. Those from the Near East are similar to the Harappan and have been studied in great detail. They link families, clans, offices, places, professions or festivals to deities or other celestial or mythological figures. Their purposes may be magical, but governments can make use of them for tax purposes. To associate such functions with the Indus seals would be consistent with many of the pictorial representations of deities, celestial beings and mythological figures found on the seals.</p>
<p>Romila Thapar summarizes: ‘They could have been tokens identifying civic authorities, supervisory managers of long-distance trade, merchants or those bringing raw materials to the cities, or clan affiliations.’</p>
<p>I conclude that the Harappa ‘script’ does not exist and cannot therefore assist us in dating the Vedas. We know that the Harappa Civilization and the Rigveda overlapped in space. Since everything else seems to be different—a feature to which I return—they cannot have overlapped in time. I conclude that the Rigveda must be older than the late fourth millennium or later than, say, 1800 BCE. Why not both?</p>
<p>It is here that we come face to face with a basic feature of human evolution: it includes language because languages evolve. Just as mammals came after saurians and birds after fish, Hindi or Marathi came after Sanskrit and French or Italian after Latin. The Vedic language itself changed within the Rigveda and between the Rig- and Yajurvedas. The Late Vedic of the Upaniṣads, the language of Yājñavalkya, has evolved further: it is close to classical Sanskrit. It is out of the question that the language of the Rigveda, then a living language, was the same during the fourth and second millennia BCE.</p>
<h2 id="mitanni-vedic-and-indic-genetics">Mitanni Vedic and Indic Genetics</h2>
<p>As it happens, the question does not arise because we are fortunate in possessing precise chronological evidence that throws light on the matter and is as astonishing as it is conclusive. It has been known for about a century, albeit to a handful of specialists, that three Vedic gods, Indra, Mitra and Varuṇa, are referred to in a treaty between a Hittite king, who ruled over a large part of Asia Minor or what is now Turkey, and a king from Mitanni, an equally large empire in what is now Syria and northern Iraq. The Hittite king spoke Hittite, an Indo-European language, and the Mitanni king was a speaker of Vedic or a language very close to Vedic that has been called Mitanni Vedic. That remarkable piece of information is recorded on a cuneiform clay tablet dating from about 1380 BC.</p>
<p>Other tablets of the same period mention Vedic numerals and terms that refer to the training of horses and the construction of chariots. Kikkuli, a Mitanni expert whose language was also identical with or extremely close to Vedic, knew a great deal about how to tame, rear, yoke and harness horses, their temperament and colours—an important and entirely new technology. He wrote a treatise on these topics, which was transliterated into the cuneiform script that was used for Hittite. Two ‘pages’ are illustrated in Figure 4. It is a syllabic script that gives us a good idea of the way Kikkuli pronounced his words:</p>

<p>Kikkuli’s treatise explains the essentials of his training programme. It prepared horses for the drawing of chariots that were used for hunting or ceremonial purposes but primarily for fighting in battle. The horses were made to run distances three times a year: during winter, autumn and spring. It involved various courses at the end of which a turn (<em>vartana</em>) had to be made. All the Mitanni transliterations are very close to Vedic words with the exception of the numeral for ‘one’ that appears as ‘<em>a-i-ka</em>’. Vedic has <em>eka</em> but ‘<em>a-i-ka</em>’ confirms the older form of the numeral ‘one’ that linguists had postulated for proto-Vedic. It is not found in Iranian, the language of ancient Iran, which is closely related to Vedic but has <em>aiva</em>. These correspondences show that the few Vedic Indians who moved west did so at an early period, probably just before the stage of development of the Vedic language with which we are familiar. It suggests that there was a linguistic development from an earlier language which split into two: Iranian developed <em>aiva</em> and Vedic <em>aika</em> which turned into <em>eka.</em> It also shows that Vedic, which was later located <em>east</em> of Iranian, is more closely related to the language of Kikkuli which was located to the <em>west</em>. It is an apparent paradox but there is a perfect explanation at which we shall arrive when we will discuss the relationships between Vedic and the Iranian Wedge.</p>
<p>The close connections between the language of the Rigveda and that of Kikkuli’s treatise solve an important historical problem but that need not be the end of the story. Science is never final and new evidence accumulates all the time from other lost Southwest Asian languages such as Kassite, Hurrian, Luwian and Emar; and also from Austro-Asiatic, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and other language families that left traces in Vedic as we shall see. But whatever happens, and whatever their itineraries, to which we shall return as well, the recorded dates of these Vedic names and words are firm and establish beyond doubt that the Vedas cannot be earlier than the Indus Civilization but must be later.</p>
<p>This conclusion pertains not only to history but sheds light on society. Kikkuli’s treatise was obviously regarded as a valuable document that transmitted practical knowledge from a distant civilization. It carried prestige and may help to explain that some speakers of Mitanni Vedic became rulers of the Mitanni Empire during its formative period. Something similar happened in India on a smaller scale: speakers of Vedic became chieftains of Indian clans and these chieftains learned to speak Vedic through close associations that were, centuries later, referred to as <em>brāhmaṇa/kṣatriya</em> alliances.</p>
<p>At this point of our story we have to record another astonishing fact that comes from a very different source. The circumstance that Kikkuli was a single informant or one of very few is in unexpected accordance with the most recent information on the genetic composition of the population of the subcontinent of South Asia. The first genetic research findings were interpreted as supporting the traditional theories of extensive movements or ‘invasions’ by peoples from Central Asia into the subcontinent. Much more careful recent investigations by Denise R. Carvalho Silva, S. Sengupta, C. Tyler-Smith and many others have shown that the genetic origins of the large majority of present-day Indics go back some 9,000 years during which period they have continued to live within the subcontinent. These indigenous lineages remained widespread in both tribal and caste populations. Those who entered from elsewhere during the first half of the second millennium BCE cannot have contributed more than a few Y-chromosomal lineages. This is consistent with the facts about Mitanni Vedic: new knowledge and even a new language may be introduced by very few people, provided there is a powerful incentive. What were the incentives and major differences at the receiving end between the ancient Near East and the subcontinent of South Asia?</p>
<p>The Near East counted many early civilizations that were embodied and transmitted in <em>written</em> form. Suppose a Mitanni Vedic poet had composed Vedic verse in such a situation, it would be done orally and transmitted orally as a matter of course. It would be an ephemeral event amidst powerful scriptural traditions, soon forgotten without leaving a trace behind. The Vedas would in any case not have much future with the eventual emergence of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the three ‘religions of the book’ as the Qur’ān calls them, that are intolerant even of each other.</p>
<p>The Indus Civilization was different. Roughly as old as its Near Eastern cousins, it left no script or scriptural tradition behind. It was weakened and exhausted by the time the first so-called ‘family books’ of what was later called the Rigveda appeared on the scene. Of course, these ‘books’ were not <em>books</em>. They were oral compositions, later assigned to ‘circles’ (<em>maṇḍala</em>). They would not have attracted anyone’s attention had not the Indus Civilization left a large gap into which anything could fall and disappear. Thus was Vedic added to many Indian languages already spoken—but it did not disappear. On the contrary, its impact deepened and the seeds were sown to produce what with hindsight we have come to regard as ‘Vedic civilization’, a new <em>Oral Tradition</em>.</p>
<p>What I have just sketched is no more than a nutshell account of the import of horses and chariots along with the appearance of another language on Indian soil. It does not explain the success of the Vedas in India. But I have not yet mentioned a different, perhaps unique and decisive factor. It became apparent that the few families and groups that trickled across the mountains possessed a mysterious power different from that of language: the power of mantra. That power was attributed to their seers who were also their poets and sages. Vedic mantra power was different from the ‘spiritual’ power assigned to them by fashionable modern, postmodern and post-postmodern constructions. It also has better credentials. One of the ancient hymns of a family circle (RV=Rigveda 7.33) speaks about the credentials of Sage Vasiṣṭha, the ‘Most Excellent’. Fathered by two gods, Mitra and Varuṇa, he was born not from the womb but from the mind of a nymph named Urvaśī, ‘Widely Extending’ like Dawn. In due course, Vasiṣṭha became the domestic priest of King Sudās who was the victor in the War of the Ten Kings (<em>dāśarājña</em>), a struggle between tribal chieftains who spoke different languages. Sudās’s victory was due to Indra’s intervention, which was in turn based upon Vasiṣṭha invocation with mantra power. In its first pangs of birth, the Rigveda already has many such stories.</p>
<p>The power of mantras is a large topic. Not yet understood, I believe, it must be left for further discussion in later chapters. It certainly played a major part in the multiple processes of reciprocal acculturation between indigenous lineages and those few speakers of Indo-European who had entered from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even without including mantras, our brief sketch gives short shrift to a ridiculous idea of long standing: the supposition of large numbers of people invading the subcontinent with their fighting chariots and horses, crossing the high mountains that shield India from the rest of Asia. That supposition is correct in one respect: there is no doubt that horses were introduced from elsewhere. They are not found or depicted in the Indus Civilization. Their earliest traces in South Asia come from Pirak, southeast of the Bolan Pass, and date from the seventeenth century BCE as we shall see in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Horses have always been rare in India. They do not thrive on Indian soil and the climate does not smile on them. But they are rampant in the Vedas. In the Rigveda, I counted 792 occurrences of the word <em>aśva</em> in various forms. The word for chariot, <em>ratha</em>, is equally common; but there was no need for chariots to be carried across mountains. It was the <em>idea</em> of the chariot and the precise knowledge of how to construct one that were transmitted across the mountains by a handful of experts. That knowledge was enough.</p>
<p>Transmitting the idea of the chariot may be a peculiar feature within the much wider perspective in which our topic must be placed. Light horse chariots with spoked wheels replaced traditional carts with solid wheels, pulled by oxen, not only in the Near East and South Asia, but also in southern Europe and other parts of Eurasia. It happened in most of these places during the first half of the second millennium BCE; in China slightly later. What may set the Indus Valley apart from these other areas is that such chariots were imported there by a small number of people <em>through their minds</em>.</p>
<p>What about actual numbers of people? The population of the lower town at Mohenjo-daro, more dense than the citadel, has been estimated at 42,000 or more. That of the entire subcontinent at the middle of the first millennium BCE has been put at around twenty million. Let us assume that the population of all of ‘Vedic India’ (that is, not only speakers of Indo-European) as depicted on the map of Figure 2, more than half a millennium earlier, was around half a million or 500,000. Assume that half of those were tribes: 250,000. The map mentions fourteen tribes mentioned in the Vedas. Assume there were fifty in all, that is 5,000 people per tribe <em>on an average</em>. But that number is far too large for our hunter-gatherers and pastoralists at any given time. They may have moved over the same terrain, but came trickling in over many centuries. Conclusion: We know far too little to make reliable guesses about numbers but they must have been small.</p>
<p>These tribals did not invade or conquer, as has long been assumed. They mingled and settled with others already there. There were battles as well as alliances, the latter between tribes as well as persons. There was the exchange of information, some of it of a specialized nature. We shall study one case at the beginning of Part II: that of the <em>Rathakāra</em> or ‘chariot-maker’. He had not crossed the high passes on a chariot and did not arrive on a chariot: but he <em>knew</em> how to make chariots with spoked wheels just as the Mitanni experts knew how to train horses. Over time, both acquired high social status and lived in palaces. What did the indigenous tribes and later settled populations contribute? Mantras of their own, chants, rituals, sciences, insights, structures and patterns of thought—the bulk of what we find in the Vedas and shall study in this book.</p>
<p>In the remaining sections of Part I, we shall try to explain what happened before and why it happened. If we exclude the chants of the Sāmaveda to which we return in Chapter 6, we know nothing of pre-Vedic oral traditions on the subcontinent, e.g., of the Harappans. There might not have been any connections with the Vedic oral tradition in any case. But with regard to language and other specific matters, including Agni and Soma, much is known about Vedic origins and backgrounds from outside the subcontinent.</p>
<p>Some scholars have stressed outside influences. Others have de-emphasized them. We should always remember that in any process of acculturation both sides have to be taken into account. This leads us to an answer for a contemporary problem.</p>
<p>The United Nations has recently issued a 96-page report on international migration that calls for ‘the immediate establishment of a high-level-inter-institutional group to define the functions and modalities of, and pave the way for, an Inter-agency Global Migration Facility.’ Such an inter-agency might learn from the Vedic experience if it would be willing to accept—but for political reasons will not—that immigration is successful when both sides have something to offer, try hard to understand what makes the other side tick and establish close personal alliances. The latter includes not only marriages, but what in South Asia is sometimes called <em>sambandham</em> or ‘relationship’. The status of a person, who is about to be born from an inter-tribal alliance, may depend on complex rules that vary from tribe to tribe. We know little about such matters during Vedic times until we come closer to the end of the Vedic period.</p>
<h2 id="geography-and-indo-european">Geography and Indo-European</h2>
<p>In recent years, Indian politicians and expatriate engineers have claimed that everything Vedic hails from India. It is true that the Vedas were largely <em>composed</em> in what are now India and Pakistan, but it does not follow that all the ideas, composers and their ancestors came from there—just as all of Spinoza’s philosophy does not come from Holland though he found comfortable settings and published his books there.</p>
<p>The opposite theory, that everything Vedic comes from outside India is equally absurd. Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s famous assignment of the Vedas to an ‘Arctic Home’ has never been demonstrated. We have to look carefully at each feature about which a claim is made that it hails from elsewhere. Do these claims hang together? We need precise and exact answers, and to specify the geography, the paths taken, the chronology—in other words we must arrive at a consistent picture of development in which everything fits.</p>
<p>Most traditional theories of large-scale invasions have regarded Central Asia as their area of origin. None of the evidence presently known is consistent with the hypothesis of invasions, but all of it continues to point to that region, taken in its widest extension. So let us start with language.</p>
<p>Readers may have noted that Kikkuli numerals <em>tri</em> and <em>sapta</em> look like English <em>three</em> and <em>seven</em> or resemble the names for ‘3’ and ‘7’ in other Indic or European languages. We need not confine ourselves to numerals. The relevant linguistic evidence goes beyond names and words. The language of the Rigveda has a definite structure that belongs to a particular family of languages which has been called Indo-Aryan. The other three Vedas exhibit that same language family at later stages of its development.</p>
<p>Indo-Aryan is a subfamily of the large family of Indo-European (IE) languages. Their relatedness was discovered by Sir William Jones, founder of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In a famous lecture in 1786, Jones defended the thesis that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and several other languages were related. He did not invoke vague analogies but ‘a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed that no philologer could examine them’ (that is, the languages) ‘without believing them to have sprung from a common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.’</p>
<p>Although ‘one common source’ may be a simplification, two centuries of research and a large accumulation of facts have confirmed Jones’s hypothesis. Relationships between words are illustrated by basic parts of the vocabulary: numerals as we have seen (<em>sapta</em> is related not only to English <em>seven</em> but to Greek <em>hepta</em> and Latin <em>septem</em> from which we have <em>September</em>); body parts (<em>pada</em>, <em>pedon</em>, <em>pedis</em>, <em>foot</em>); common verbs (<em>asti</em>, <em>esti</em>, <em>est, is</em>); conjugations and declensions (Sanskrit <em>agnis</em>, <em>agnim</em>, <em>agnibhyas</em>, Latin <em>ignis</em>, <em>ignem</em>, <em>ignibus</em>). Syntax is illustrated by Rigveda 1.32.1: <em>indrasya nu vīryāṇi pravocam</em> is similar in structure to <em>of Indra I shall now proclaim the heroic deeds</em> and means the same. The <em>nu</em> is the same as Greek, Old Irish, Lithuanian and Old English <em>nu</em>, modern English <em>now</em>. Indra’s <em>vīryāṇi</em> are English <em>virile</em> deeds from Latin <em>vir</em>, ‘man’. <em>Pra vocam</em>, ‘proclaim’, literally ‘speak forth’, is related to Latin <em>pro</em> ‘forth’ and <em>voco</em> ‘I call’. English <em>provoke</em> has the same form though the meaning has become different. <em>Pro</em> is common in Greek, Latin, French, English <em>produce</em>, <em>protect</em>, <em>provide</em>, etc. <em>Vāc</em> and <em>voc</em>—correspond to Latin <em>vox</em>, French <em>voix</em>, English <em>voice</em>, <em>vocal</em>, <em>vociferous</em>, etc. Thousands of such facts and the sound laws that relate them to each other determine the place of Indo-Aryan within Indo-European (IE).</p>
<p>There is an intermediate stage between the two language groups: Indo-Iranian, one of several subfamilies into which IE split. Indo-Iranian itself split in due course into Iranian and Indo-Aryan. I shall concentrate on Indo-Aryan, the language of the Vedas, but continue to refer to Iranian on a few significant occasions:</p>

<h2 id="the-iranian-wedge-and-the-bmac">The Iranian Wedge and the BMAC</h2>
<p>What are the paths the words, phrases and structures of these languages could have taken through history and geography? The map of Figure 5 presents us with a number of facts, some we have discussed and others we are about to explore. The two thick arrows explain the paths that Mitanni and Indic Vedic followed. The treks may have been followed by few people, but the arrows are thick with ideas. What explains their bifurcation? It is widely accepted that this is due to a powerful <em>Iranian Wedge</em> which came from the north and pushed them in opposite directions. That happened somewhere in the area labelled on the map as ‘BM’. That label is based upon the name <em>BMAC</em> which refers to another recent discovery: a highly developed urban civilization on the Oxus river. I shall discuss it first because it provides some facts that explain the Iranian Wedge.</p>
<p>The BMAC or ‘Bactrian-Margiana Archeological Complex’ was discovered during recent decades of archaeological excavation and research in Russia and the Central Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union. Large fortified and walled structures from kiln-fired bricks were unearthed and reconstructed (see Figure 6). The dates of the mature phase of that civilization are 2100–1900 BCE. Such dates are close to what we would expect if we were looking for influences on early Vedic. No inscriptions or texts have been found but that is not surprising: why should the BMAC people at that early period have arrived at a system of writing when the earlier Indus Civilization with its kiln-fired bricks, from which the BMAC certainly derived theirs, did not have a system of writing either?</p>
<p>At this point, closer inspection of the language of the Vedas extends a helpful hand. About 300 words that occur in the Rigveda are not Indo-Aryan or Indo-European but come from elsewhere. Many come from Munda, a group of languages still spoken in parts of India, or proto-Munda. It accounts for words starting with <em>ka-</em> (e.g., <em>kapardin</em>, ‘with hair-knot’), <em>ku-</em> (e.g., well-known <em>kumāra</em> and <em>kumār</em>ī), or <em>ki-</em> (especially tribal names such as <em>Kīkaṭa</em>). Munda belongs to the large group of Austro-Asiatic languages that include Khmer, Mon, Vietnamese and seventy-five others in South-east Asia.</p>
<p>Dravidian words in the Veda, which become more frequent later, include <em>nīr</em>, ‘water,’ <em>mleccha</em>, ‘foreigner’ and perhaps <em>vrīhi</em>, ‘rice’, though a Munda origin was proposed by Suniti Kumar Chatterji. Other Vedic words come from Tibeto-Burman or isolated languages, still spoken by small groups of people in the Himalayas or Central India. The process of mutual influences and interpenetration continued. Madhav Deshpande has shown how such contacts and convergences caused a gap to develop between the spoken Indo-Aryan dialects, living and constantly changing, and the language of the oral tradition of the Vedas which was more or less fixed.</p>
<p>A clearly identifiable group of non-Indo-European words belongs to a lost language that must have been spoken in Central Asia because it includes words for camel, donkey, panther, hemp and mustard. Some speakers of Indo-Aryan must have trekked through this area or through regions under its influence. Space and time suggest that it is the lost language of the BMAC, which linguists have begun to reconstruct, and is non-Indo-European as is obvious from its linguistic structure and supported by its semantics. It left traces in the Vedas and in Vedic ritual.</p>
<p>But how does one reconstruct a lost language? It is like asking, how does one reconstruct a dinosaur? We have to put pieces together with great care. Some may come from, or have moved, elsewhere. An interesting BMAC word is the term for ‘brick’ that was missing from the Rigveda. The Yajurveda has such a word: <em>iṣṭakā</em>. It refers to kiln-fired bricks from which large Vedic fire altars were constructed. It looks like Sanskrit and there is a cognate in Iranian, but its structure is not Indo-European and it does not occur in any other IE language. Its formation resembles that of the other words from the BMAC that have been grouped together. Some return in the Sāmaveda. They are like a jawbone missing from an excavated skull but found on the other side of a rock. It is not easy to put a skeleton together. Everything must fit, including the dates.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to explain what the map further depicts and implies. Speakers of Indo-Aryan came from the north and picked up some BMAC words. Some of these were passed from Indo-Aryan to Iranian as A. Lubotsky has shown. That explains the Iranian Wedge which forced Indo-Aryan to go in two opposite directions: west to the Near East and east to India. It explains at the same time the remarkable fact we met with before: West Asian Vedic is more closely related to Indian Vedic than to Iranian for the simple reason that they were one before Iranian came and pushed them away from each other in opposite directions: the Iranian Wedge.</p>
<h2 id="the-tarim-mummies">The Tarim Mummies</h2>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle comes from another story so far unrelated to the others: that of the ‘Tarim Mummies of Xinjiang’. Not as recent, but as topical as its oil boom status, both stories have paved the way for the fame of the Uighur Autonomous Region. But the mummies require a wider perspective.</p>
<p>Prior to the BMAC excavations of the previous section, archaeological research in Russia and the Central Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union had made it increasingly likely that the traditional theory of the Eurasian steppes being the original home of speakers of Indo-European was correct. But there was no proof. The elements were at hand, but they came from further east, a region unknown to most students of Indo-European, where Chinese and Uighur archaeologists had since the late 1970s exhumed scores of desiccated corpses and hundreds of skeletons in the dry regions of the Yarkand–Tarim Basin of Xinjiang. Their most noteworthy feature demonstrated in the 1990s, through DNA analysis, is that they belonged to Europoid or Caucasian peoples who are elsewhere known to have spoken Indo-European. The earliest of these Tarim mummies date from approximately 2000 BCE and the latest from the second or third century CE. The early dates fit our context like a glove.</p>
<p>They do not fit the prevailing hypothesis about the language of the mummies. All authors of publications I have been able to consult (many of them articles edited by Viktor Mair) have unquestionably assumed that Tocharian, an extinct and isolated Indo-European language, was the language of the mummies. This is a far-fetched and unlikely assumption since the only dates of Tocharian that have been attested come from Buddhist manuscripts found in the northern part of the Tarim Basin and dating from the sixth and seventh centuries CE. That is roughly two-and-a-half millennia too late for us. The ‘T’ on the map of Figure 5, therefore, does not refer to late Tocharian but to ‘Tarim’, <em>tout court</em>.</p>
<p>There are many arguments to show that Tocharian was an ancient Indo-European language. But the languages it resembles most closely are early languages spoken in Europe such as Celtic, Italic (which is older than Latin) and Prehellenic (which is older than Greek). It must have branched out to the Tarim Basin at some date or other, but during that extended period of almost three millennia, its speakers could have moved, settled or disappeared almost anywhere in Eurasia or even in Alaska or California without leaving a trace behind. How many people become mummies that are preserved and discovered because the region is so excessively dry? What then was the language of these mummies before they were mummies?</p>
<p>If we put the facts together, it becomes clear what happened around 2000 BCE. Speakers of Indo-Iranian were roaming the steppes south of the Ural Mountains, northeast of the Caspian Sea. All went in southern directions but the south-west was blocked by the Caspian Sea. Some went due South and ended up speaking Iranian. We shall return to them in a moment. Others went in the south-eastern direction through what is now Kazakhstan and entered the Tarim Basin. They went the only way one could go: passing through the famous gateway of the Tien Shan mountain range known as the Dzungarian Gates. It is located between what are now called Tashkent on the west and Kashgar on the east. More than two millennia later, Chinese Buddhist pilgrims went through those same gates in the opposite direction to Tashkent and Samarkand, a city with which Xuanzang (Hiuan-tsang), having crossed the deserts and despite his monastic status, fell in love. He was a great scholar about whom we shall learn more towards the end of this book.</p>
<p>Moving in the opposite direction, our speakers of Indo-Iranian may have had different feelings when they entered the desiccated Tarim Basin where some of them became mummies and where not only their bodies and tattooed skins, but their clothes survived in excellent condition. Colour illustrations would be needed. Some mummies wear knee-high socks of matted wool fibres in the rainbow colors of the gay flag.</p>
<p>Tarim mummies have been found in two areas, north and south of the Taklamakan Desert, subsequently the northern and southern Silk Roads. In the north, most discoveries come from the eastern end, close to China proper. Along the southern branch, a series of finds, going from east to west, leads to Khotan, close to the source of the Yarkand–Tarim Rivers, the Pamir Ridge where Muztagh Ata towers at 24,757 feet. It is a colossal mountain and it was a long trek to get there through the deserts. It is not surprising that the Indo-Iranian language of the speakers had changed by the time it got there. It had become what is now called Indo-Aryan. It was then and has always remained the easternmost Indo-European and Indo-Iranian language.</p>
<p>The conclusion at which we are arriving is confirmed by Rigvedic information about the Soma, a rare hallucinogenic plant that grew in the high mountains and to which we return in Chapters 5 and 7 and more often. The best Soma comes from Mount Mūjavat which means ‘the Mountain that possesses <em>Mūj</em>’. It reminds us of the name of the colossus Muztagh Ata which means ‘Father of <em>Muz</em> Mountain’. <em>Mūj</em> and <em>Muz</em> are both unexplained but Witzel related them to each other and identified the two mountains accordingly. It implies that speakers of Indo-Aryan, who passed through the Pamirs on their way from the Tarim Basin to what is now Afghanistan, picked up the original Soma there. Witzel’s hypothesis is consistent with my emerging conclusion.</p>
<p>So far I have concentrated on the slow development of Indo-Iranian into Indo-Aryan but what happened to those who became speakers of Iranian? They were larger in number and moved more slowly through the steppes and into the deserts. We know that they proceeded from south of the Ural Mountains and that their language eventually changed into the language of the Avesta which includes the Gathas of Zarathustra. It supports the suggestion that they had gone due south, before acting as a wedge, receiving some BMAC words from the Indo-Aryans and ending up in Greater Iran.</p>
<p>That those who became speakers of Iranian went due south is demonstrated by another and more extraordinary fact. Speakers of Iranian referred to the Vedic <em>soma</em> as <em>haoma</em> but they knew numerous <em>haoma</em>s which grew in common places, even along the roadside. The effects of ingesting those plants were slight. The Rigveda knows only one Soma which grew in the high mountains and was rare. The effects of drinking its juice were described in ecstatic terms as we shall hear in Chapter 5. If speakers of Indo-Aryan discovered Soma when passing through the Pamirs, it follows that the Iranians never went there. Their many <em>haoma</em>s were substitutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what happened to the horse? It does not thrive in the sandy deserts of the Tarim Basin, as Victor Mair has pointed out. It prefers steppes like Mongolia, from where it reached China, and Kazakhstan, from where it reached India. This explains that horses did not go via the Khyber Pass as some speakers of Indo-Aryan did, but went from the BMAC region straight south with other groups, crossed the Bolan Pass and reached Pirak and Kachi, the earliest places in South Asia where traces of horses have been found.</p>
<p>One horse has been found at Gonur in Turkmenistan and much was made of it. According to David Anthony, it was not domesticated there but was a trade item, as Victor Mair explained on the Indology Internet in October 2006.</p>
