      <description>&lt;p&gt;One much neglected thinker probably belonged to the Atharvaveda school of Śaunaka: Kautsa. The name is uncommon but not unknown. An early treatise on phonetics and phonology of the Śaunaka school is sometimes referred to as ‘Kautsa’s Grammar’. It is available in a recent critical edition with translation into English and extensive notes by Madhav Deshpande. The same name is associated with a work that has been lost but that presented a thesis that is well known. It has been much maligned but plays a major role in the history of ideas. In our present context, it occupies a special place: for as I am winding up my account of the four Vedas, we are approaching a more analytical treatment of some of the facts that have been assembled and the author of the thesis combined a vast knowledge of linguistics and mantras with an analytical mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
