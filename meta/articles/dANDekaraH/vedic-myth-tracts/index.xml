      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOME ASPECTS OF THE AGNI-MYTHOLOGY IN THE VEDA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subject of my lectures! is “Some Aspects of the Agol. Mythology in the Veda &amp;quot; Accordingly, my aim, in these lectures, will not be to present any detailed and connected statement about the Agar mythology as a whole, I shall only endeavour to emphasize certain points relating to Agni as he figures in the Vedic mythology and ritual - points, which, I think, do not usually receive sufficient attention of course, while doing so, I shall have to presume, on the part of my listeners, a general acquain tance with the broad outlines of the Agni-mythology&#xA;It is well known that Agni is, Dext to Indra, the most promi. nent of the Vedic gods He is celebrated in at least 200 hymns of the RV, and, in many others, he is invoked conjointly with other divinities On this background, some of the features of the Agni mythology seem rather peculiar Agni is seen to be often isolated from the compact mass of the Vedic gods For instance, he is! regarded as being more earthly than &amp;lsquo;heavenly. He is looked&amp;rsquo; upon mainly as an envoy of gods rather than as a god He is also the hotr or the purohita of the gods, their eye, their mouth, even their animal&amp;rsquo; The gods are said to have employed him for ritual service, and, as a reward for such service, to have bestowed upon him eternal youth. It is also noteworthy that Agai is rarely represented as having a share in Soma with the other gods? The peculiar position of Ago in the Vedic mytho. logy seems to have been alluded to by a Vedic poet when he, very significantly, says of him in RV I 69 2 bluvo devānam pitā putrah san “ You became the father of gods, though their son&amp;quot;&#xA;1 Two lectures delivered at the Oriental Institute, Baroda, under the auspices of the M S University, on March 5-6, 1962&#xA;2 For these and similar references, see MACDONELL, VA1, 88–101. 3. Also cf SPB II 3 3,5&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY&#xA;279&#xA;Another peculiar feature of the Agon-mythology in the Veda is the original dichotomy between the mythological Agni and the sacrificial fire [t have deliberately used the word agni in the mythological context and the word fire in the ritual context 1 Today I propose to begin with a brief consideration of this point&#xA;It is evident that Agni as a Vedic god is to be clearly distin guished from the sacrificial fires, such as, the alaantja, the gārhapalya, and the daksina. These fires are never referred to as deialas Sacrificial oblations are offered on these fires, but never to these fires The aha anıya and the other fires are not to be regarded even as different forms of god Agai In the ritual sütras, we find that oblations are prescribed to be offered to different Agnis, such as, vratapati Agni, amlomuc Ago), anka ant Agni, tantumant Agni, and pathukri Agni ( as many as fifty-six such Agais are mentioned in connection with the seven Hayıryajña samsthās only)but never to the ahavaniya fire, the gårliapatya firc, etc It may be that, as suggested by some scholars, the concept of the three sacrificial fires has been derived from the triple character of the Vedic Agni, namely, as Surya, Váyu or Indra, and Ago! But to identify the three sacrificial fires with certain mythological concepts mentioned in the RV seems to be unwarranted I propose to discuss, at some length, one such identification.&#xA;HILLEBRANDT believes that Narāśamsa is the Rgvedic name for the dahsına fire of the later vtual He thinks that, though the RV is principally intended for the service of gods, there are, in it, certain clear indications of the cult of the Pitars One such is the mention of narasamsa, which has to be understood as the old name for the fire of the Pitars HILLEBRANDT further says that Narāśamsa is also the designation of a god who stands in the same relation to the fire of the Pitars as Surya does to the&#xA;4 Sce Srautakofa, Vol 1, English Section, 1160&#xA;5 VAL II, 98 ff [It may be noted that, for this paper, the first ed, in three parts, of HILLEBRANDT&amp;rsquo;S Vedische Alythologie, Breslau, 1891-1902, has been used ]&#xA;280&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;ahayanıya fire He, however, hastens to add that the starting point of bis hypothesis is, indeed, not the RV, but the later and surer ritual tradition In the Soma-sacrifice, there are to be offered five nārāśamsas - two in the morning, two at midday, and ope in the evening Nārāśamsa, in this context, is the pame given to certain goblets of Soma The officiating priests first drink out of these camasas, perform an apyayana in respect of them (by means of Soma, or, according to Baudhāyana, by means of the yasainiart waters, or, according to some other teachers, by mere touching ), and then place them under the southern havırdhana cart It is said in the commentary on ApSS 12 25 25 that&#xA;because these goblets have Narāsamsa as their divinity, they are called parasamsas? The putting dowp of the camasas on the ground and towards the south puts their connection with the cult of the Pitars beyond doubt the close connection between the pārāsamsas and the Pitars becomes further clear from the follow ing significant reference occurring in SPB, IJI 6 2 25 yad havırdhanayor nāraśamsah sidantı tat prirsu juhon tasmāt pilarah sant. The mantra, which is prescribed to accompany the con suming of the Soma in these camasas by the officiating priests is given in the AitBr 7 34 as narasamsapitasya deva soma te matıyıda amaih [(at the morning pressing), urvail (at the midday pressing), kavyaih (at the third pressing) i purblir bhaksıtasya bhaksajamı About this, the commentary on the TS says narāśamsapıtasya potrpitasya iti padadvayam narasamsa camasabhaksane eva prayoktavyam, na anyatra, iti ekah paksah / sarvatra pathiravyam iti aparah paksah / naraih śasyante iti narā samsah pitrvisesah The mantra prescribed in this connection by the SankhśS 7 5 22 is also quite revealing devo &amp;lsquo;si narāśamso yat te miedhah svar jyotis tasya ta ūmaih 1(at the morning pressing), urvaih (at the midday pressing), kavyaih ( at the third pressing )] pirblur bhaksıtasjo pahulasyo &amp;lsquo;pahuto bhak sayāmı When the varasamsas are got ready at the midday savana, daksinä is given away to the priests And the priests seem to have been often regarded as representatives of the Pitars For, since the&#xA;6&#xA;TS Como III, p 110&#xA;anvāharya caru is cooked on the daksina fire, it must have been intended for the Pıtars, but it is actually given over to the priests as the representatives of the Pitars At the third sarana, an offering is directly made to the Pitars 10 close connection with the nārasamsa camasas It is further noteworthy that, when the nārāsamsas are laid down at their respective places, each priest puts under bis camasa three picces of the remaining purodāsa, for his ancestors In the namaskāra mantras connected with this rite also, a Dention is made of the Pitars Thus, accordipg to HILLEBRANDT, the close relationship between Narāsamsa and the Pitars is beyond reasonable doubt&#xA;HILLEBRANDT finds support for his hypothesis also from RV X 57 3, which, according to the SŚS (III 17 3), is emplo yed in a Patryajaa The Th reads&#xA;mano ny a huamahe narasamsena somena/&#xA;pilinām ca manmabluli// It is significant that, according to the sankiss, the officiating priest steps behind the dak sina fire (that is, the fire of the Pitars) with this and the following two verses HILLEBRANDT inciden tally refers also to the formula from the VS (19 61 ), which is employed at the Pitryajña in the Sauirāmani, namely, agnisy attān tumaro hajamahe naraśamse soniapıtham ya asuh&#xA;There is another line of argument in support of the above hypothesis As is well known, the name nārasamsi is given to certain Vedic texts, which are mainly intended to praise the daksinas given away, in former times, by liberal patrons These are recited alternately with the pāriplavas, which glorify the models in history and legends of the sacrificing princes Thus the närāśansıs, like the pariplavas, are, by and large, devoted to the glorification of some deceased princes or other distinguished&#xA;dead persons In other words, according to HILLEBRANDT, they relate to the cult of the Pitars The närāśamsverscs, as verses relatiog to the Pitars, are regarded as being of a lower order in comparison to the verses relating to the gods For, the MS (1. 11,5 ) says Jo gathanārāsamsıbhyam sanon na tasja prais.&#xA;36&#xA;282&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;The word anrta in this context&#xA;grhy am anrtena in sa tat sanoti implies the lower order&#xA;The material about Narasamsa in the RV is decidedly scanty, and the few passages where the word naraśanısa occurs are either colourless or obscure It may, however, be noted that in each of the two Bihaspati hymns, namely, I 18 and X 182, one stanza is addressed to Narasamsa? This may suggest that here Nara Samsa and Brhaspati are more or less identified According to RY LX 83 3 Brhaspati is closely related to the Pitras HILLEBRANDT further adds that Brhaspati is essentrally the moon god and the moon is basically the divinity of the Pitars All these facts would then seem to confirm the close relationship between Narasamsa and the Pitars In MS IV 13 8 and TBr III 6 13 Narasamsa 15 called triśırsan and sadaksa These latter are also the epithets of Visvarupa, who, too, is identified with the moon or the god of the Pitars It is, accordingly, averred that Broaspati, Visvarupa, and Narāśamsa have a common origin and that all the three are closely related to the cult of the Pilars&#xA;Though HILLEBRANDT generally believes that the etymo logy of a Vedic god s pame does not necessarily help a correct understanding of that god&amp;rsquo;s nature, in the word narasamsa, he tries to find support for his present hypothesis According to bim, the literal meaning of the word, namely, praise of men, makes no sense whatever There is no doubt that nara in naraśamsa stands for the genitive plural naram It is to be regarded as an object genitive form T he root sams may be connected with the Avestan sanh, Latin censeo, and samsa which is an agent noun, derived from that root, may mean censor&amp;rsquo; Nardansa 15, accordingly, hominum judex, that is, the &amp;lsquo;censor of mea, or, secondamny, the adjudicntor of the dead&amp;rsquo;s Like Yama, he is the lord and the leader of the Pitars&#xA;In the Vedic ritual, there are three principal fires, out of which one, namely, the daksina fire, is assigned to the Pitars&#xA;7 AV I 18 9, 4, 182 2 B. VAI II, 105-06&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY&#xA;283&#xA;And, as has been pointed out above, in the RV, Agni Narāśamsa is closely related to the cult of the Pitars From this, it is conclu ded that Agni Narāsamsa is the duk sina fire of the later ritual&#xA;There have also been other attempts to identify the sacrificial fires with the various forms of the Rgvedic Agni It is, for in stance, suggested that the ahgiani a fire is related to the heavenly form of Agni represented by Surya the dah sina fire to the aerial form of Agnt represented by Vayu Indra, or Vidyut, and the garhopatya fire to the terrestrial Agni But, in this lecture, I am not directly concerned with any of these attempts I may, how ever, refer to one fact which is perhaps pertinent to our present purpose It is this While HILLEBRANDT identifies Agni Narā. samsa with the dok sina fire LUDWIG thinks that Agn Nara Samsa is to be identified with the ahaianiya fire&amp;rsquo; or course, both these views seem to me to be quite unacceptable But here I propose to deal at some length only with the former HILLE BRANDT seems to think that the Rgvedic material is hopelessly unhelpful in the matter of determining the character of Narsamsa He, therefore, makes the later ritual tradition the starting point of his hypothesis The more correct method perhaps consists in first probing into the Rgvedic material thoroughly and then correlating that material with the material derived from the ritual tradition&#xA;Let us then examine the Rgvedic material It should be noted at the very outset, that, in the RV, one hardly finds emphasised any special relationship between Naraśamsa and Agn: Indeed, the concept of Agni Narāsamsa as such, does not exist in that Veda RV III 29 11 actually implies that Agar and Narasamsa are two separate entities Fren in the Nighantu 10 Narasamsa is given as an independent appellation Narīvamsa 15 twice connected with Pusan (I 106 4 and X 64 3) Hc 15 mentioned in the second verses of four Apri hymns (namely, II 3, V 5, VII 2, and X 70 ) and in the third verses of two Apri&#xA;9 10&#xA;Dar Rigteda 111, 355-56.&#xA;V, 1,5284&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;hymns (namely, I 13 and I 142) Incidentally, I may mention that, here, I have not taken into account the distinction made, 10 the Saryanul ramani of Katyavana, between the Apra and the Apri la RV X 92 11, Narasamsa is characterised as caturanga &amp;lsquo;four bodied&amp;rsquo;, but it is not clear whether, in that passage, caturanga is the epithet of Narāśamsa or of the following divinity Yama Naraśamsa is gnaspati lord of a celestial wife&amp;rsquo; (II 38 10) He is honey tongued madhujilna) and an offerer of oblations (havishrt) (I 13 3) and has honey in his hand (V 52) Three times a day, he spriokles the sacrifice with honey (I 142 3) He leads the gods to sacrifice (X 70 2) Among the gods, the greatness of Narusamsa is to be celebrated, for, it is through him that gods come and accept the sacrifice (VII 2 2) Narāśamsa ordains the forms of sacrifice and brings the gods together at the summit of the sacrifice (11 32) The close relationship between Narāśamsa and Brbaspati, as indicated 10&#xA;RVI 18 9 and X 182 2, has been already referred to above&#xA;It will be clear from this brief statement, based on the Rgvedic material, that Narāsamsa is nowhere accompanied by the name Agai, that he is pot connected exclusively with Agni, that no special relationship between Narāśamasa and the Pitars is anywhere indicated, and that, on the other hand he is closely associated with the gods and is mainly responsible for bringiog them to the sacrifice and for making the sacrifice acceptable to them It must also be emphasised that the bynas in which Narasamsa figures prominently, namely, the Apri hymns, relate to animal sacrifice and not to the cult of the Pitars&#xA;HILLEBRANDT&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the name narasamsa as hominum judex or censor is, indeed, too bold The two accen ted word narasamsa is split up into its two elements as dia jana yatayann antar syate nara ca samsam daivyam ca dharları ja RV IX 86 42 and as nara va samsam pusanam agohyam agnim deveddhan abhy arcase gira in X 64 3 &amp;lsquo;That, in these passages, the word nara stands for naram is clearly indicated by another passage helonging to the same category, namely, RV II 34 6 a no brahmani marutah samanyavo naram na samsah savanani&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY&#xA;285&#xA;gantana As a matter of fact, the word camisa conected with narām (or nrnām) occurs in many other passages, such as, I&#xA;173 9 and 10, VI 24 2, and III 16 4 Attention may be drawn, in this context, also to the phrase narya Samsa (1 1859) A&#xA;divinity called Nisainsa, which can be presumed to be identical with Narasamsa, is mentioned in IX 81 5, and, significantly enough, like narasamsa, the word nrśamsa also has two accents In all these passages, narā or narām is subject genitive (and not object-genitive as HILLEBRANDT takes it to be ) This assump tion is confirmed by some other passages where the word samsa is accompanied by undoubted subject genitive forms such as, asmahan (1 94 8), yajamānasja (1 178 4, II 20 7), and mama (1 182 4) As for the element samsa in narasamsa, the 10ital accent would clearly show that the word cannot be an agent poun as HILLEBRANDT assumes What is, however, still more significant for our purpose is that samsa (particularly when it is joined to nara or narām or nrnam), nowhere in the RY, means &amp;lsquo;censor lord&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;adjudicator&amp;rsquo; Sansa is derived from the root canis, which originally means nuch more than to praise. It means &amp;rsquo;to utter ceremoniously an esoterically work ing magically potent formula! This meaning receives support from many Rgvedic passages such as, 1 21 2,33 7, JIL 3 8, VI 29 4, VII 19 9 The element śmsa in narasamsa is a nomen actiones from this root sams The primary sense of narasamsa is, accordingly, the samsa or the magically potent formula produced by men or priests incidentally it may be pointed out that the interpretation of the word nrfnar in the sepse of priests need not be regarded as strange On the contrary, the use of the word in that sense is historically very significant it is well known that, at one stage in the evolution of the Vedic mythology, with a VicW to counterbalancing the national war god Indra whose growing importance tended to result in martial valour completely super seding priestcraft, the Vedic poct priests created the concept of a god of magically potent mantros, namely, Bṣbaspatt or Brāhmaṇa. spati, and sought to clevate that god to the position of the war god Indra by endowing him with many epithets and accesso TICS usually attributed to the latter Brtaspati or Brāhmaṇaspati&#xA;286&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;actually came to be celebrated as being responsible for many of Indra&amp;rsquo;s exploits Naturally enough, in this new mythological perspective, the persons who were most active in the special domain of Brhaspati Brāhmaṇaspati, namely, the Vedic poet priests, were endowed with an epithet derived from the domain of the war-god lodra, namely, nr/nar&#xA;The primary sense of narasamsa is the magically potent formula produced by men, that is, priests Narāśamsa then also represented the divine personification of such formula It would now become abundantly clear why Narasamsa is characterised as devānām agrajalā (X 702) and why he is said to make sacrifice acceptable to the gods The sphere of Narāśamsa&amp;rsquo;s activity is sacrifice to the gods, he is kavi, vipra, and mativid, he is honey tongued, in the Apri hynas, he is mentioned with such essential adjuncts of sacrifice as barhis, yūpa, etc All this would now be in order It may be further pointed out that Narāśamsa is closely associated with Brhaspati pot because both of them are connected with the cult of the Pitars, but because Bçhaspati Brāhmaṇaspati is the lord of the magically potent formula and so is Narāśamsa In the RV, Narasamsa is a living religio mythological concept, which must have originally been independent of the concept of Agni This concept involved two main ideas, namely, (1) of priestly efficacy and (2) of the magically potent formula itself functioning as the duta of the gods These two were also the main ideas, which were originally 10volved in the concept of Agni And it is from this specific point of view that the two originally independent concepts namely, those of Narasamsa and Agni, are brought together&#xA;The Vedic Narāsa msa has his obvious counterpart in the Avestan Nairyosanha It is true that this pale and insignificant Avestan dividity does not throw any special light on the character of Narasamsa One reference from the Vendidad is, however, of some consequence for our present purpore Vendidad 19 34 reads &amp;ldquo;The aśa believers unite together, Nairyosanha unites himself with them, the messenger of Ahura Mazdah, that is Nairyosanha &amp;quot; Similarly, Nairyosanhi&amp;rsquo;s main function sceps to&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY&#xA;287&#xA;have been indicated in Vd 22 7 fr, which says “To Nairyo. sanha spake he, the creator Ahura Mazdah, &amp;ldquo;O eloquent Nairyosanha, go to the house of Airyaman and convey to him the following message&amp;rsquo; In pursuance of this behest, the eloquent Nairyosanha went and conveyed the message to Airyaman &amp;quot; Nairyosanha&amp;rsquo;s epithet eloquent&amp;rsquo; and his service as duta establish that Avestan dividity&amp;rsquo;s close affinity to Naraśamsa (and also to Agoi)&#xA;HILLEBRANDT makes great capital of the RV passage X 57 3, mano n a huamahe narasamsena somena / piirnām ca manmabhuih, to support his hypothesis On account of the occurrence of nārāṣamsa, soma, and putrs in close proximity in this rk, he immediately connects it with the rite relating to the nārāsassa camiasa in the Soma sacrifice For whatever ritualistic purpose this hymn may have been prescribed by the later SS, what is here suggested by HILLEBRANDT is quite unwarranted, so far as the Rgvedic evidence is concerned Tradition gives a distinct historical legendary background for the group of the four Gaupayara hymns, namely, X 57-60, and in this background, there is not even a remote hint of a Soma sacrifice King Asa mati of the Iksvākus dismissed thc Gaupāyana brothers, who had held the office of his Purohita, and appointed two incantation experts in their place in great resentment, thic Gaupāyanas practised imprecation against the king Thereupon the two pew Purohias killed Subandhu, one of the Gaupuyana brothers It scems from the present passage, X 37 3, that the remaining three brothers sought to invoke back the spirit of the deceased Subandhu in three ways, namely, by means of narāśamsa or magically potent formula, by means of Soma, and through the prayers of the Pitars&#xA;As for the evidence derived from the Soma camasas, called Darāśamsas, I should, first of all, like to point out that it is methodologically not correct to utilize later ritual tradition as a primary source for the understandig of the Rgvedic mythology, particularly when the RV itself can provide a fairly helpful amount of material for that purpose Besides, a critical study of the&#xA;288&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;mantras and ritual action connected with the rite of the pārāśamsa camasas would seem to show that that rite did not relate to the cult of the Pitars in general It, no doubt, implies a kind of glorification of the Pitars — but not of all the Pitars Only such priestly ancestors are here intended as had, through the grace of god Narāsamsa, mastered the art of narāśamsa or magically potent formulas It should be noted that, in the mantras employed in this connection, such as, upahutā rsayo daivyasas tanūpārānas tanvas tapoja upa nam rayo dawjaso hvayantâm tanūpavānas tanvas tapojah (AsvśS 561) and śrvo me saptarsin upa 11 sthasva (KatSS 9 12 4 ), the rsis or sapta rsayah are specifically mentioned, that the Pitars drinking from the nārāsamsa camasas are called vipra, and that one class from among them is designa ted as kāvya It is perhaps still more noteworthy that, in this context, Soma is characterised as matnud The priests and their rsi-ancestors are supposed to be drinking together from the same camasas, so that the blessing of Narásamsa, which the ancestors had enjoyed, would be available also to the present generation In the complex ritualistic situation implied by the rite of the narasamsa camasas the relationship between Narasamsa and the Pitars corresponds to that between Brhaspati Brahminaspati and the Angirases Those Pitars do not represent manes in general; they rather represent the priestly rsi ancestors like the Angirases&#xA;Coming now to the nārāsanisis, it must be pointed out that there is no ground whatsoever for the assumption that they em body the praise or glorification exclusively of deceased princes and other distinguished personalities The being dead of these personalities nowhere figures as an essential feature of the nara samsis As a matter of fact, a larger number of these texts relate to living patrons By no stretch of imagination, therefore, can the narasamsis be connected even remotely with the cult of the Pitars We have seen that norāśamsa denotes, on the one hand, magically efficacious formula, and, on the other, the presiding divinity of such a formula It is permissible to assume a further semasiological extension of this word on what may be called a material plane, whereby narasamsa came to mean also the matç&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY&#xA;289&#xA;Tial reward which was made possible by the naraśamsa formula The verses which celebrated these rewards and their donors then came to be designated as nārajamsis&#xA;The word narasamsa has two accents (cf Panj VI 2 140 ), and this does create some difficulty The fact that norāśansa has two accents and that the first element looks like a dual form have led some scholars to think that narasanusa is a diandia compound, more particularly a devatā diandra Which two divities are designated by this name? In the history of the Vedic studies in the West - particularly of the studies relatiog to the Vedic my thology &amp;ndash; at least three distinct currents of thought can be clearly marked out so far as the naturalistic noterpretation of that my thology is concerned According to one current of thought, whose great sponsor may be said to have been MAX MULLER, most of the important mythological concepts in the Veda can be satisfactorily interpreted as representing different variations of the activity of the sun In other words, according to this current of thought, the Vedic mythology is essentially a solar mythology The second school of thought is represented by HILLEBRANDT and, to some extent, OLDENBERG, who are inclined to see in the Vedic mythology a preponderance of the moon god Anthropo. logy has established that in the mythologies of most of the primi. tive peoples the moon plays a more important role than the sun And this, it is asserted, is but what is to be expected According to HILLFBRANDT, the Vedic mythology is no exception to thus rule Then there is the third view, accordiog to which the Veda consists mainly of the myths of thunder and lightning An attempt 15 made to interpret the derara diandva, narážanısa, in the ught of this last view, as representing lightning and thunder 11 The root Sams, it is pointed out, means to announce&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;to express ceremo Diously, and, then, &amp;rsquo;to portend&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;to prophesy&amp;rsquo; The goun samsa would then mean that which prophesies* or &amp;lsquo;a portent&amp;rsquo; la the agrarian culture of the Vedic people, the portent which was most anxiously sought was that of cloud and thunder So the word&#xA;11 EW FAY, &amp;ldquo;The Aryan God of Lightning&amp;rsquo;, 4JP465, 1ff,&#xA;290&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;samsa came to denotc cloud and thunder in a rather prominent way It is possible to derive from samsa the sense of cloud or thunder in another way also Thc root sams mcans &amp;rsquo;to speak out&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;to pronouncc loudly, to roar&amp;rsquo;, the nomen agentis, Samsa, would then mean the roaring one. As for the clement narā, it is to be derived from the root nr / mrt &amp;rsquo;to dance&amp;rsquo; And in the context of thunder &amp;lsquo;dancing&amp;rsquo; is the characteristic feature of lightning The meaning of nr / nar as warrior represents the semantic extension of the root nr / art &amp;rsquo;to dance&amp;rsquo;, in another direction, through the intermediate stage of the concept of war dance Thus the compound narålamisa denotes dancing or leap ing&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;portending or roaring&amp;rsquo;, or, in other words, lightning and thunder&amp;rsquo; Incidentally it is also suggested that the entire compound nara anusa is to be found with its members 10 reverse order, in the Greek namc, Kassandrē.&#xA;It is hardly necessary to subject the interpretation of nari. śansa as lightning and thunder&amp;rsquo; to any serious examination Suffice it to say that it is quite unsustainable both linguistically and conceptually The hypothesis seems to have had its starting point in the consideration of the accent of the word naraśamsa If naraśamsa is a detalā diandia (Panipi VI 2 141 does not regard it as such ), why, it may be asked, is the second member of the compound also not represented in sts dualized form? Even so far as the first member of the compound is concerned, as has been indicated above, the relevant Rgvedic references make it neces sary to understand nará as standing for the genitive plural naram rather than as a nominative dual form The difficulty in inter preting samisa with its initial accent as a nomen agentis has been already mentioned above Conceptually, there is no trace of lightning and thunder in any of the Naraśamsa passages alluded to above One thing cannot, however, be gainsaid, namely, that, in any hypothesis, the accent of narasamsa will remain an irregularity&#xA;The Apri hymns, which may be characterised as purposeful but obscure conglomerations of mutually not very consistent ritualistic concepts, indeed, constitute a veritable problem in&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY&#xA;291&#xA;Vedic studies To my mind, most of the points, involved in that problem, continue to defy satisfactory elucidation even to this day&#xA;There are two distinct types of Apri hymns — this distinction being mainly based on the consideration as to which of the two divinitas, Narāśamsa and Tanupapat, is celebrated in their second verses Out of the ten āpri hymos in the RV, four (namely, I 188, III 4, IX 5, and x 110) belong to the exclusive Tanunapāt type, and four (namely, II 3, V 5, VII 2, and X 70 ) to the ex clusive Naraśamsa type, while two (namely, I 13 and I 142) have Tanūnapät celebrated in their second verses and Narasamsa in their third verses It may be presumed that these two types of Apri hymns reflect an ancient schism in the Vedic ritual tradition. We have already studied the concept of Narasamsa Let us now try to find out what Tanunapāt represents, and see whether the fixation of the character of these two, namely, Narāśamsa and Tanūnapät, throws any light on the sclism reflected in the Apri hymos&#xA;The word, tanīnapal, generally unaccompanied by agmi, occurs eight times in the RV-six of these occurrences being in the Apri hymns The facts that the Nighantu (5 2) regards Tanu napāt as an independent pane, that the concept of Agni Tapu napát, as such, does not exist in the RV, and that, in RV III 4 2 and II 29 II, Tapuna pāt is actually sought to be distinguished from Agni would seem to suggest that, like Narāśamsa, Tanupapāt also originally represented an independent religio mythological concept and that, on account of some essential common point, that concept was brought in close relationship with the concept of Agni&#xA;Tapunapät is described as beautiful-tongued (X 110 2) He is besought to take the sacrifice to gods (I 13 2) of bim it is said, in RV III 42, that gods, Varuga. Mitra, and Agni, implore him threc times a day, every day In RV III 29 11, where he is sharply distinguished from Matariyan and Narasamsa, he is referred to as asura garbla Depending on RV IX 52, HILLEBRANDT, the advocate of the moon mythology in the Veda, pace regarded Tanunapät as lunar fire, but later gave up that&#xA;292&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;hypothesis 12 On the whole, the scanty — and more or less conventional — descriptions of Tanunapāt in the RV are of little help in determiniog his character Later Vedic ritual has a rite called Tanudaptra, at which the officiating priests and the sacri ficer are expected to take oaths of mutual loyalty and help The mantras which are prescribed to accompany the taking up of clarified butter for this site, namely, apataje tva grlınamı pari pataye tva grhnamı tanunapire tia grhnámi, etc, are given in TS I 2 10, and the commentary on this passage explains āpati as prāna, paripati as manas, and tanīnaptr as jātharagni The SPBr, on the other hand, describing the tanunaptra rite, seems to interpret tanūnapat quite differently When the gods took the oath of alliance in the presence of Prajapati, Tanupapāt, the strong one, was the witness And, as the Brāhmana adds (III 4 25) He who blows is Tanunapāt, the strong one He is the superintendent of all beings, within whom he moves as in and out breath So Tanunapat is there regarded as a wind god But, elsewhere, the ŚPBr itself identifies Tapunapat with grisma or the summer-sun It says (I 5 3 10) grismo vai tanunapad grismo hy asam prajānam tandis tapası The TBr (II 6 7) brings Tanuvapat in close relationship with Indra, while the MS (IV 13 2) characterises him as aditeh garbha and bhuvanasya gopa All this material concerning Tarunapāt, which has been derived from the texts relating to the Vedic ritual is as unhelpful from our point of view as the Rgvedic material The name tanūnapat also provides no useful clue Assuming the identity of Tanunapat with Agai, the word tanūnapat is explained as *son of himself&amp;rsquo;, which implies fire spontaneously generated in wood and cloud According to BERGAIGNE, Tanunapät is the bodily, that is, aurasa, son of the divine father 18 Adverting to the double accent of the word tanūnapar (cf Pānını VI 2 140), FAY, who would regard the Vedic mythology as essentially the mythology of lightning understands tanunapāt as a diandra compound denoting thunder (tanu from the root ran/stan) and lightning 14 This is obviously too far fetched (It may also be&#xA;12&#xA;VAL II 110 ff&#xA;13 LRI II, 99&#xA;R&#xA;14&#xA;Op at.&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY&#xA;293&#xA;pointed out that Pânici VI 2 141 does not regard tanūnapät as a deiatā dvandva) So the original character of Tapunapät re mains vague and uncertain&#xA;A hypothesis may, however, be hazarded in this connection Whatever the origin of Tapunapāt, it may be assumed that, at somc stage in the evolution of that concept, Tapunapát came to be identified with Agni This may have been due to the recogni tion of the fact that Agoi himself is the seed of Agol, that Agai is his self-son&amp;rsquo; This characteristic feature of Agni perhaps became most evident in a sacrifice, where one sacrificial fire is * spread out&amp;rsquo; from another As is well known, the Vedic sacrifice 1s constituted mainly of two basic elements, the ritual action and the magical formula relating to that action, or karma and mantra, The ritual action or karma is usually centred round the sacrificial fire and may be symbolized by Tapudapāt And we have already seen that Narāśamsa symbolizes the magically potent mantra Can the two types of Apr hymns be regarded as representing two schools of thought in the Vedic ntual tradition &amp;ndash; the Tanunapat school emphasizing the superiority of harma over mantra and the Narāsansa school emphasizing the superiority of manfra over karma ?&#xA;Unlike the words, narasamsa and taninapát, the word, vaisia. nara, Dever occurs in the RV unaccompanied by the name Agni Yanvānara is found mentioned in fourteen hymns of the RY, of almost all of which Vaisvanara Agai is the devata according to the Anukrananı In the Nighanju (51) also, Vaisyanara is gives as one of the games of Ago! It has been long sisce established that, at some stage in the cvolution of the Vedic mythology, Agni came to be identified with Surya In most of such cases where Surya is conceived of as a form of Agni, it is Vaiśvānara Agai that is specifically intended The small group of hymns, pamely, RV VI 7-9, or verses 10-13 of RV X 88, would place this point beyond any rcasonable doubt, for, in these passages, Agni Varśvānara occurs more or less as a synonym of Surya This conception of Valvānara Agni as Surya is continued also in the Vedic ritual The most usual oblation to Agai Vaizvā294&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;para consists of a sacrificial cake on twelve potsherds (dia daśakapala purorlasa), which is obviously suggestive of the twelve months of the year As the TS (II 25 says yad vaiśianaro dvadaśakapalo bhavati samvatsaro ya agnir vaistanarah 15 And the close relationship between samvatsara and Surya is self evident Further, the pravargya is undoubtedly a tite connected with Surya, and there too Agai Vaisvanara is clearly mentioned The TA (V 10 5) actually says esa va agnir saisvanaro pat pra vargyah A mention may be made in this context, of another ritualistic feature of Vaisvanara Agni, which is particularly signi ficant from our present point of view Vaisvanara Agni and the Maruts are set side by side as representing a prince and his sub jects The TS (IJ 2 5 6) for instance, prescribes vaisianaram diadasakapalam mirvapen marulam saptahapalam graniakamah This connection between Vaiśvānara Agni and the ksatra is fur ther confirmed by the rite relating to the dhrina goblet In the Agnistoma the dhruva goblet is placed on a golden plate and is believed to belong to Vatsvanara This goblet has to be guarded by a royal prince, and a series of ritualistic ceremonies, implyiog the setting aside of the usurper and the restoration of the right. ful ruler is performed in respect of it That, in the TBr (II 2 54) Vaisvanara is referred to as a chariot is also quite suggestive&#xA;But Agni Vaisvabara is also mentioned in connection with the descent of Agni to the earth (RV III 24, VI 84) In deed, in passages like RV I 59 2, we actually have Vaisvanara represented in two forms as the head of the heaven (mürdha dnal) and as the navel of the earth (nablih priluvah) RV X 88 14 speaks of Vatsvānara as prevailing avastat and parastal This would explaia why in Nir 7 23, Vaisvanara is explained as Surya by the ancient Yajnikas, and as &amp;rsquo;this Agni&amp;rsquo; by Śakapuni ( with whom incidentally, Yaska himself seems to agree) Vaisvā. nara is in a few passages mentioned in juxtaposition with Surya (cf RVI 98 1) and, in one passage (IV 14 11 ), the MS speaks of voisvanaram bibhrarı bhumih&#xA;15&#xA;Also ace TS I 5 11&#xA;A&#xA;LI&amp;gt; OF AGNINI ULL JI&#xA;.&#xA;Agar Vanvīnara, accordiogly, does not seem to have been conceived by the Vedic poet as belonging to any particular region, As has been pointed out in RI&amp;rsquo; VII 5 4, the thrcefold world, the heaven and the earth, follost the ordinance of Varsvānara Agni fara frıdhatu prihni uta djanr jaisvanara Tratam agno sacanta Vanvānara Agai thus represents a mythological concept which transcends the frequently mentioned triple character of Agi Vaby para Agni is, verily, the Agai who pertains to all men It may be remembered that there are many Agnis men tioned in the RV- Agni of Drvodās and Agni of Vadhryaśva, and Agni of the Bharatas and Agni of the Kausikas Similarly, in the diesta we have athar burzin (fire of the agriculturists ), athar guśasp (fire of the warriors) and athar fra fire of the priests) But this is Agnu Vaisvānara, the Agnt of all men !&#xA;It has been suggested above that the two originally inde pendent divinities, namely, Narāsamsa and Agni, are brought together in close relationship on account of certain common characteristics which they share The basic concept underlying Narāśamsa is that of the magically potent formula, which attracts the gods towards itself, which, in other words, leads the gods to the sacrifice and makes the sacrifice acceptable to them in a sense, therefore, Naraśamsa functions as an efficient intermediary beta ween men and gods He is the duta or envoy serving, in a variety of ways, as a necessary connecting link between the gods and the sacrifice It is exactly this character as an intermediary between men and gods, as a dura, as a priest who makes the sacrifice efficacious, which is the most basic character of the Rgvedic Agar It needs to be emphasised, over and over again, that the Vedic mythology is, in essence, by no means naturalistic Tliat is to say, the personification of natural powers and nhenomena must not be regarded as the starting point of the genesis of the Vedic gods It is not as if the Vedic people derfied the natural clcmcnt of fire and thereby produced the mythological concept of Vedic Agni History of religion clearly shows that a specific religio mythological concept originates independently in a specific cu ral environment, and it is only at some later stage, and as&#xA;296&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;after-thought, that that concept is associated with some natural phenomenon of course such wedding of a religio mythologie cal concept to a phenomenon of nature does not necessarily occur in every case In a sense, naturalism is the result of a kind of poetic operation Natural phenomena are thought of merely as suitable symbols&amp;rsquo;, through which religio mythologi. cal concepts can be effectively expressed These concepts evolve independently before they are thus brought into entirely extraneous relationship with patural powers and phenomena The fact that one and the same dividity is often connected with several natural phenomena is very significant in this context For, it only shows that a single religio mythological concept can be ex pressed through different symbols&amp;rsquo; Naturalism is thus entirely secondary (except in respect of a few &amp;rsquo;elemental&amp;rsquo; dividities ), and ought never to be made the starting point of a mythological study&#xA;It is often said that the character of the Vedic god Agni is most transparent It is thereby suggested that, since Agai merely represents the divine personification of the natural element of fire and since fire is so closely related to human life there is hardly anything beyond that element of fire that one can and needs to know in the Rgvedic mythology concerning Agni A critical study of that mythology, on the background of the study of the history of religion in general, would, however, clearly show that the concept of Agni must have originally developed in complete isolation from the natural element of fire It was only seconda rily, and as an after thought, that it was brought in relationship with fire symbolism Had Agnt represented just a deification of the natural phenomenon of fire, that phenomenon having been so close to man, we would have been justified in expecting to find the counterparts of the Vedic Agni in the mythologies at least of all the Indo European peoples But actually we do not find them It is not my intention, in this lecture, to elucidate this my view point any further I shall only repeat that the natural ele ment of fire could not have been the starting point of the Agoje mythology in the Veda One of the main strands in the basic&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY&#xA;297&#xA;concept underlying that mythology is, to put it in simple terms, the notion of a priest, of an efficient and ever-active intermediary between gods and men, of a dūla, of a purolira, revij, and hotr. The nature and functions of a data and a priest are of course manifold, and they are sought to be represented through the Agni-mythology in many ways.&#xA;One of the most significant mythological motifs, in this con nection, is the close relationship between Agni and the Angirases. In nearly all the passages where the word arigiras occurs in the singular, it is an epithet of Aggi. Agai is the first Angiras (1. 31. 1): fram agne prathanio arigirah. He is also the ancient Angiras pūrvo angirah (X. 92. 15), or the oldest of the Angi rases arigirasain jyestha (I. 127.2), or the most inspired among them vepistho arigirasām (VI. 11.3). In RV I. 75. 2 and many other passages, Agni is, indeed, referred to as angirastama. I do not propose here to go into the details of the history of the Aigirases. The Angirases are evidently an ancient historical clan, and, in view of many families of the Rgvedic seers as also individual rsis claiming relationship with the Angirases, BERGAIGNE seems to be right when he speaks of &amp;ldquo;a whole common primitive liturgy of the Angirases &amp;ldquo;.18 To the Angirases certainly belongs a distinct, and, in many cases, unique, tradition of cult and mythology. The strikiog rivalry of the Angirases with the Adityas, their ritualistic innovations, such as, arigirasām ayang and dvirätra, and angirast agniciti and argirasi raśanā, their undisputed mastery over ghora or abhicára rites, their much celebrated tapas, their successful operations against the Paris - all this has endowed the Angirases with a position peculiarly their Own. The Angirases represent, according to the Veda, a kind of deified ur-priests - they are the hallowed ancestors of the entire priest-community. Accordingly, they are also regarded as the most efficacious dūlas or envoys. Indeed, it is this latter aspect of their character which is stressed through their game. There is little doubt that the word argiras is to be philologically connected&#xA;16. Rich. sur l&amp;rsquo;histoire de la lit. Vid., 192, 1&amp;hellip; 1.&#xA;38&#xA;298&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;with the Persian loan word in Greek, namely, aggaros, which means &amp;ldquo;a riding Persian postal messenger&amp;rsquo; Herodot (VIII 98) speaks about the necessary qualities of the aggareion (which latter is obviously a Persian word) Aischylos ( Ag 273 ) refers to the sigoal fire, by means of which destiny was announced to Ilion&amp;rsquo;s home, as aggaron pūr 17 It may, therefore, be presumed that the Greek word aggeros (aggello), meaning &amp;lsquo;messenger&amp;rsquo;, is related, from very early times, to the Aryan words, Vedic angıras and Persian Greek aggaros From Greek, that word was borrowed in Latin ( where it became angelus ), in Gothic (where it became aggilus ), and in Celtish (where it became aingel) Other Germanic languages then took it over from Gothic, and we have engel in new high German, Danish, Swedish and Dutch, angel in English, and angele in old French The angels are the messengers of gods - they are the intermediaries between gods and men And that is also one aspect of the basic character of the Angi rases Naturally enough, Agni, who is regarded as the priest cum intermediary par excellence, is most appropriately designated as angırastama&#xA;This interpretation of the word angiras, derived from a philological consideration of that word, receives confirmation from another source in close proximity with the Angirases is mentioned in the RV another group of ancient priests and seers, namely, the Navagvas Like the Angirases, the Nayagvas also are called our old fathers - nah purie pitarah (VI 22 2) Like the Angirases, again, the Navagvas play a very prominent role in the winning of the cows held in confinement by the Panis (I 62 3-4, V. 45 7, X 108 8) The word navagia has been explained in a variety of ways For instance, it has been suggested, on the analogy of the seven rsis, that the Navagvas are the priests going in a set of nine As an artificial extension of this concept of the Navagvas, the Vedic poets then thought of the Dasagvas (or those priests who went about in 2 set of ten) With the help of these Daśagvas, who, like the Navagvas, are closely associated with the Angirases (X 62.6),&#xA;17. GUENTERT, Der arische Idlilonig und Haland, 283&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY&#xA;299&#xA;Indra is said to have successfully fought Vala (I 624) BLOOM FIELD understands the Navagyas and the Daśagvas as being the priests, who respectively win as daksinā nipe and ten cows apięce 18 According to a third view, the Navagvas and the Daßagvas are priests, who are experts in the matter of sacrifices extending over Dine or ten days This entire play on numbers, however, looks suspicious From such Rgvedic words as etagva and anthgva, it seems certain that the element -gra in naragia is to bc derived from the root sam The element nava, in that case has to be understood 10 the sense of new&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo; newly&amp;rsquo; One is reminded, in this context, of Latio nuntius, which, as is well known, may go back to nouo-uenn os (with the haplological shortenipg of the syllable), meaning &amp;ldquo;coming as a new one. More or less similarly is also formed the old high German, nu chomo 19 The compound, nava gva, would thus rfean going or coming as a new one&amp;rsquo;-semasiologically further extended to mean &amp;lsquo;a new comer&amp;rsquo;,&#xA;one who arrives newly and as such brings in fresh tidings and reports&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;a messenger&amp;rsquo;, or an envoy&amp;rsquo; In other words, naragia ss, in a sepse, a close synonym of angıras However, people soon lost sight of this original sense of the word naragva (and also of angiras), Navagva, like Angiras, became a proper noun In view of the concept of the seven rsrs, the element nava came to be interpreted as pine, and the Navagvas came to deoote the priests going 1D ride. The word daśagia was then artificially coined by way of an analogous extension of the word naiagra&#xA;It is, indeed, significant that the Navagvas also are closely associated with Ago (cf so this context RV VI 6 3) in RV III 39 5 sakha lia jaira sahhibhir naragrair abhuñva sallabhır gā anugman, the word navagra seenis to have been used in its original sense It should be further noted that, while, in this passage, the Dalagvas are mentioned as being &amp;rsquo;top&amp;rsquo;, thc Navagras occur with out any such numerical specification Indra is here said to have echicycd, with the help of the Navagvas (and the Dasagvas ),&#xA;18 JAOS 16 cxxv, 17 PA 17, 426 19 GUENTERT, Opal 201.&#xA;300&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;what he is usually described as achieving with the help of the Angirases, namely, the freeing of the cows and the finding out of the sun&#xA;One of the commonest features of the Agni mythology is the emphasis placed in the RV on the triple character of Agni. It is, indeed, asserted that no cosmological fact is more frequently alluded to in the RV than this three fold division of fire There are as many as seventy passages in that Veda, where this division is referred to with or without some form of the numeral &amp;rsquo;three&amp;rsquo;, RV III 20 2, for instance speaks of Agni&amp;rsquo;s three powers, his three tongues, and his three bodies&#xA;agne tri te vajina tri sadhastha tisras te jihā rajata purvih/&#xA;tisra u te tanvo devavātās tabhir nah pahı giro aprajucchan // In RV III 29, gods are said to have purified three kindlings (sandhah) of Agni, of these, one they assigned to man (martye) for enjoyment, and two went to the sister world (u lokan jamım) Threefold, indeed, are the births of Agni, according to RV IV 1 7 trir asya fa parama santı satya spārha devasya janimany agneh RV X 45 I says First, Agni was born in the heaven, the second time, from us, and the third time, he was born among the waters divas para prathamam jajñe agnir asmad dvitiyam pari&#xA;atayı dah/ trdijam apsu nrmana gjasrani indliana enam jarate svaduh// Elsewhere, the order of Agais abodes is given as heaven, earth, and waters (VII 44. 16, X 27, X 46 9) or as ocean, heaven, and waters (I 95 3) It is usually believed that the three forms of Agni are Surya in the heaven, Agni on the earth, and lightning in waters Terrestrial and solar fire, as being permanent and appearing every day, were paturally regarded as the first and the second forms, while ys Geeting and 125er warfes tation was looked upon as the third&#xA;Incidentally, it has been suggested by MACDONELL that this threefold nature of Agni, so clearly recognised in the RV, IS probably the prototype not only of the posterior triad of Sun, Wind, and Fire ( VIII 18 9), which is spoken of as distributed in the three worlds (cf X 158 1), but also of the triad of Sun,&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY&#xA;301&#xA;Indra, and Fire, which though not Rgvedic, is still ancient 20 Here, according to MACDONELL, Vata or Väyu and Indra have taken the place of Agni Vaidyuta the lightning Agni, as the Brāhmaṇas and the comnientators call him&#xA;There is in the RV, a divinity called Apām Napāt which is celebrated in one whole hymn (II 35), is jovoked in two verses of a fymp to the waters (X 30 344) and is mentioned by name nearly thirty times altogether in that Veda 21 Three disttoctive features of the nature of that divinity are supposed to have been clearly brought out from the descriptions in the RV, namely, dwelling and concealment in the waters, swiftness, and fierincss These are the essential features also of lightning It is therefore, presumed that Apum Napat is a divinity of lightning Now the facts such as that Agnt is sometimes directly referred to as Apām Napāt II 143 1. VS 8 24 ) and Apām Napát is inı oked as Agoi ( II 35 15) that Agni is characterised as apām garbha (III 1 12-13, VIT 9 3 ) and that he is also called adreh sūnu *son of the rock&amp;rsquo; (X 20 7 ) seem to suggest that the Vedic poet thought of Agni and Apām Napāt as being identical The conclusion then becomes irresistible that Apām Napat is the name given to Agni as produced from the waters in the form of lighting In other words Apam Napat represents the third or the lightning form of Agni MACDONELL who strongly advo cates this view, further says that the Vedic god Trita also is no other than the third or the lightning form of Agar 22 That Tnta is a dividity of lightning is MACDONELL believes, supported by all the Rgvedic passages relating to him Lightoing is the chief agent in the thunderstorm and its manifestation precedes the release of the heavenly waters According to MACDONELL, It is thus a matter of course that Trita should be associated with Indra in the conflict with the drought fiend He is further naturally identified with the celestial steed the personification of lightning as having in the highest degree the quality most distinc&#xA;20 MACDONELL, Vedic Alythology 93 21 MACDOVELL, Opat, 69 22 JRAS 1B93 467 fr&#xA;302&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;tive of horse His connection in this character with the Maruts and the rain-cloud, his thundering and his descent to the earth are po less clear Trita&amp;rsquo;s relation to Agni is quite obvious, indeed, he is actually identified with Agni Like Trita, Agou also is frequently associated with Indra Similarly the celestial steed is brought in close relationship with Agni Agni&amp;rsquo;s epithet virahan and his connection with the Maruts also need to be noted in this context Now, since Agni has a lightning form this identification of Trita with Agni must be regarded as referring to that form The exclusive epithet of Trita, namely Āptya, (from ap / ap &amp;ldquo;water&amp;rsquo;) is quite significant in this connection, for, it confirms the essential identity between Trita Āptya and Agni Apām Napat The two divinities have this feature, namely, of being born of waters, in common, and it is shared by no other divinity&#xA;H W MAGOUN also emphasizes the original lightning character of Apām Napāt 23 But, according to him, Apām Napāt Tepresents a form of lightning which is different from the one represented by Agn Following KAEGI and BLOOMFIELD, MAGOUN asserts that there can be no doubt that Agni is originally a god of lightning the lightning that strikes and leaves fire behind it But he adds that the fact that Agpi still retains his character as lightning in parts of the RV is, of itself no reason for identifying him wuth Apām Napat According to him, while Agni is lightning - probably the blinding flash - and fire (and later the sun also ) Apam Napāt is lightning in its most remarkable and conspicuous form, namely, the distant descending bolt, the fascinating and awe-inspiring &amp;lsquo;chain lightning&amp;rsquo;, which, like a molten stream of fire, seems to reach from heaven to earth This is “the swift horsed, the tall and shining lord” of the Avesta, and this is also the Vedic god who, erect, clothed with light, betakes himself to the bosom of the oblique ones&amp;rdquo; and “ whom stallions swift as thought, convey&amp;rdquo; According to MAGOUN, it is sufficiently clear that the country to the north of the Hindu Kush and to the east of the Caspian is a region of&#xA;23 JAOS 19, 137 ff ,4JPh 21, 274 ff&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY&#xA;303&#xA;fearful thunderstorms That the phenomena observed in storms of this kind should not excite the religious imagination of such a people as the Indo-Iranians is hardly to be thought of How did the Inda-Iranians worship the lightning? MAGOUN says that it was in three ways firstly, as a smrtiag fire god, the Vedic Agni Vr̥trahan, secondly, as a wonderful and brilliant child of waters, Apám Napāt, who personified the phenomenon of chain lighting, and, lastly, as a heavenly manifestation, to which, for lack of a befter name, they gave the title Third, that is Vedic Trita, who is probably to be recognized in the highly anthropomorhic Avestan Thraetaona Āthwia&#xA;Three main points emerge out of the fore-going hypothesis (1) that Agni and Apām Napat are identical, (2) that the original character of Apām Napāt is that of a lightning divinity, and (3) that, therefore, that divinity is to be identified with the lightning form of Agni Incidentally, in fairness to MAGOUN whose view has been referred to above, it must be added that it is only the second of these points which he emphasizes&#xA;While trying to controvert these points, I should like to be gin by stating that, in the RY, Agni and Apām Napāt are hardly anywhere properly identified An analysis of the Apam Napāt passages would prove quite revealing in this connection These passages may be broadly classified in four groups To begin with, there are passages in which the existence of Apám Napāt as an independent divinity is clearly established For instance, the only entire hymn that is addressed to Apām Napāt, namely, II 35, belongs to this class Although the final verse of this hymn (II 35 15) meptions Agni, it has apparently nothing to do with the rest of the hymn and is obviously a later addition made for the sake of the refrain Then there are references to Apām Napät in other hymns, mostly in the hymns to All gods (cf II 31 6, VI 50 13, 52 14, VII 35 13, X 92 13) Agni also is mentioned in these hymns, but quite separately from Apām Napät And there is nothing in these hymns which might even remotely imply the identity of these two divinities Thirdly, there are passages in which Apām Napāt is clearly distinguished from Agni One304&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;such passage is VI 13 3, where Agni, the wise one, the Order-born, united with Apām Napāt, is said to make the sage prosper with riches sa satpath savasa hantı yrtram agne vipro vi paner bharti vājam / jam tam praceta rtajata rāyā sajosa naptra &amp;lsquo;pām hunosi // The phrase sajosa naptrā apam leaves no doubt whatever that Ago and Apīm Napat were originally two different divinities As against this, there are passages — only two in number — where Agni is directly referred to as Apām Napāt In III 9 1, a hymn to Agni, napalam is used in apposition to a pronoun of the second person, which is repeated in the following stanza, where Agni is addressed by name Again, in the first verse of I 143, also a hymn to Agni, napät is an apposition to a relative pronoun, whose antecedent is agnaye 24 But, in view of the fact that, in I 22 6, Savits also is called Apām Napät, these two passages would seem to lose much of their probative value They have to be regarded as merely reflecting the tendency, which is special in respect of Agni, namely, of being identified with many gods By way of a diversion it may be mentioned here that the fact that Agni is said to assume forms of many gods (cf III 20 3) has been stressed by GUERINOT to prove his theory that Agni is the ur god 26 Now reverting to the point under discussion, I shall repeat that an analysis of the Apām Napāt passages in the RV indicates not only that Agni and Apānı Napāt are not identified with each other in that Veda but also that they are regarded as two essentially different divinities&#xA;A critical consideration of the descriptions of Apām Napát in the RV would further place it beyond doubt that not only are Agni and Apām Napāt not identical but the essential character of Apām Napāt also is not that of a lightning divinity Apim Napat is characterised as radya bora of rivers&amp;rsquo; (135 1) The beaming waters are said to stand round about the beaming, shin jog Apām Napat tam u sucim sucaj o didnamsam apam napalam pari tasthur apah (JI 35,3) The not pouting young purifying&#xA;24 25&#xA;Also cf VS 8 24 Rech sør I ongine de lider de dieu d après le Rig Veda, Paris, 1900&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY&#xA;305&#xA;waters stream about him, the young one, with mighty splendour, he richly shines with no need of Kindlings, clothed in ghee, in the waters tam asmerā zinatayo juānam marmrjyamanah pari yanty āpah / sa fuhrebluh sikvabli revad asme didaya &amp;rsquo;nıdhmo ghrtanirnig apsu (II 35 4) Apām Napāt shines forth within the waters, for the giving of good to the worshipping one (II 35 7) The theme of II 35 10 is the golden colour of Apāın Napāt There is a reference in II 35 11 to the countenance, to the dear secret name, and to the food of Apan Napāt tad asya &amp;rsquo;nikam uta cāru nāmā &amp;lsquo;picyam vardhate naptur apam / jam indhate yurvatajah sam Itthā hranyavarnam ghrtam annam asya In VII 47 2, the waters are called upon to see that Apam Napāt, the horse-driving one, advances their wave which is most sweet tam urmim ,po madhumattamam 1o &amp;lsquo;pam napád a alv āśuhemā In X 30 3, Apām&#xA;Napāt is implored to give the priests the beautifully clarified wave (ürmı), while in the next verse lie is spoken of as one who shines within the waters with no peed of kindlings, whom the inspired call upon at sacrifices yo andimo didayad apsv antar yam viprāsa ilate adhivaresu He is there asked also to give the sweet waters with which Indra grows strong for his heroic deeds apām napan madhumatir apo da jabhir indro avrdhe viryaya In X 30 14, the priests are asked to deposit the waters in harmony with Apām Napát on the sacrificial grass ni barlısı dhattana somjaso &amp;lsquo;pām naptrā sanıyıdanasa enāh&#xA;It will be seen that, in all these passages, it is essentially the aqueous (or watery) character of Apam Napát that is empha sized, rather than the igneous (or fiery) character There are some references in these passages, which are suggestive of light but not of fire, of shining&amp;rsquo; but not of burniog&amp;rsquo; Besides, many of these references, it should be noted, arc purcly conventional, they are such as may be made to relate to any Vedic god What is perhaps far more significant from our present point of view is that, in none of tbese and other passages, is Apām Napát asso. ciated with clouds&amp;rsquo; as such Surely, the concept of lightning is difficult to comprehend without a mention of the thunderbolt Lightniog, it must be remembered, is 1 child of thundering clouds,&#xA;39&#xA;306&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;rather than of waters (even if these latter are understood as rain waters) Actually one feels inclined to think that the waters with which Apām Napāt is associated are not rain-waters at all Indeed, the descriptions of Apām Napāt are generally too mild to be regarded as reflecting the phenomenon of lightning and thunderbolt&#xA;I have already said that the starting point of the Agni-mytho logy in the Veda is by no means the natural element of fire The basic misconception that Agni exclusively represents fire is here unduly extended to suggest that one form of Agni camely, Agni in waters represents lightning The tendency to see in the Vedic mythology the mythology of thunder and lightning, which was once very prominent, is mainly responsible for this extension of notions When a Vedic poet speaks of Agol in water, he is giving expression to a thought which lives in itself, which is self evident, he is not repeating something which had become un understandable It must surely be a thought pertaining to some thing other than lightning Without going into any details, I may suggest that the relationship between Agni and waters is closely connected with the relationship between water and plants Rgvedic passages such as I 70 3 145 5, X 4 5, 51 3 etc, are highly suggestive in this context Perhaps much more suggestive are the passages VII 93 apam garbhah prasva å viveśa, the embryo of the waters has entered into the sprouting plaats, VIII 43 9 apsv agne sadlis tava sau &amp;lsquo;sadhir ann rudly ase, in the waters, O Agni, is your station, you grow up in the form of plants&#xA;In the Avesta, we have the counterpart of Vedic Apām Napát The Avestan Apām Napat is clearly a spirit of waters, he lives in the depth of waters and is usually invoked with them He is rich in rapid steeds (which seem to represent the billowing waves) and controls the distribution of water over the earth Yasht 19 51 says “This glory got the start upto the sea Vourukasha Straightaway Apám Napāt, whose steeds are swift, seized it, and this was the wish of Apam Napāt, whose steeds are swift I shall seize this glory, the unattainable, at the bottom of the deep sea, at the bottom of the profound lakes&amp;rdquo; And Yasht&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGVI-VIYTHOLOGY&#xA;307&#xA;19,52 continues “We praise the lofty, fordly Apām Napīt, (genus) of women, brilliant, whose steeds are swift, virile, hearing prayer, who created men, who shapxd men, the angel beneath the waters, who hath the most attentive car when he is praised » According to ashe S 4. “from Apām Napat doth come the seed (cihrem) ” The epithet Khsatlırım, which is used in the Aresta exclusively with reference to Anim Napīt, is very significant in this content On the basis of translations like Sanskrit srāmi narinam (Or strirani ), the meaning of Xhcathrin is fixed as “lord of women&amp;rsquo;. This may then bt regarded as an evidence that the divinity in question is “the symbol of the fructifying principle contained in the waters&amp;rsquo; Incidentally it must be emphasized that it is wrong to presume that the primitive peoples were incapable of abstract symbolism or that their symbolism was often startlingly realistic We may, therefore, conclude from the passages, which have been quoted above, and similar other passages that the Avestan Apun Napat has nothing to do with fire or lightning, but that he basically represents &amp;amp; water divinity &amp;ndash; perhaps the divinity which symbolises the fructi fying principle contained in waters&#xA;Evidence from the Vedic ritual also does not seem to support the identification of Apam Napät with Agni For instance, RV X 30 (which is one of the two liymns relating to Apām Napit) is prescribed to be employed in the nites which have to do with water and not fire The hymn is more or less unified in character so far as its subject matter is concerned, and it is to be recited by the Hotę at the fetching of water for sacrifice There is prescribed in connection with this rite also an offering to be made to Apām Napāt in water The mantra prescribed for this offering is VS 6 27 deyir āpo apām napad jo ia irmur hansja indriyavān madintamah/tam deveblyo devatra darta Stihrapebhyo jesam&#xA;bhaga stha siaha Apam Napāt is invariably invoked to promote proper dispensation of water He plays an important role in the Kārlrisn, which is intended as a riturl for rain (cfTS II 481) It is also significant that, according to Kaiss 23 4 14, the prajaścitia rite, prescribed in the event of the sacrificial animal&#xA;308&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;dying in water, consists of an oblation of cooked rice to Apām Napāt 26 Thus, the lightning hypothesis does not receive any support from any Vedic evidence of a primary character It is only secondary sources, such as the commentary on TS IV 14 or the ritual of what may be characterised as adbhuta type, which at all mention lightning&#xA;Anthropological and ethnographical materials such as have been brought forth by TYLOR (Anfang der Kultur ), BRINTON (Religions of Prunime Peoples ), LANG (Mythes, cultes et reli gion), and CROOKE ( Popular Religion) also point to the fact that lightning was never concieved of as an independent divinity by any primitive people Even in ancient saga literature, light ning is mentioned very rarely, if at all It may be presumed that the unsteady nature of lightning does not favour its development into a full fledged divinity&#xA;Three points have thus become quite clear, namely, (1) that Agni and Apām Napat are not identical, (2) that the essential character of Apām Napät is not that of a lightning dividity, but that he is a divinity related to water and (3) that Agni&amp;rsquo;s asso ciation with water by no means represents his lighting form So far as the Agni mythology was concerned, the discussion about Apam Napāt might as well be concluded here But I shall throw out one suggestion Apām Napat was basically a diyoity of an ancient water cult, and, at some stage in the evolution of the Vedic mythology, this water cult was brought into relationship, on the one hand, with the cult of Agni (as the result of a confusion of symbolisms) and, on the other, with the cult of Soma (by way of a religio mythological extension) Indeed, if Apām Napāt was at all to be regarded as being close to any other significant mythological concept in the Veda, it would certainly not be Agai, it would be Soma 1&#xA;Attention may finally be drawn to one more peculiar feature of the Agni mythology in the Veda It will be observed that no&#xA;26 c&#xA;aponaplnyo &amp;lsquo;psu mrle&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY&#xA;309&#xA;counterpart of the name Agoi as such exists in any other Indo European language The connection of the word agni with Latin ignis, Slavonic ognis, and Lithuanian ugnis is uncertain At any rate, these latter words never became appellations of any diyre pities, nor did they become centres of any religious cults As a matter of fact, there does not seem to have developed, in early times, any regular fire cult among the Indo European peoples other than the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians There were, no doubt, the two feminine divinities &amp;ndash; the Greek Hestia and the Roman Vesta We are not here concerned with the question whether Vesta is a mere borrowing from Greece as KRETSCHMER suggests?? or whether she is essentially Roman as assumed by Warde FOWLER28 and FARNELL 29 What is relevant for our purpose is that these divinities are not associated with the fire of any developed cult of sacrifice, they are associated only with the fire of the hearth Even then, they must not be under stood as being related to sacra privata (as against sacra publica)&#xA;There are, however, clear indications that a regular cult of sacrificial fire had developed among the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians Presumably, this cult developed during the common Aryan period, that is to say, during the period when the ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iraniaas lived together in the region round about Balkh, before their further threefold migration, namely, to Saptasındbu, to Iran, and to Mitaani,30 and when such religio mythological concepts as those of Asura Ahura and Soma Haoma were also evolved And, whatever the original character of Vedic Agni, there is little doubt that he soon came to be regarded as the centre of that cult so far as Indra was concerned There are many common points in the&#xA;27 Gesch der griech Sprache 162 ff 28 Religious Experience of the Roman People, 73-79 29 Cultus of Greek Slales V, 364&#xA;30 (I have slightly modified my carlier VICw in the regard I now tunk that the migration to M tagni ( Anatolia) must have been latted to a few groups of adventurers from among the ancestor of the Vedic Indians and that this migration must have occurred afier the separation of the Ira. Duan Aryans and the Indian Aryans ]&#xA;310&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;sacrificial ritunl of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians, though, it may be incidentally pointed out, the Vedic ritual ex hibited, in course of time, very complex and claborate ramifica tions This being so, it is rather strange that a linguistic counter part of such a common Vedic word as agni should not occur prominently in the Avestan language 31 The Avestan cult which corresponds to the Vedic Agni cult centres round Āthar And it us interesting to notc that a form closely related to the Avestan word athar occurs in the RV, in a solitary instance, namely, Vedic atharyu, which is an epithet of Agni (cf vil 1 1) It has been rightly pointed out that the word atharyu is related to the word atharian in the same way as riajul, suninaju, and yaj u are related respectively to rtavan, suminävan, and yajvan 12 Accordingly, *arhar 1 to be regarded as the hypothetical base from which derivatives atharyu and athan an are formed There can be little doubt that this bypothetical Vedic *athar is the same as the Ave. stan athar Athar, it may be presumed, denotes a religio magi cal fluid or potence (more or less similar to asu,93 the only difference perhaps being that asn is a cosmic concept while athar is a ritualıṣtıc one) According to the peculiar primitive ideo logy, the sacrificial fire is looked upon either as possessing such magica) potence (atharyu ) or as itself being that magical potence (athar) - both the notions implying the same thing in the ulti mate analysis Atharvan is then the priest who is believed to possess such religio magical potence But Agni himself is some times called Atharvan (cf VIII 9 7) This is similar to what we have already seen, namely, that the Angirases are priests but that Agni also is called Angiras&#xA;The interpretation of athar, which has been given here, seems to receive confirmation from another Vedic passage in the eighth verse of RV IV 6, which is an Agni hymn, Agni, instead of being called atharyu, is referred to as atharyo na dania&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;like the&#xA;31 Incidentally at may be noted that the name Agni docs not occur even on the Mitanni tablets&#xA;32 OLDENBERG Noten II, 1-2 33 Sec Asura Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;, publ shed elsewhere in this Volume&#xA;ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY&#xA;311&#xA;taoth of a certain female animal, which is supposed to embody the athar potencc &amp;quot; Various views have been put forth on the question as to which particular animal is intended here For 10 stancc, PISCHEL suggests that the animal must be the elephant 34 Some scholars, on the other hand, think of a wild boar, while others of a hrsnamrgi But, evidently, the animal referred to 10 this context must be one which belongs to the sphere of some ancient cult Such a one could very well be a horse The facts that the mare Vispalā is called atları (I 112 10), that Dadhyan Atharvana is supposed to have had a horse head, and that the horse plays an important role in such rites as the pra argja and the agnicılı seem to support such an assumption&#xA;As is well known, at one stage in the history of ancient India, sacrifice became the symbol of the Vedic Aryan culture and Agni came to be recognised as the symbol of sacrifice In this sense, Agni was often regarded as the central character in the great drama of the Aryan expansion in India This is, for instance, what we scc in the legend of Gotama Rābūgana and Videgha Mäthava, who, according to ŚPBr I 4 1 10 ff, were the pioneers of the Aryanisation of Eastern India as I sometimes think that, in this historical context, Agoi se assumed, as it were, his original role It has been already pointed out that Agn was ongioally conceived as dūra, as the covoy of the gods, as the Successful intermediary between gods and men la historical times, Agni again became duia, the envoy of Vedic culture, the vanguard of Aryanisation, the successful intermediary between the Aryans and the non Aryans&#xA;[ First publiskeel.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ASURA VARUNA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxical as it may seem, one will all the same be justified in saying that the Vedic researches have been the earliest and the richest among the indological researches and still the unsolved Vedic problems are the greatest in number among the indologi cal problems Particularly the field of Vedic mythology cannot be said even now to have been fully and satisfactorily exploited Varuṇa, for example is the most august and greatly elevated divinity in the pantheon of Vedic gods and still his essential character remains enigmatic This paradox may appear to be still more striking! What is it that gave Varuṇa the exalted position which he holds in the Rgveda (RV)? Why, in spite of the comparatively small number of hymns dedicated to his praise, is he regarded, by the side of Indra, as the greatest of the gods of the RV? Why, again in certain cases, is he represented as being far superior to Indra - sometimes even as the God among gods?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;APPENDIX&lt;br&gt;&#xA;INDO EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY - SOME NOTES&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Comparative mythology is a natural extension of com parative linguistics A comparative study of the various laoguages of the wide region extending from Ireland in the west to India jo the east led to the assumption first of a common Indo-European (IE) language as the ancient ancestor of all those languages, and subsequently of a common IE people, who spoke that language, and of a common IE culture, particularly of common IE scugion and mythology Understandably enough, the study of Vedic language and Vedic religion and mythology served almost as the starting point of the two disciplines of comparative lingule stics and comparative mythology However, in the early years of the history of Vedic philology in the West, scholars like BOPP, BOHLEN, and BENFEY are seen to have evinced greater interest in the language of the Veda than in the religion and my thology of the Veda, though we do come across such stray speculations relating to comparative mythology as that Sāra meyau in the Rgieda are identical with Greek Kerberos, that Dionysos is to be understood as the joint divinity of dyu (day) and miś (night) (both these suggestions by BENFEY), and that the legend of the Panis and the cows is comparable to the myth of Cacus ard Evander (suggested by F ROSEN) Exen ROTH, who may be said to have inaugurated the era of critical Vedic scholarship with his worth 2x Litteratus wd Geschichte des Weda (1846), did not occupy lumself to any appreciable extent&#xA;1 Thesc notes were prepared for a paper which I was invited to present at the Indo Soviet Symposium on &amp;quot; Ethnic problems of the early bistory of the peoples of Central Asia and lacia in the second millennium BC, held at Dushanbe, USSR, on October 17 22, 1977 It was intended that these potes would be developed into a full rescarch paper after the reaction to them of the participants in the Symposuim had become known Unfortunately, however, for personal reasons, I could not attend the Symposium at Dushanbe&#xA;352&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;with comparative mythology as such It is Adalbert KUHN who must be regarded as the true pioneer of comparative mythology with special reference to the Veda KUHN believed that, just as the JE peoples derived their respective languages from a common IE language, they also derived most of their mythological concepts from a common IE mythology He further believed that the etymologies of the names of the various Vedic gods provided ample material for identifying the IE elements in Vedic mythology In other words comparative linguistics and comparative mytho logy went hand in hand And, thirdly, he believed that most of the Vedic (and, therefore, IE) gods were personifications of natural powers and phenomena MAX MULLER also was an ardent exponent of this very kind of comparative mythology and based his theories about Vedic mythology on the three assumptions set forth by KUHN For instance, MAX MULLER accepted the equations Sārameyau = Hermeias, Saramā = Helena, Saranyu = Erionys, Parjanya=Perkunas (Lith), Usas=Eos, Bhaga=Bogu (old Slav ), Väta = Wotan, Vak = Vox, etc In bis Gifford Lectures on Anthropologica) Religion delivered at the University of Glasgow in 1891, MAX MULLER uttered these momentous words &amp;ldquo;If I were asked what I consider the most important dis covery which has been made during the nineteenth century with respect to the ancient history of mankind, I should say it was the simple etymological equation Sanskrit Dyaus-Pitar = Greek Zeus Pater = Latin Jupiter = Old Norse Tyr&amp;rdquo; One can hardly think of a more eloquent simultaneous glorification of the two disciplines of comparative linguistics and comparative mytho logy&#xA;The nineteenth century witnessed the rise of several academic disciplines (including archaeology ), but the major contribution of that century must, indeed, be regarded as having been the con cept of an IE language family (Incidentally, it was Thomas YOUNG who, in 1813, introduced the term &amp;ldquo;IE: while reviewing Johano ADELUNG&amp;rsquo;s work Mithridates ) The view has, no doubt, been expressed from time to time, by linguisticians like TRUBETZKOY, SOLTA, PISANI, and ALLEN, that the assumption&#xA;INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY&#xA;353&#xA;of a single unitary Ur IE is by no means necessary for explaining the IE language family But, as THIEME has rightly pointed out, the IE languages have too many similarities to be explained by anything other than a common genetic origin&#xA;Language is regarded as the most potent source for the study of a culture Language, according to KEARY, “holds within it far better than do tumuli or weapons, or articles of pottery or woven stuffs or ornaments, the records of long past times” CHILDE confirms this by stating that “language, albeit an abs traction, is yet a more subtle and pervasive criterion of indivi duality than the culture-group formed by comparing flints and potsherds of the &amp;lsquo;races&amp;rsquo; of skull measures &amp;quot;&#xA;This view clearly smacks of a partiality for the study of language as against archaeology The obvious limitations of linguistics must not be lost sight of&#xA;(2) A kind of reaction against the approach to Vedic mythology exclusively from the point of view of comparative mythology was but to be expected John MUIR, for instance, in the fifth volume of his Original Sanskrit Texts (1872), seemed to insist on Vedic religion and mythology being studied primarily from the Vedic sources, the comparative methods being utilised, if at all, only secondarily Abel BERGAIGNE also was generally averse to the methods of comparative mythology which had been so much overworked by KUHN and MAX MULLER The my thology of the Vedic Aryans was, according to him, closely con nected with their peculiar sacrificial cult which showed hardly any TE influence HILLEBRANDT also firmly believed that Vedic mythology and Vedic ritual were essentially inseparable He fur ther insisted that etymology, even if correct (and one could not be too sure of its correctness&amp;rsquo;), was mythologically useless be cause the meaning which it furnished was so general that it rarely gave any sure clue to the character of a Vcdic god Similarly, though OLDENBERG had no objection to individual Vedic gods being traced back to tbeir IE forms, he rightly cautioned that in that connection one must free opeself from the realm of mere&#xA;45&#xA;354&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;etymology According to OLDENBERG, Vedic religion must be viewed essentially and primarily as an Indian religion and not as a mere modification of IE religion He also emphasised the anthropological and ethnological factors in the development of&#xA;Vedic religion and mythology&#xA;(3) Though MACDONELL, BLOOMFIELD, and VON SCHR OEDER sought to revive the methods of comparative mythology in the study of Vedic religion and mythology, it came to be strongly reasserted (for instance, by PISCHEL and GELDNER ) that the Rgveda was predominantly an Indian document, that comparative linguistics was not necessarily a safe guide, and that the gulf between the earliest culture of the IE peoples of Europe and that of the Vedic age was such that no amount of phonetic equations could bridge it The unwarranted emphasis on the JE elements ia Vedic religion and mythology and the method of mere etymologising had consequently to be given up There also be came evident a growing tendency against the naturalistic inter pretation of Vedic mythology Among other tendencies which became prominent besides anti naturalism may be mentioned the awareness of the prevalence in Vedic religion of what might be called the ideology of primitive magic and the recognition of the non Aryan (non IE) elements 10 Vedic mythologyINDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC

mentioned the awareness of the prevalence in Vedic religion of what might be called the ideology of primitive magic and the recognition of the non Aryan (non IE) elements 10 Vedic mythology&#xA;(4) Such was the state of things when, nearly forty years ago, the discipline of comparative IE mythology was revived, but on different lines It has been pointed out that, instead of carry ing out minute historical research on the detailed development of the individual deities by forging links on the basis of sheer ety mological speculations and thereby patching up a ragged image composed of aimless bits of evidence, the new trends focussed attention on pattern and structure In other words, mythology was now studied in a structuralist way rather than in an &amp;lsquo;ato mistic&amp;rsquo; way The emphasis had shifted from lexical analogues 10 structural similarities The following principal approaches may be mentioned as representing these new trends in comparative IE mythology&#xA;INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY&#xA;355&#xA;(a) The Vienna scholars like KOPPERS aver that the IE problem is not just a problem of linguistics and archaeology but that it is also a problem of ethnology and religion-history The religious patterns develop in conformity with the levels of culture For instance, following W SCHMIDT, KOPPERS suggested that, while cattle served as the

in the Rgvedic pan theon and of its prc history TOPOROY has investigated the gods as they arc enumerated in The Russian Priniary Chronicle, in the Igor Talc, and in various other works with special reference to the ancient Slavonic pantheon (and not to culiemerization) and his&#xA;856&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;postulated the equations Stribogủ = Varuṇa Mitra, Perunnŭ = Indra, and Volosů = Asvinau He and ELIZARENKOVA have brought out the typological similarity of Usas to one concrete personage of the Baltic ( Lettish) folklore Damely, Usins (male) Usas is looked upon as not merely a poetic symbol of dawn but as a functional symbol having its roots in the mythology common to the Indo Iranians and the Balts Mention is also made in this connection of the cow symbolism which was so common among both these peoples&#xA;A reference may further be made here to some other views of Soviet scholars relating to comparative JE mythology In connection with the cow symbolism, attention is drawn to the related concepts Lithuanian daina Avestan daēna, and Vedic dhena (dhenu, dhı) suggesting the close association of ritual aad liturgy with the cow symbolism so characteristic of Usas Inciden tally, the cow symbolism is said to have been fairly prominent in Slavonic marriage etc A typological study of Vedic Usas and Lettish Usins is said to prove that two comparable and isomorph figures appear in Vedic mythology and Lettish folklore ELIZA RENKOVA suggests that Agpi and Aśvins represent incomplete correspondences of Usins viewed as a solar figure TOPOROV and IVANOV speak of Byelorussian reflexion of a group of IE words connected with the storm god cult They point to Byelorussian linguistic and mythological parallel to Vedic Parjanya Studying the correlation between Indra and Varuṇa ELIZARENKOVA puts forth the hypothesis concerning the pre RV state, when the level of magic power represented by Mitra Varuṇa must have modelled all the three functions of gods (cf DUMEZIL) IVANOV draws attention to the ancient Indian myth of primeval names giving and its parallel in the Greek tradition, while TOPOROV tries to reconstruct the world egg&amp;rsquo; myth&#xA;(e) The discipline of comparative mythology has, in recent years, again come into its own, thanks mainly to the prolific efforts of Georges DUMÉZIL It is claimed that this new compa rative IE mythology seeks to unravel and define the conceptual structures common to the religious and social organization of the&#xA;INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY&#xA;357&#xA;early historical and pre literate IE-speaking people It is further claimed that the sociological approach, initiated by DUMÉZIL and zealously sponsored by WIKANDER, DE VRIES, and PUIIVEL, not only draws on the philological speculations of the past 150 years, but also incorporates the structuralist mode of thought of this century in such fields as linguistics, anthropology, folklore, and history of religion in a sense, DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;S methods are said to reflect the fusion of comparativist and sociological traditions&#xA;DUMÉZIL starts from the Durkhelmian functional relation ship between social and sacred phenomena and arrives at his conception of tripartite division of IE social organization into priests, warriors, and food producers (that is, peasantry and arti sans) as the keystont of a common ideology wbich was a wide spread and unique trait in ancient Rome, Iran and India and which recurred also among the early Germans and Celts The conception of a social structure based on the distinction and hierarchisation of three functions gave rise to the threefold mythology in this trifupctional mythological pattern, DUMÉZIL speaks of (1) the top level of joint sovereigoty&amp;rsquo;, the magico-religious aspect of which is represented by Vedic Varuṇa, Roman Jupiter, and Germa nic Odia and the juridical aspect of which is represented by Vedic Mitra, Roman Dius Fidius, and Germanic Tyr, (11) the second level of &amp;lsquo;warrior&amp;rsquo;, which is represented by Vedic Indra ( Vedic Indra, it is sometimes suggested, represents the chivalrous aspect of this level and Rudra the fronzıcd aspect ), Roman Mars, and Germanic Thor, and (111) the third level of&amp;rsquo; fertility, wealth, nourishment, reproduction, etc &amp;rsquo; represented by Vedic Asvipau, Roman Qurious, and Germanic Freyja, Frey, Njord, etc DUMÉZIL further extends his scheme to Celtic and Scandioavian mythology and folklore He also speaks of other aspects of triplicity such as 10 justice, war, and famine&#xA;Among DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;s other mythological equations within this framework are Apām napat=Old Irish god Nechtan, Usas= Roman Mater Matula, Roman Angerona=Vcdic goddess of short days (RV V 40 5-8), Aditi=Fortuna Primigenia, Lua Mater=divine cliaracter of Nirti, Aryaman=Heros Eremon of&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;the Irish folk tales, Viṣṇu=Scandinavian Vidarr Incidentally, DUMÉZIL establishes the relationship between language and cul ture as a genctic rather than a generic model&#xA;(f) Some other recent studies in comparative JE mythology have brought out the following points (1) Various springtime festivals among the IC pcopics arc shown to be similar (MANN) (12) Satires in Greek, Celtic Germanic, and Vedic poetry indi cate that the IE social behaviour was motivated more by a sense of public reputation than by the concept of private guilt ( WARD ) (111) The Indo Europeins envisioned the sky as a vault of stone, cf Sk aśman, sky and stone, Avestan asman, Lithuanian akmuo, Slavic kamien, Gothic hininis (But did the IE folk kaow stone vaults?) (iv) Water played a significant role in the burial rites of the IEs of the metal ages (v) The IE notion of society encom passed men as well as animals (Cf wro-peku, durpada-catuspada, also gotra) (yi) The Hittite word pankus would suggest that Vedic pañca ( as for instance, in pañca janah) had the sense of &amp;ldquo;totality (vi) Hellenic Hermes and Vedic Pusan represent a transposition into mythology and religion of the exchange and reciprocity (But it is Paon who is usually identified with Pusan ) (yil! ) RV (X 39 3), Videvdat (7 44), and Pındartc ode ( 5th cent BC) seem to suggest that among the lEs there must have existed three classes of medical specialists (correspondiog to the three social classes ) namely, those who cured by means of spells (for priestly class) those who cured by means of knives (for warrior class) and those who cured by means of herbs (for farmers, etc ) On account of the peculiar agglomerating&amp;rdquo; tendency of the Veda, these three categories of medical specialists are united in the figure of Asvipau (1x) The peculiarly close relationship bet ween the Vedic and the Baltic ideologies is due to the conservatism and archaic character of the latter in respect of language and way of life (x) The Vedic samlada suhtas, the Brāhmaṇa legends, and the post Vedic epic motifs have clear counterparts in Irish sagas&#xA;(5) Out of the various new approaches in comparative IE&#xA;INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY&#xA;359&#xA;one which is perhaps most aggressive a a veritable independent tradition in comparative mythology, may be subjected to a brief critical examination It has been rightly pointed out that cultural reconstruclion, and proto ethno science in particular, must take account of the up-to date information from the relevant humanistic and natural sciences DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;S work based on Durkheimian theory, which latter, incidentally, is out of date, is said to represent a Degative example It has been further pointed out that much of DUMEZIL&amp;rsquo;s theoretical superstructure depends overly on highly abstract conceptions Again, DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;S assection that the tripartite social division did not originally exist among the peoples of antiquity who were not IE is difficult to accept Can “tripartition” be proved to be uniquely IE? Can it not be regarded as having been universally dictated by nature of things? According to BROUGH, for instance, ancient Jewish history provides us with not one but two distinct series of persons and events which are illuminated by a similar tripartite analysis&#xA;There is also a wide spread tendency in popular literature towards a threefold characterization The &amp;rsquo;three functions can thus by no means be said to be typically IE It cannot be even proved with certainty that this social stratification was common to all IE peoples While Indo-Ir evidence points to three rigidly defined classes, Roman evidence indicates only three general modes of activity (The contention that, though tripartition is an obvious division of responsiblities within a community, its formal secog Dion is specifically IE is hardly valid Similarly, had tripartition been the core of the IE society and pantheon, the lexical charac&#xA;ter of the terms relating to it would have been preserved&#xA;And even if it is granted that the IE social organization was composed of “three functions &amp;ldquo;, does it necessarily follow that the gods of the RV (among others) were “collective representa tions” of this social structure? Society cannot be the &amp;lsquo;stuff&amp;rsquo; of the supernatural The way of life may define the character of religion and mythology.&#xA;The hierarchical order of the three functions has varied in DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;s various explanations The same god is assigued&#xA;360&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;different functions or more than one function (cf Zeus, Mithra ) in different contexts There is no unanimity of views among the Dumezilians in the matter of assigaing fupctions to dividities is the mutability of DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;s own views not indicative of the instability of his position?&#xA;But the most glacing defect of DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;s theory is that his conception of functional tripartition is not supported by Vedic evidence For instance, lodra, as portrayed in Vedic mythology, has no real counterpart in any other IE mythology or language When DUMEZIL speaks of Mitra as the sovereign in bis clear, regal, calm, benevolent, sacerdotal aspect, and of Varuṇa as the sovereign 10 his assailant, sombre, inspiring, violent, terrible, war like aspect, one fails to understand on wbat textual evidence he has based his theory of such marked contrast between the two gods One would search in vain for Rgvedic passages in support of the long array of adjectives which the French mythologist has used Similar is the case in regard to DUMEZIL&amp;rsquo;s contention that horse is heavily connected with the Varuṇa half of sovereignty but absent from the Mitra half While suggesting the corres pondence between Scandinavian Vidart and Vedic Viṣṇu, DUMÉZIL seems to connect the word vsnu woh the preposition vi (denoting the idea of separation), when, in fact, that word has to be derived from the root vi (=to fly) indicating the original bird form of Viṣṇu DUMÉZIL refers to the Roman ritual but does not take into account the Vedic ritual which, incidentally, has developed independently of the IE 1ofuence Indeed, while explicating the character of a Vedic deity, he does not consider the entire Vedic material concerning that deity but selects only what suits his theory.&#xA;As for some other points made by DUMÉZIL, it may be point ed out that the Vedic evidence does not support the assumption that Bhaga and Aryaman are minor sovereigns under Mitra, and Daksa and Amsa under Varuṇa There is also no clear reference in the Mahabharata to the three sins of Indra ( which are made to correspond with those of Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome, qud the Norse hero Starkadr) having been responsible for the&#xA;INDO EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY&#xA;361&#xA;birth of Yudhisthira (through the teas which Indra had lost on account of his first sin), of Bhima and Arjuna (through the lost vigorous manhood), and of Nakula and Sahadeva (through the lost beauty )&#xA;The fact that ancient Greek mythology reflects but few IE traits would seem scriously to vitiate DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;s theory For, as has been pointed out, despite the relative abundance of documen tary evidence as to the character of Grcek religion and mythology, it has proved all but impossible to sort out from it any overall structure comparable to the one which DUMEZIL claims to have discovered in Indo-Irapian, Italic, Norse, and Celtic traditions Ons really wonders as to what extent one can at all impute to the profoundly localized Greek and Indian traditions the IE mytholo gical inheritances And, out of the three factors, namely, diffu sion, independent invention, and common IE heritage, why are the first two altogether ignored ?&#xA;Further, there is hardly any element of “religiosity” in the tripartite functional mythology One may also ask whether the religio mythological pattern of a people would remain unchanged in spite of that people s essentially changing environments DUMÉZIL seems to regard mythology as being static It is, in deed, difficult to believe that any mythological pattern could survive the various inevitable changes in social life DUMEZIL derives evidence indiscriminately from myth, ritual, epic, legend, folklore, history, etc How far is it proper to explain obviously historie cal events 10 terms of tripartition (as DUMEZIL sometimes does )? Further, DUMÉZIL often establishes correspondences on slender basis eg legend of Mudgala and Roman rules of divinanon, Viṣṇu and the Iranian entity Raśpu, Maruts and Zoroastrian Fravaśis, Roman Fordicidia (involving the sacrifice of a pregnant cow) and the sacrifice of astapadi in the Raja suya, circular temple in Rome and the circular manner in which Vedic sacrificial fires are set up DUMÉZIL&amp;rsquo;s methods are often procrustian and the correspondences postulated by him quite tenuous&#xA;46&#xA;362&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;(6) Conclusion (1) Comparative linguistics (particularly etymologies of the names of the Vedic gods or mere phonetic cor respondences) should not be made the starting point of any study of Vedic religion and mythology Linguistics may be employed by way of corroborative evidence (or as negative evidence, for in stance, in order to show that the words varuna and ouranos are not derived from the same root) (11) Comparative mytholog too has but limited scope Indeed, Vedic mythology is mucl farther removed from IE mythology than Vedic language from I! language (111) One must guard against mistaking universal concepts for IE concepts (1) Exclusively naturalistic inter pretation of Vedic mythology is not warranted by Vedic evidence (y) The Dumezılıan pattern of functional tripartition provide too narrow a frame to contain all the variety and complexity o Vedic mythology (vi) The importance of anthropological and ethnological factors in the formation and development of mytho logy should not be underestimated (vii) Vedic mythology 1 by no means a static phenomenon It is essentially an evolutiona ry or growing mythology Its character is determined by th Vicissitudes in the life of the Vedic Aryaas (Vit) The IE ele ments in Vedic mythology as it emerges from the Vedic texts ar few, feeble, and faint Compared to the mythologies of som other IE peoples, the development of some of these element appears to have been arrested in Vedic mythology (as in the cas of Dyaus), while the nature of some others has undergone conspicuous change on account of the peculiar influences to whic they had been exposed (as in the case of Asvinau)&#xA;The concept of Dyaus may be regarded as having been trul IE in origin Known differently in the mythologies of differer IE peoples as Zeus, Deipatyros, Ziu, Diespater, Jupiter, Tyr, etc this god was originally associated with heavenly and diviae light As such he was also linked with the idea of authority in coafor mity with the patriarchal IE society, he was called “father However, Dyaus was not elevated to the exalted position of th supreme god like his other counterparts The reason for thi seems to have been this. Dyaus represents one aspect of what maINDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY&#xA;363&#xA;be called cosmic religion. Among the proto-Aryans, there evoly ed another aspect of cosmic religion, Damely, that related to Rta and Varuṇa, which may be characterised as being peculiar to them and which may be presumed to have arrested the mythological development of Dyaus,&#xA;The IEs had no Mother-Goddess as such who stood above the other divinities, though it is suggested that the fact that the words for earth in IE languages are usually feminine (Sk, prilivi, Gk. se, chion, Latin terra) may be indicating the idea of Mother Earth.&#xA;Ağvinau provide perhaps the most striking justification for comparative IE mythology. The Divine Twins of the Vedic, Greek, and Baltic traditions (respectively, Aśvinau-Divo Napātā, Dios Kouroi, and Dieva Dēli ( in Latvian ) and Dievo Suneliai 1 in Lithuanian) are related not only mythologically but also ctymologically. Germanic evidence is newly derived from the heroic epic, Kudrun. The Iranian counterparts of Alvinau are believed to be Haurvatāt and Ameretāt. (Incidentally, the Aresta has demon Nahaithya ( Nāsatya ). This is so presumably because all divinities associated with warfare and with horse have been Tejected by the Zoroastrian religion.) Strangely enougb, DUMÉZIL secs the reflection of the Divine Twias also in Romulus-Remus.&#xA;It is claimed that cach member of this Divine Pair has a distinctive character.&#xA;The peculiar Vedic development of the mythology of the Divine Twins is characterised by the concept of Aditi attended upon by two cavaliers (es pointed out by PRZYLUSKI) and of thic honcy-whip of Aśvinau,&#xA;Oac an speak of an IE prototype of horse-sacrifice; but the Vedic Afvamedha in its totality has to be viewed as an Indian de clopment on account of the inclusion in it of the elements of the pre-Aryap human sacrilicc. The parallclism between the Aśva. medha and the Roman October Equus is noteworthy. Also notc worthy is the sexual aspect of the ritc in Vedic and Celtic tradi. tions (Vodic: the queen and the horsc; Celtic : thc Ling and the&#xA;364&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;mare) Among the Gauls, the proper name Epomeduos (Aśva. medha) is attested&#xA;(1x) Vedic religion and mythology received their first distinc tive characterisation during the proto-Aryan period when the common ancestors of the Vedic Aryans, Iranian Aryans, and Anatolian Aryans lived together presumably in the region of Balkh The concept of Rta or cosmic order and the binder&amp;rsquo; gods Asura Varuṇa and Mitra, the Soma cult, and the peculiar fire cult are some of the principal exclusive features of the newly evolved &amp;lsquo;Aryan&amp;rsquo; religion&#xA;The fire cult of the proto Aryans, for instance, was different from the cult of Roman Vesta and Greek Hestia which latter was essentially the cult of the hearth It may be noted that in those traditions in which the linguistic cognates of the word agni are attested (Latin igns Slavonic ognis) the counterparts of the Agni cult are not to be met with In the Iranian tradition, on the other hand, the Agai cuit exists, but not the linguistic coge nate of the word agni The Avestan word for fire, namely, alar, may, however, be connected with Vedic Agor&amp;rsquo;s epithet atharyu (x) The migration from Balkh to Saptasındhu and the early settlements in Saptasindhu, which had been beset with many im pedements (1rtrani) natural and human, gave rise to the mytho logy of irirahan Indra — the human hero who was transformed into a war god This was the result of mythologisation of history Understandably enough, the Rgveda, a major part of which cons titutes a saga of Aryan conquest and colonisation, is dominated by the figure of Indra (xi) Side by side with the hieratic religion centering round Varuṇa, Indra, Agni, and Soma, there existed several popular religious cults among the Vedic people Simuarly, in their new exwronments, the Yadio Aryans woofronted some pre Vedic non Aryan religious cults, which were widely spread and deeply rooted and which tliey could neither ignore nor over whelm They accommodated these popular and non Aryan cults into the framework of their religion and mythology Tlus becomes evident, for instance, in the mythology relating to Visou and Rudra. The obviously artificial association of the popular gods&#xA;INDD-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY&#xA;365&#xA;with Indra, who, as it were, served as the philosophers&amp;rsquo; stone in respect of the hieratic elevation of these gods, the tendentious suppression or transformation of somc of the original traits of the popular and non-Aryan religious ideologies, and the solarization of the originally non-solar divinities are some of the features of this process of hierarchisation of popular cults.&#xA;[Tirst published: V.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PÜSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD OF THE VEDA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vedic gods often seem to possess very complex characters The descriptions in the Vedic hymns usually bring forth so many different traits of a single god that it is not always easy to deter mine the original nature and trace the later development of his personality In this respect Pusao may be regarded as being a particularly curious and enigmatic figure in the pantheon of Vedic gods This god is celebrated alone in ciglit hymns of the Rgveda, with Indra in one hymn, with Soma in one, and is mentioned with several other deities in about fifty eight hymns, his name thus being mentioned about 120 times He is also glorified in the Atharvaveda and the Bralimanas, and seems to have played a distinctive role in the Vedic ritual The picture of Pusan derived from all these manifold literary and ritual references is, indeed, puzzlingly composite&#xA;Even a casual glance at the statistical analysis of the RV references to Pusan&amp;rsquo; will suffice to bring out prominently a peculiar feature of the way in which this god has been celebrated in that Veda Out of the eight complete hymns glorifying Pusan, five occur in the sixth mandala of the RV which primarily reflects the literary and religious activities of the clan of the Bhāradvājas That portion of the sixth mandala (hymns 53-58, hymn 48 15-19), which is dedicated exclusively to Pusan, is so conspicuous that HILLEBRANDT chooses to call it a small Pusan-sambitā&amp;rsquo;in itself 2 This fact cannot be regarded as just an accident On the contrary it seems to indicate that the Pusan cult was a special possession of the family of the Bhāradvājas No discussion regarding the essential character of Pusan can be said to be complete and conclusive, unless the real significance of this impor&#xA;Pusan 1 mentioned 36 times in the sixth mandala, while hic is referred 10 3 times in the second, 5 tubes in the third, 3 times in the fourth (at none of these places in the vocative ), 8 times in the filth, 6 times in the seventh, 6 times in the cighth, and more often in the first and the tenth mandalas,&#xA;2 Vedische Afythologie II, 330&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;tant feature of the Puṣan religion in the RV is clearly explained Equally significant is the fact that the Panis are most prominently mentioned in the sixth mandala and that Pusan is the god who is specially invoked to put down those nasty mischief mongers of the Vedic times Another point that would strike a student of Vedic mythology is that Pusan is coupled rather predominantly only with two gods from the Vedic panicon, namely, Indra (VI 57) and Soma (II 40) A critical study of the passages referring to Indrā pusanau (11152 7, VI 57) leads one to the conclusion that originally the Indra religion and the Pusan religion were in independent religious cults and that a special effort was made to bring them together similar appears to have been the case also with regard to the coupling together of Soma and Puṣan The traces of this artificial blendıog together of two distinct religious cults are too clear in the RV to be missed The anthropomorphic traits in the descriptions of Pusan are also noteworthy Vedic re ferences to Pusan&amp;rsquo;s braided hair (VI 55 2 ) and beard (X 26 7), to his awl (VI 53 6 ) and goad (YI 53 9), to his special food, karambha (VI 56 1), to his car being driven by goats instead of horses (I 138 4, VI 55 3, 4, 57 3)- all these present before us quite a distinctive personality, that is to say, the personality of a god belonging to a world more or less different from that of many Vedic gods as we know them But by far the greatest emphasis is laid by the Vedic poets on the prominent role played by Pusan in the pastoral life of the people Indeed, Pusan is the only Vedic god who has been given the epithet paśupā, protector of the cattle (VI 58 2) durectly (and not in comparisons) He increases the cattle (VI 53 10, 54 5-6, 56 5) and brings back those that have strayed (VI 54 7, 10) He eats the food which is common among the pastoral communities (VI 56 1 ) and bears the goad (VL 53 9 ) which is typical of a shepherd as a cowherd&#xA;It is said of him that he commands large amounts of wealth (1 89 6, VIII 4 15) and bestows great bounty (VI 584) On his worshippers, particularly in the form of the increase of cattle&#xA;Another characteristic feature of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality is his close association with paths. He is the lord of paths and helps&#xA;PŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;93&#xA;the nomadic tribes on their ways (X 17 3-6) As has been pointed out, Pusan knows the paths, shows the paths, leads on the right paths, and guards the people and cattle against missing the ways 3&#xA;Apart from all this, as is quite common with Vedic mythology in general, Pusan also is endowed with features connected with brightness and splendour He is brought into contact with several phenomena of light (VI 48 17, 56 3, 58 I) Expressions are used with reference to Pusan which are similar to those which are used with reference to Agnis and Surya 5 The part which he is made to play in the Suryā myth (X 85 26 ) is, indeed, very peculiar&#xA;This brief statement would give the impression that Pusan was a god of intrinsically complex personality, characterised as it is by apparently inconsistent and unconnected traits So far scholars have either cmphasised only one sjogle aspect of this god&amp;rsquo;s personality by making him the sun god, or the god of paths,e etc, thereby almost overlooking his other traits which do not fit in with their respective theories, or, otherwise, they have tried to strike a compromise by making him represent, from the very beginning an inherently mixed conception such as that of the beneficent power of the sun manifested chiefly as a pastoral deity” As a matter of fact, we have to approach such problems&#xA;$ Cť OLDENBERC Rdl, 234 4 CF III 62 9 and X 187 4, VI 55 4-5 and . 3 3 5 Cr vi 55 4-5 and I 115 2&#xA;6 The similarity of Puṣan in various respects, 10 Hermes ( LEITII RPIU, 107) Pan (W SCHULZE, KZ 42 81, 37+), and Thor (GUNTERT.

The solar theory is mainly based on certain epithets of Pusan, which are sugges tive of light and splendour As a matter of fact, however, out of the scicral cpithets attributed to Pusan, only one, namely, aghrni (VI 48 16, 53 3,55 1,3), may be said to be suggestive of the sun god Indeed, BLOOMFIELD claims for this god a clearly solar character on the strength of that very ancient epithet, aghrni (glowing, being specifically used with reference to him 13 But it will be seen that this cpithet is quite general in sense and may be made to indicate any resplendent divinity For example it is used with reference to Agni also (VIII 60 20) This single epithet cannot, therefore, bc regarded as a decisive proof regarding Pusan&amp;rsquo;s fundamental character ! If this epithet had been really characteristic of Pusan, why should it have been dropped out in later literature? The very fact that it disappears completely in later times would suggest that it was only superficially attributed to Pusan Further, the bright aspect of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality which is referred to in some stray cases (VI 48 17, 58 1) may be regarded as being indicative merely of the light symbolism, which is commonly superimposed by Vedic poets on their gods Bright ness and splendour are considered to be thic external manifestations of divine power Puson&amp;rsquo;s part in the Suryi myth has also been put forth as strongly supporting the solar theory But that whole myth is so puzzling that, by itself, it does not offer any substantial&#xA;A BAVOLO19-23, Paris, le rog 36.&#xA;12 C&amp;amp;A LAVOLON R iido trad du Sanktit 1848–51, Allment sur d. 21!! lugu analia Sord, Par 18.32 Var VuLLER, Irito. 112at cant it tru ? 197, Yarns 11 mdr Arbolv 3G, Romi in Plt under en VADONILL SAI, 37, hum RPIU, 107&#xA;13 MLOOMTITLD The Rilner of the Irlar 172&#xA;14 It may also be noted that there considerable d Nerence of opinion Igarding the exact meaning of the word, 184 The word occur IS and in the Ri Sayama explans stadgatal (in hus commentary on the passages motioned above) os polst Annlit 23 13 ) and as dph (111 62 7) IA Au coumratory on t 198 4 on the other hand, he uri a KOY Cortik Ingre ministar Awas in lots #tou OITEVINO think that the curt tran ng of the word u nof certain (rel 29. n. 4) Trnum in blinkment to CHAWATY dc Dctrony intcrprets at 31 1 bent or &amp;rsquo; netow&#39;96&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;clue to solve the Pusan problem That myth points rather to Pusan&amp;rsquo;s having been included in it by way of an afterthought PERRY rightly suggests that this myth must be the result of the meeting of two different streams of legend, in one of which Pusan and in the other Surya plays the chief role It is also possible to explain the references to the mysterious relationships and to the motif of incest occurring in that myth on the assumption that certain elements of the original Pusan cult were integrated into that myth which was based on solar and light phenomena 18&#xA;Another piece of evidence produced by HILLEBRANDT? and PERRY18 jn support of the solar theory is the fact that Pusad is coupled with Soma both in the RV-Samhita (II 40 ) and in Vedic ritual 19 They argue that Soma represents the moon god and so Pusan must necessarily represent the sun god The very starting point of this seasoning is unconvincing The original nature of Soma was not lunar It will be shown later that this coupling together of Pusan and Soma is significant from quite a different point of view and forms an important stage in the evolution of the Pusan-religion In II 40, a reference is made to Pusan&amp;rsquo;s dwelling in heaven as well as to his wandering between the heaven and the earth ( also X 17 6) This is taken to indicate the sun&amp;rsquo;s daily journey from and back to heaven The fact that Pusan leads the dead from the earth to the other world (X 17 3 ) is also inter preted as supporting the above assumption 20 According to BLOOMFIELD, such references are typical of the familiar notion of the Vedic poets that the sun oversees everything 11 A critical examination of the Vedic passages cited above would, however, show that they are very casual references and do not at all point&#xA;15 Op atl, 243 16 For further elaboration of this point sce the sequel 17 HILLEBRANDT, I AI1, 332&#xA;18 PERRY (Op al) understands the dual divinity of II 20, namely, Somāpuṣanau, as representing the moun god and the sun god&#xA;19 CC NIS II 2 4&#xA;20 MACDOVELL (1 11 37 ) points to the further fact that in the post Vedic literature Pasan occasionally occurs as a name of the sun&#xA;21 BLOOMFIELD, Opel, 173.&#xA;sorua pe CS COOKEELESORIA DO 373&#xA;PUSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;97&#xA;Ir the essential function of Pusap The close association of Pusan with Ago (1 122 5, II 1 6, X 17 3 ) also cannot be said to be suggestive of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s solar nature&#xA;The &amp;lsquo;increasc facilitating&amp;rsquo; faculty, which is prominent in Pusad s character, is again not exclusively solar On the other hand, assuming that the word, pūsan, really means Prospero&amp;rsquo; (cf BLOOMFIELD, The Religion of the Vedas, 170), it may reaso nably be asked why the sun god, alone among the Vedic gods, should be glorified with that title Parjanya and Maruts also are represented as conferring prosperity on mankind Therefore, Pusan&amp;rsquo;s increase facilitating faculty cannot by itself be a proof of his solar character It should also be noted that the prosperity conferred by Pusan is obviously connected with cattle, this fact cannot be satisfactorily reconciled with that god&amp;rsquo;s solar nature The sun&amp;rsquo;s power of 10creasing cattle is evidently not direct and natural ?! In one of the myths (VI 56 3 ) Pusan is described as loading the suns wheel on some hairy speckled animal Eise where (VI 55 2,56 2) hc is called a chariotcer par excellence&#xA;These references are said to be indicative of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s solar aspect, particularly as a solar charioteer But docs that not mean that Puṣan is here markedly distinguished from the sun god? There are several other passages where this distinction between the sun and Pusan is clearly brought out Pusan is called the messenger of the sun (VI 58 3 ) and is elsewhere mentioned as being different from the sun (e &amp;amp; VI 48 17): Further, it cannot be argued, on the strength of Pusans association with Savitr (V 81 5, X 139 1 ) and of the fact that the epithet agonya is peculiar to Savitr (1 110 3, IV 33 7) and Pusan (X 64 3)), that Pusan&#xA;22 kmit (RPI U, 107 ) compare Poran with the Iron fithra, who promotes the prosperity of cattle and brings lost animals home Atithra u, According to that scholar an almost undoubted tungod hc consequently argue that Papan also must be a sun god &amp;lsquo;Th s argumcut u baxu upon a dofinitely que onable concer uon of thras scntal personal ty (See • Asun ใณ&#xA;23 It has been asumed on the bras of Phan a close associat oa with the Afvat, that the former arcared in the sky with the Afrin very carly in the born og This (act us ford to be young agurt the solar theory&#xA;13&#xA;98&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;is an aspect of the sun-god, just as Savits is 21 It has been shown elsewhere25 that Savitr himself is essentially not a sun god Moreover, the reference in the Savitr-hymn (V 81 5), uta pūsä bhavası deva jāmabluh would rather suggest that Pusad is not basically connected with solar splendour but with paths and highways&#xA;The various Vedic passages referred to above cannot, there fore, be said to indicate the essential solar nature of Pūsan Many other objections may be raised against the solar theory Certain epithets like ajāśva and karambhäd, which are exclusively attri buted to Pusan,28 do not even distantly hint at his solar character Further the anthropomorphic traits of Pūsan, mentioned in the RV, though scanty, are sufficiently individualistic The braided hair and beard are hardly suggestive of the sun-god 27 The peculiarities with regard to Pusan&amp;rsquo;s food (VI 56 1), weapon (VI 53 5), car (VI 54 3 ) and the animal driving it (I 138 4; VI 55 3,4), as also his other mannerisms, are so life like and realistic that they completely banish out of account any possibility of a naturalistic interpretation of his personality 29 It is also difficult to explain satisfactorily, on the basis of the solar theory, the peculiar relation that seems to have existed between the Pusan-religion and the clan of the Bhāradvājas it may further be asked if Pusan was originally the sun god, what exactly could be the significance of his being coupled with Indra and Soma only and that too by way of an afterthought? What, again, is the special significance of the sun god alone being invoked to pupish the Panis? In the hymn, VIII 29, where the distinctive features of several Vedic gods are mentioned in the form of riddles, the&#xA;24 HOPKINS ( The Religions of India, 41, 47, 52 even goes to the extent of saying that Pusan and Savits are almost identical so fas as their names and functions are concerned&#xA;25 &amp;ldquo;New light on the Vedic god Savit?&amp;rdquo;, published elsewhere in this Volume&#xA;26 Sec supra&#xA;27 As kapardın and parupa, Pusan 19 supposed by certain scbolars, to be representing the original of Rudra : characteristics&#xA;28 Also cf MACDONELL, VA, 37&#xA;PŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;99&#xA;solar aspect of Paṣan is not even hinted at ( VIII. 29.6). Taking into account the special characteristics of the Vedic Pisan one does not feel inclined to accept the conclusion arrived at by ATKINS, who has made a fresh study of the Pūṣan-problem od the basis of all the available material on the subject, namely, that, when considered in the aggregate the Vedic references lead us to the assumption that Puṣan was primarily a sun-god. 9 As a matter of fact, the emphasis put by the Vedic poets on the traits of Puṣan&amp;rsquo;s personality other than those connected with light and splendour is so conspicuous that even the supporters of the solar theory tend towards modifying their theory in various ways. Püṣan is made to represent the sun god in different positions and capacities. But this, in itself, may be regarded as an indication of the inherently untenable character of that theory. Such variations of the solar theory no doubt exhibit considerable ingenuity on the part of their authors; but on critical examination they are found to be quite unconvincing.&#xA;GRASSMANN 50 for instance, makes Pūsan a god of prospe rity and growth related to the sun. SCHROEDERSI believes that Pūṣan was an original ancient sun.god bestowing bounty. While DE GUBERNATTS** and GRILL33 consider him to be speci fically the setting or the evening sun, FLENSBURG regards him as the sun acarest the carth, that is to say, the poon-sun 34&#xA;29. S. D.

Many other Vedic gods seem to play an equally – if not more - important role in pastoral life Morcover, It may be asked If this pastoral aspect is a later development of the basic solar character of Pusan, why has it ultimately dis appeared ? In later times we find that the traces of the bucolic aspect are quite indistinct As a matter of fact, those traits in Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality, which are supposed to have been the result of a later development, must be reasonably expected to be conspi cuously preserved That is, however, not the case&#xA;It cannot be denied that the Vedic poets have made an obvious attempt to endow Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality with some features connec ted with light and splendour But the above discussion leads one to the following conclusions Firstly, there is no clear evidence to show ibat Pusan represents a phenomenon of nature to Secondly, Pusan cannot at all be said to have originally represented a solar divinity In fact the light symbolism which is perceptible from the Vedic references to Pusan does not form an intrinsic and&#xA;42 See Also OLDEN DERC, OR &amp;ldquo;, 236 BERCAICNE (LRV II, 420-30 ) thinks that a complete explanation of Pisan, like that of Vippe, camot be

commonplace, and colourless for that Therefore, one may be justified in concluding further that the phenomena of light with which Pusan is associated in the Veda were introduced by way of an after thought and perhaps with some special purpose in view&#xA;It has already been noticed that the traits in the Pusan mytho logy connected with light and splendour are so ambiguous that they have given rise to doubts as to whether the bright aspect of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality indicates his solar nature or the lunar nature or the stellar nature SIECKE believes that Pusan was origipally&#xA;a moon divinity who later assumed the functions of a god of paths 43 HERTEL also seems to support this view 41 From the point of view of comparative mythology SIECKE assumes that the Similarity of Pusan with Hermes is undoubted 45 Accordiagly he regards both of them as moon gods As will be pointed out in the sequel, there are, indeed, certain characteristics in Pusan&amp;rsquo;s nature which appear to be unmistakably indicating bis lunar aspect It is also easily intelligible that the moon, and not so much the sun, should be brought into close contact with the lord ship of paths But to say that Pusan represents essentially and originally the moon god is quite unconvincing 46 On that assum&#xA;ption it would be difficult to explain why a moon god should be invested with the peculiar features which characterise the Pusan mythology As a matter of fact, all that has been said above against the solar theory may with equal cogency apply to other&#xA;43 See foot-note 39 44 J HERTEL, Betrage zur

paths But he says that SIECKE effort to identify Pufan with the moon god deserves attention&#xA;46 It seems that SIECKL has fallen a victm to a popular trend of mytholog cal study which sees the moon propunently manifesting himself at the back of all being and doing of a god Many important Vedic gods including Varuṇa Yame, and even Vuou were regarded as representing the moon goc It was claimed that the moon played the most predominant role in primitive mythology&#xA;PŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;103&#xA;theories seeking to make Pusan represent one or the other pheno menon of Light&#xA;GHOSH starts with the assumption that the physical nature of a large number of RV deities can be interpreted from the astro pomical and meteorological poiots of view On the basis of the obscure Suryā myth, he believes that Pusan appears in the heaven at night towards morning with Asvins, and goes away before sunrise He consequently identifies Pusan with the constellation Auriga of the northern hemisphere 47 Apart from the highly questionable Oature of the Süryā myth, it will be seen that GHOSH has altogether neglected other more prominent features of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s character 49 The same may be said to be the case with GHOSE, who makes Pusan a god of Light and Moisture-the two principles sustaining the universe 49 No attention seems to have been paid here either to Pusan&amp;rsquo;s antbropomorphic traits, or to his peculiar connection with paths and pastoral life in general Even a casual study of the Pusan samlità in the sixth mandala would suffice to show how untenable such theories are on the very face of them! There were periods in the history of Vedic mythological studics when the Vedic gods were exclusively made to represent either some natural phenomena - particularly connected with heaven and light -or some ritualistic conceptions Naturalistic and ritualistic traits are superimposed upon the original Vedic mythology in many cases &amp;ldquo;But a critical study of the Vedic mythology soon makes it clear that these traits cannot have constituted the intrinsic nature of the gods ja question A reference has already been made to BERGAIGNE&amp;rsquo;s view That scholar even goes to the extent of ultimately identifying Pusan with Soma 50 Neither Vedic texts nor Vedic ritualistic practices seem to substantiate this view it need hardly be added that many objections raised above against&#xA;47 1 N Crosu, JASBm, NS, 20 99-92 (particularly p 91 )&#xA;48 (On the basis of IV 57 6-7, B R KULEARNI suggests (DV Poldar Fil Tul, 1950 229-30 ) that the rise of Puṣan - the Revati naffairs &amp;ndash; was once cocval with and a goal for sowing what (sila) ]&#xA;49 See supra&#xA;50 opal, 420&#xA;104&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;the solar theory are applicable with equal force even in this connection&#xA;While dismissing the solar theory and the lunar theory51 as perfectly unsatisfactory, OLDENBERG emphasises yet another single aspect of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s character thereby ignoring the other ones 5&amp;rsquo; Pusan is seen to be active in several distinct capacities, But, according to OLDENBERG, the most characteristic function of this god is in connection with paths. He knows the paths and leads others safely on them (VI. 49.8). He guards men and cattle from going astray (VI. 54. 5-7). Those who are lost he brings back intact (I. 23. 13) Indeed, he knows where and how to find the lost things (I. 23 14; VI, 48, 15) OLDENBERG argues that the fundamental nature of a god&amp;rsquo;s being is to be determined primarily on the basis of his post original and most essential function. Pūsan is, therefore, a lord of paths, regarded as a distinct dividity by the Vedic poets and celebrated by them as such. According to OLDENBERG, Pūsan is connected with agriculture only so far as he sees that the furrows of the plough are in the right direction (IV, 57. 7). Hts connection with cattle also is restricted to his leading them on the right path. Püsan&amp;rsquo;s astrā is called paśusādhani (VI 53.9) OLDENBERG understands the word paśusādhani in the sense of leading the pasu on the right path&amp;rsquo; 5* The later development of this essential function of Pusan is to be seen in his being regarded as leading the bride, in a proper manner, from the father&amp;rsquo;s to the husband&amp;rsquo;s house&#xA;51. It 19 interesting to recall that OLDENBERG is usually in favour of the theory that the mood played a very prominent part in mythology It may also be noted that he identifies Varuṇa with the moon on the strength of a compara. tive study of Vedic and Semitic mythologies. Stecke too has referred to Semutic mythology in support of his theory that Pusan represents the moon god. But OLDENBERG finds SLECKE&amp;rsquo;s argumentation unconvincing. He also rejects V. HENRY&amp;rsquo;s vicw that AV VII 9 1 positively cstablishes Puṣan&amp;rsquo;s solar nature (Opal, 236, f n 4)&#xA;52 OLDENBERO, RAV, 234-37,&#xA;53 As against BERGAIONE who interprets pasusudhani as &amp;lsquo;procurog cattle (O 68, 424). OLDENBERG believes that the verb sudh is distinctive of Paṣan (VI 56 4-5, X. 26.4) and that it is appropriately connected with the god of patbs nncc sudhu as the standing epithet of path (Op. al, 234, f. n. !).&#xA;PÜSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;105&#xA;(X 85 26) Püsan is also described as leading the dead to the other world (X 17 3) Himself the lord of paths, Pusan is born on the way (X 17 6) OLDENBERG interprets Pusan&amp;rsquo;s epithet, vimuco napas, 10 two seases first, as the lord of lodging&amp;rsquo;?), and, secondly, as the deliverer par excellence&amp;rsquo; Both these concep tions are, according to him, promloent 10 Pusan s nature as the lord of paths Other features of the Pusan mythology, such as his being the messenger of the sun (VI 58 3 ) and his finding out Soma as well as Agnt, when they were lost (I 23 14, X 55), are also explained by OLDENBERG as supporting his theory Fur ther the connection of the lord of paths with the goat is quite natural because the goat is certainly the most sure footed animal In some Vedic passages ( 1 42, VI 534) Pusan is described as cleaning the paths of evil spirits, wolf, and highway robbers It is significant that in śānh GS II 14 9 he is represented as receiving offerings, in his capacity of the path finder, every morning and evening, on the threshold of the house So far as comparative mythology is concerned, OLDENBERG is of the opinion that Pusan 13 identical with Hermest and regards both of them as basically lords of paths That scholar even includes Pusan and Hermes, in this their original character, among such divinities as can be traced back to indogermanic antiquity&#xA;So far as OLDENBERG asserts that Pusan cannot be the personification of any nature phenomenon it is easy to accept his View But his theory that Pūsan&amp;rsquo;s nature as a path finder or a lord of paths is the basic conception underlying that god&amp;rsquo;s perso nality cannot possibly be accepted without challenge The very conception of a god of paths is so general that it is, indeed, dificult to imaginc that such a god could have ever been invested with distinct anthropomorphic traits Pusan is represented in the Veda with a distinct individuality Why should god of paths be speciücally characterised as a haramblad?

BERG&amp;rsquo;s theory OLDENBERG seems to set aside completely the conspicuous bucolic pature of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality and to put an Over-emphasis only on one of its features A god of paths cannot be regarded to be intrinsically connected with the prosperity of cattle 56 It may further be asked Had Pusan been originally a lord of paths is it not natural to expect that his seat should have been on the earth rather than in the heaven? The Pusan-religion on the whole gives the impression that it was a special religious cult belonging to a particular Vedic tribe The attempts at associating that religion artificially with the Indra religion and the Soma. ritual, which are evident in the Veda, also seem to support this Impression Can one believe that a god of paths was made ibe central figure in an ipdependent religious cult? The name, Pusan, also cannot be regarded as being particularly appropriate for a lord of paths It may be specifically emphasised that it is not correct to determine the pature of a god only from one or another characteristic feature of his It will, however, be clear from the above discussion that it is exactly what OLDENBERG has done As a matter of fact, it is not necessary to make Pusan an indepen. dent god of paths This feature represents only a part of the essential function of Pusan and may not, therefore, be distin gutshed from it&#xA;The common factor in the majority of the theories regarding Pusan&amp;rsquo;s original nature referred to above may as well be taken to be a reasonable starting point for a correct approach to this problem in the various attempts suitably to modify then original theories scholars seem to agree in making a pointed reference to the obvious bucolic traits wbich characterise that god The sustained impression, which the Vedic passages refer ring to Pusap in general and the Pusan samhitā in the stall mandala in particular produce, is that Pusan must have beca primarily and essentially a pastoral god He supervises the cattit and is responsible for the preservation and increase of herds&#xA;55 OLDENBERGS interpretation of the word, batasudhan shown to be unsatisfactory&#xA;will bc 126&#xA;ÞŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;107&#xA;and flocks (VI 54 5-7) He is often referred to as a cattle giying god (cf VI 53 10 ) It is, indeed notcworthy that Pusan is concerned only with the prosperity of sheep and cattle The pastoral communities are represented in the Veda to bave been nomadic Naturally, they often emphasised one aspect of their special god, Pusan, namely, his lordship over the paths He leads his followers safely from one pasture to another He is celebrated as the knower of treasures (VIII 29 6), indicating thereby that he knows the right place where his pastoral followers should be taken In other words, he secures for them rich pasture lands But, at the same time, he is conscious of his other responsibility to his worshippers on the way he guards them În another passage (VI 56 5), Pusan is invoked to direct this cattle desiring band of ours&amp;rsquo; to the attainment of its desired objects 58 Maoy were the occasions when the cattle went astray and were lost Under such circumstances, the pastoral worshippers often appealed to their god who readily recovered the lost property (VI 54 10 ) Pusan is predominantly characterised as anastapasu (X 17 3), anastavedas (VI 54 8), and paśupa (VI 58 257 Among the pastoral tribes there is a special class of people who distinguish themselves in the art of path finding and tracing the lost sheep and cattle 58 It is this peculiar faculty of an actually existing class among the shepherds and cowherds that is idealised 10 Pusan by his worshippers (VI 54 1) It is a very common feature of any mythology that several characteristics of a god are often derived from the way of living of that god&amp;rsquo;s worshippers&#xA;The god of the warlıke tribes is often represented as a warrior god The anthropomorphic traits of a god in particular may be regarded as being very suggestive in this connection It is easy to imagine that the pastoral tribes made their god look impressive&#xA;56 The logical and natural extension of this invocation is that Püsan should allot to his worshippers their share of mandens (IX. 67 10)&#xA;57 As pointed out earlier Pigan is the only god who receives the cpitbct pafupa directly and not in comparisons&#xA;58 HILLEBRANDT (Op al 328-29) refers to the Whois of Panjab and the Paggi of Gujerat who are known even today for this special faculty which they are said to possess&#xA;108&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;with braided hair (VI 55 2 159 and graceful beard The weapons that he wields are those which are usually employed by his pasto ral worshippers, the only difference being that the goad (VI 539) and the awl (VI 53 5) of Pusan possess some divine power The astrā of Pusan was paśusādhani, that is to say, it helped his worshippers to acquire, preserve, and increase the cattle, and the āra cane in handy when he wanted to punish vitally the pasty mischief mongers, Panis, who harassed the pastoral communities in the course of their forward march to pastures new&amp;rsquo; (VI 53 5) It is also very suggestive, in this context, that Pusan&amp;rsquo;s goad is described as go opasā ( VI 53 9), &amp;ldquo;haying its head or top adorned with the figure of a bull” This word, which, inciden tally, occurs only once in the RV (and whose meaning is accor dingly uncertain ), is also interpreted as &amp;ldquo;provided with a thong made of cattle skin&amp;rdquo; Anyway, it would seem to confirm the essentially pastoral character of Pusan The significance of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s peculiar connection with the goat (I 138 4, VI 55 3,4, 57 3, X 26 8) will be easily realised when we take into consideration the fact that the goat is the most surc footed animal and can traverse the most difficult paths Another very remarka ble example of how the distinctive features of a people are trans ferred to their god is to be found in the Vedic reference where Pusan is said to be weaving the raiment of sheep, and also make ing their raiment clean&amp;rsquo;&#xA;vasovaya &amp;lsquo;yinām ā vasumsi marmriat (X 26 6) This passage can hardly be considered to be apropos unless we assume that Pusan is essentially a god of shepherds Further, it is interesting to note that the god of the shepherds and cowherds eats the simple food which they themselves must be eating, namely, karambha (VI 561) Particularly striking is the fact&#xA;59 The word kapardırt us also understood in the sense of one who Weara string of cowry shells The Vedic references do not, however, sem to support this meaning BANERJEE SHASTRI suggesta (JBORS 18, 1-3) that Laperda was a kind of lcad dress, specially for females He also considers the word opafa (cf co-opaid motioned below), which too, according to him, dc. poted bcad-gear&#xA;PŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;109&#xA;that these pastoral worshippers are not ashamed of their god being a karambhad On the other hand, they put forth a challenge that he&amp;rsquo;who aims at Pusan malignantly saying that he is merely a karambhad can never strike at him successfully&amp;rsquo;&#xA;ja enam ādideśati karambhād iti pūsanam&#xA;na tena dela ādıśe (VI 56 1) Such evil efforts are bound to fail, because the epithet, karambhād, can never hurt the god of the pastoral communities So far as Pūsan&amp;rsquo;s own worshippers are concerned, karambhad is not a scorn ful cpithet 60 This god of the cattle breeding worshippers is praised in a manner quite befitting their general culture No high sounding phrases are used by the poets with reference to Pusan An appeal to him for his friendship (VI 48 18 ) almost creates the actual pastoral atmosphere It is, therefore, safe to conclude that Pusan was already in the Veda a full fledged pastoral divinity As a matter of fact, he represents a divine prototype of a cattle breeding people His pastoral worshippers have invested Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality with a shepherd&amp;rsquo;s appearance, a shepherd&amp;rsquo;s food, and similar other conspicuously bucolic traits Onc may cven go to the extent of asserting that it is impossible to indicate an essen tially bucolic personality in a clearer manner than the Vedic Pusao&#xA;An etymological study of the pame Pusan would also seem am nly to support the basic pastoral character of this god The word pūsan is usually derived from the root, pus, to increase, nourish, bestow bounty 61 This is, however, not satisfactory With that etymology it is not possible to explain why there should be a long pū in pisan 62 An attempt is made by BERGAIGNE63 to&#xA;60 A reference may be made in this connection to the controversy between EDOERTON and Fax (JAOS 40 81-102 ) with regard to the intcrprctation of VI 56!

The Arcadians, indeed, have a goat footed pastoral god On the basis of a Similar possibility in the case of Pusan, DuONT (JA0S 53, 376-3+) connccis that god with another Vedic god, whose name indicates the goat foro namely, Aja Ekapıda Pasan&amp;rsquo;s beard and locks of bair are also considered to be suggestive of the goat form However, so far as the Vedic references are concerned we cannot find any clear traces of the goat form of Pusan IA Vedic mythology Paṣan $ represented as a full fledged anthropomorphic pastoral Juvnity&#xA;PŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;111&#xA;are most conspicuously mentioned in the sixth mandala tends to support the above assumption regarding the Bhāradvājas It is quite certain that the word panı does not have a merely appellative sense The Panis represent a distinct community possessing a religious cult different from the official Vedic religion They always wandered with the Vedic cattle breeding tribes and often used to harass them References to their riches and thefts are quite common in the Veda The Panis were notorious cattle lifters and, therefore, particularly antagonistic to the clan of the Bhāradvājas Thus there was, in the early Vedic times, a con tinuous conflict going on between the Bbāradvājas and the Pants; and the former often invoked their patron god, Pusan, to puoish these mischievous cattie lifters 88 Naturalk, for the Bharad vājas, Püsan was more important than any other god from among the Vedic pantheon The ten gayatrı stanzas of VI 53 seem to have formed some sort of magic formulae belonging to the Pusan cult, which were directed against the Panis, perhaps accompanied by some magic practices It may, therefore, be concluded that the pastoral clan of the Bharadvājas developed the essential persona. lity of Pisan in a distinctive manner 89&#xA;Pūsan&amp;rsquo;s essentially pastoral personality thus represents the first stage in the evolution of the Pūsan mythology It is a common characteristic of the Vedic mythology in general that all gods are at some stage connected with heaven and light&#xA;68 From the references to the conflict between the Panus and the Bhara. dvajas, HILLEBRANDT attempts to determine the geographical locality of the samc His conclusion is that the sixth man ala generally belongs to the Westerly region that is to say, to the moutains of Afghanistan) and not to lada proper In support of this view he brings forth the evidence of Pisan&amp;rsquo;s special connection with Sarasvad, that is to say, with the twer Acarbstonen al , 335-36)&#xA;69 A staustical consideration of the Vedic references to Puṣan is believed to indicate that the Puṣan-cult was later adopted first by the Kanvas and then by the other clans In other words the pastoral elements in other inves also began to celebrate the pastoral god, Puan GUNTERT (De Grische Weltlong, 44 fT ) brings the evidence of certain nord c rock paintings to bear upon the problem of an indogermanic pastoral god He part cularly refers to the paintings found in middle and south Scandinavia la bu book ( 46), he reproduces the sketch of a god, in goat form, with hammers&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;This light symbolism is superimposed upon the original character of the Vedic gods and 15 therefore often casily distinguishable from it It gives an unmistakable impression of artificiality and superficiality This current of thought is clearly perccptible even in the case of an essentially pastoral god like Puṣan It has already been indicated that the light symbolism in Puṣan s pature is distinctly colourless and superficial It is also so vague and ambiguous that it is not easy to determine whether, in this second stage, Puṣan was regarded as a sun god or as a moon god A critical examination of such Vedic passages as are suggestivc of light and splendour, however, Icads onc to bclicic that Pusan was regarded as a moon god rather than a sun god It should first of all, be remembered that Pusan is often cicarly distinguished from the sun (VI 56 3) Then there is a passage ( VI 38 3) where Puṣan 15 described as the messenger of the sur Plying his golden ship in the ocean of the air Is this not clearly indicative of the moon? Further, onc of the aspects of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s original character namely as a path finder can, in the light symbolism, be best transferred to the moon and not to the sun when darkness and difficulties obstruct the way, the moon appears as the real path finder Pusan, in his original character is regarded as a divine shepherd In the mythology of heaven and light, it is common to look upon the moon as the shepherd of the herds of stars This fact will make it clear how very natural the transition from Pusan to the moon god must have been Is it, again not possible to suppose that the horns of the goat the special apimal of Puson gave rise to the imagery of the horns of the crescent moon 770 Further, it is the moon god who is usually regarded as the divine symbol of &amp;lsquo;growth&amp;rsquo;, which is Pusan s special gift&#xA;One of the outstanding features of the Pusan mythology is the peculiar part played by that god in the obscure Suryā myth A critical analysis of that myth brings forth the following facts more or less prominently The basic conception underlying the myth is the representation of a typical heavenly marriage Surya&#xA;70 42-43&#xA;Cf SCHROEDER Aruche Rel goon II 12, GUNTERT, Dir anische Telskar&#xA;PŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;113&#xA;the sun maiden, is the bride and three different gods, namely, Asyins, Soma, and Pūsan, are represented as her wooers While AŚvins are referred to, in one context, as the husbands of Surya (IV 43 6), Soma also is, in another context, said to have been the real bndegroom (X 85 9) This appareat contradiction is explained away by it being suggested that Soma was Surya&amp;rsquo;s first husband and that, in ber second marriage, which was a siayanıvara, she chose Aśvids as her husbands 7We are here concerned only with Pusan&amp;rsquo;s role in thus myth It is said that gods gave Pusao, who was subdued by love, to Surya in marriage (VI 58 4 ) Probably as the husband of Surya, Pusan is connected with the marriage ceremonial, being besought to take the bride&amp;rsquo;s hand and lead her away and to bless her in her conjugal relation (X 85 37)&#xA;Pusan&amp;rsquo;s role as the wooer of Suryā has a two fold signi ficance - mythological and sociological From the point of view of the evolution of the Pusan mythology, we may assume that, in order to stabilize the fight symbolism superimposed upon the original character of Pusan, Vedic poets thought of introduc ing that god ja the Surya myth which must have then become very popular If we further assume that they regarded Pusan, in this second stage in the evolution of his personality, as the moon-god, it 15 casy to imagine how he is mode to play, in the Surya myth, &amp;amp; part similar to that of Soma, who too had come, by that time, to be regarded as the moon god Apart from this mythological sigoificance, Pusan&amp;rsquo;s introduction in the Suryā myth may have had a distinct sociological significance also By the side of the resplen. deot Süryā, the pastoral grucl eater Pusan certainly lends a peculiar touch to the whole myth Is it not likely that, on the strength of the precedent of this heavenly match between Surya and Pusan&amp;ndash;the two divinitics belonging originally to two distinct&#xA;71 A myth almilar to the is found in latush mythology according to which the lovers of the sun maiden are God , sons&amp;rsquo;, whic, in many cases, the moon-god abo appcan us their triumphant rival&#xA;72 CT ICILLI edish Slutum 14-16 73 Indische Studien 1, 136, 100&#xA;15&#xA;114&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;mythological strata&amp;ndash;, the pastoral worshippers of Pusan desired to assert their own claims to matrimonial relations with tribes which, presumably, had already passed beyond the pastoral stage? The inyocation that Pus28 should allot to his worshippers their share of maidens (IX 67 10) would seem to support such conjecture Pusan&amp;rsquo;s part in the Surya myth may then be regarded as the result of the impact of two Vedic communities having different social cultures It must be observed, in this connection, that myth building is not always based on clear cut issues But there cannot be much doubt that the Surya myth must have developed on the sociological background referred to above&#xA;It is further not improbable that the adjustments which the Vedic poets found it necessary to make after having once intro duced Pusan in the myth of Surya, Aśvips, and Soma, reflect the manners and social customs of the pastoral worshippers of Pusan Such adjustments were necessary in view of the fact that Suryā, the bride, was the sun maiden (who was regarded, rather confusedly either as the consort or as the daughter of the sun god), and Pusan, the suitor, was the moon god, who was often regarded as the son of the sun god The epithets of Pusan, namely, mātut didhısu,&#xA;suitor of the mother&amp;rsquo;, and svasur parah, lover of the sister&amp;rsquo; (V 55 4–5), may be interpreted, on the one band, on the basis of the mythological imagery relating to Surya, the sun maiden, and Pusan, the son of the sun god On the other hand, these epithets which are suggestive of the motif of incest may be supposed to rcflcct the practice of Khveruk das marriages, that is to say, marriages among nicar relatives, which were current among some ancient Aryan tribes Such marriages must have formed a peculiat feature of the pastoral communities 74&#xA;The light aspect of Pusan s personality is, however, very super ficial and gives the impression of having been introduced by way of an afterthought It is also considerably hazy But, as point&#xA;74 On this subject see Irawati LARVE The kinshup usages and is family organisat op in Rgveda and Atb arvaveda , ABORI 20 213-31 About the practice of Khaelik das see N Gulose Thic Arın Trail in Iran and Ind a 110 49, 170, also West in SBE, Vol 18, 389 130&#xA;PŪŞAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;115&#xA;out so far, in this stage, Pūsan seems to have been regarded by the Vedic poets as the moon-god. In this context, a reference may be made to a peculiar phenomenon of ancient mythology. The trapsition from the moon-symbolism to the sun-symbolism has always been its characteristic fcaturc. Many imageries connected with the sun-mythology, such as the sun-boat, sun-shovel, sud-egg, etc, can be traced back clearly to the special features of the moon.76 The two cults were consequently brought quite close 10 each other and the transition from the one to the other was almost imperceptible. When, therefore, the light-symbolism was not particularly distinct and clear-cut, it was quite possible to mistake one god for another. Such was actually the case as regards the evolution of the Puṣan mythology. In the Veda itself there is no clear indication that Pūsan was regarded as a sun-god. But if, in later times, Pusan had come to be looked upon as a solar divinity, it must have been due to the usually imperceptible transition from the moon-symbolism to the sun-symbolism.&#xA;As the result of another outstanding characteristic of the Vedic mythology, some more features came to be added to the original Pūsan-religion. It has already been observed that, in the Veda, Pusan is coupled rather conspicuously with Indra (VI, 57 ) and Soma (II 40) This fact has a special significance. The original Pusan-religion of the nomadic pastoral communities fike that of the Bhāradvājas was essentially different from the religion of the Indra-worshippers, which may be regarded as having been more or less the official&amp;rsquo; religion of the Vedic people. Indeed, there are indications in the Veda that the pastoral god, Pūṣan, evoked mockery at the hands of certain other people &amp;ndash; perhaps priests and warriors — who worshipped gods of a different order (I. 42. 10; 138, 4; VI.56.1).76 In order that the gods of different Vedic tribes should combine in one great paatheon, the usual&#xA;75. SAIROEDER has dealt with this question at length in various contexts in drische Religion 11.&#xA;76. It is suggested that the pastoral tribes, whose patron gol was Poran, camc to India with their herds a linie later than the carly warlike tribes who fought their way to the Indian plains,116&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;method adopted by the Vedic poets was to bring all such gods in contact with Indra who represented, so to say, the official religion of the RV sanihula Pusan s association with Indra which is, on the very face of it, superficial and artificial, serves the same purpose Originally there was a marked difference between Indra and Pusad so far as their food (VI 57 2) and vehicles (VI 57 3) were concerned But then Pusan came to be regarded as Indra&amp;rsquo;s comrade and help-mate (VI 56 2,57 4) Not only that but Pusan and Indra came to be ultimately looked upon as brothers (VI 55 5) It will be thus seen that a position of honour in the Vedic paptheon was bestowed in this manner upon Pusan, the original pastoral god All this, however, is obviously late and artificial A similar purpose is served by Pusan&amp;rsquo;s associa tion with Soma (II 40) Hereby Pusan s place in the Vedic ritual was made secure Pusan did not originally have any share in the Soma offering (VI 572) Later, the Pusan cult was loosely connected with Soma it seems likely that Pusan was then offered only half a sacrifice (VI 50 5) and that, ultimately, he claimed his full legitimate share in the Soma offering (X 26 5) A reference may be made here to the peculiar complex on the part of the worshippers of Pusan, who, while claiming a Soma offering for their god, also made Indra participate in Pusan&amp;rsquo;s natural food karambha (III 52 7) This is obviously intended to assert the dignity of the original Pusan religion Ritual offerings are also said to have been made to both Soma and Pusan The Pusan cult is thus clearly one of the many appendages which have shot up in the Soma ritual Naturally, Pusan was also given several attributes in common with other gods in the Vedic pantheon He is called asura (V 51 11 ) and a ruler of heroes (1 1064) He becomes an unconquerable protector and defender (I 89 5) He is said to transcend mortals and is equal to the gods in glory (VI 48 19 )&#xA;There are thus primarily three kinds of impact that are reflected in the Pusan mythology The original pastoral religion of Pusan suggests that there was a tribal impact of an antagonistic character between the Bhātadvajas and the Panis An impact more or less of a social character is indicated by the Sūrya myth&#xA;PÜSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD&#xA;117&#xA;And finally, there was a religious impact which resulted in a place of honour being conceded to Pusan in the Vedic religion and ritual It is also not unlikely that some such adjustment gave rise to a peculiar feature of the Pusan cult That god was Origibally a pastoral divinity, but later on he seems to have been connected with agriculture also (IV 57 7) 77&#xA;The later development of the Pusan-cult will be found to betray unmistakably certain traits of that god&amp;rsquo;s original character&#xA;The fact that Pūsan is supposed to lead the bride to the bride groom&amp;rsquo;s house (X 85 26, Afvala yana GSI 81, Paraskara GS I 416) and also to lead the dead to the other world (X. 173) is the result of that god&amp;rsquo;s natural lordship over the paths and of his nature as a path finder 78 The memory of Pūsan&amp;rsquo;s special faculty to find lost things has survived in the myth that Pusan found the lost Soma (I 23 13-14) and Agni (X55) In&#xA;Alvalayana GS III 79, a sacrifice to Pūsan is recommended for getting the lost things restored In the afvamedha sacrifice, a goat is offered as Pusan&amp;rsquo;s portion, in order to announce the sacrifice to the gods (I 162 2-4, TS V 612) This fact indicates, beyond doubt, the original pastoral character of Puṣan The description in the Salapatha Brāhmaṇa (I 747) that Pusan is a toothless god is certainly based on that pastoral gads natural fondness for karambla That Brāhmana (as also TS II 6 8 2-7) has tried to rationalize, by means of a myth, that peculiar feature of Püsan, the proper significance of which was perhaps not realiscd then The same myth is developed in the later epic literature where we are told that, on a certain occa $100, god Rudra destroyed the tceth of Pusan &amp;quot; [ Fint publwhed NIA 5, 1912, 49-66 )&#xA;77 fo Afinaragrafas 7tra II 10 7, Pupan u included among the divinities who are celebrated at the eyjand&amp;ndash;the ceremony of collecting together imple mcat for agriculture Puṣap part in the tyfolsarga xule may be supposed to indicate that he was also regarded as a god of fertility&#xA;78 About Posan connection with the marriage ceremony, also scc supre&#xA;79 Cf Bhigarala Puey 5 21-22, 74 A reference may be made in Dawing to the fact that in the 16tdiyopanised (at 15-16).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RUDRA IN THE VEDA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out by me in another paperi that one of the very intriguing problems of Indian mythology pertains to the elevation of the god Viṣṇu from a more or less minor and obscure position which he occupies in Vedic mythology to the position of supreme preeminence in the later Hindu pantheon I have presented in that paper a complete picture of the various VICISSI tudes which occurred in the personality and character of that god from the point of view of what I have called evolutionary mythology, and have thereby offered a solution of that problem&#xA;A similar problem can be posed in respect of another Vedic god, namely, Rudra It must be added, in this connection, that, as a matter of fact, the importance of the problem relating to Rudra is not limited only to the study of Indian religion and mythology For, in more senses than one, the Rudra problem touches several significant aspects of the entire cultural history of ancient India As a consequence of this, the Rudra problem naturally tends to become far more complex and comprehensive than the Visau problem&#xA;A study of the Vedic literature as a whole brings out a very striking fact about the god Rudra It will appear, from that study, that there are, as it were, two distinct Rudras represented in that literature - one in the Rgieda (RV) and the other in the post-RV Vedic literature? The Rudra of the RV, for instance, is a heavenly god, while in the post-RV literature he is regarded as being essentially earthly In the RV, Rudra&amp;rsquo;s hosts are generally represented to be the Maruts, while in the post-RV literature Rudra is accompanied by various kinds of evil spirits and dreadful beings As a matter of fact, the post-RV Rudra seems to have&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW LIGHT ON THE VEDIC GOD, SAVITR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There has been considerable difference of opinion, among Vedic scholars, in respect of the exact interpretation of the character and personality of the Vedic god, Savitr. This fact naturally enbances our interest in the study of the Vedic mythology concerning that god A critical approach to the problem regarding the essential nature of Savitr is expected greatly to clanfy our views in the matter of Indo-European (IE ) mytho logy in general and Vedic mythology in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

MEYER), Varuṇa as the moon god (OLDENDERG, HILLCR ANDT), and Varun as the occan god (PISCHEL), and had shown them to be quite unacceptabic Today I shall examinc some other theories about Varuny, which have been advanced in recent times, and then set forth my own Vicws on the subject&#xA;One of the most outstanding works on Varuṇa, published in recent times, is that of Heinrich LUDERS&amp;rsquo; Luckily for us, it was possible to salvage this magnuni opus, to a fairly large extent,&#xA;2 DANDEKAR Asura Varuṇa, publ sled elsewhere in this Volume.&#xA;3 11 LULDERS Iasuna laruto un do I assur, Cutlingen, 1951, II, Varuga bord das Ria, Cotungen 192314&#xA;vedic MYTILOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;from the ncar devastation which its manuscript had suffered at the hands of mindless marauders after the sccond world war LUDERS begins by setting forth some of the main features of his methodology He does not accept the principle enunciated by several carlier Vedists, likc OLDENBERG and HILLCBRANDT, Damely, that the Veda ought to be interpreted primarily with the help of the Vedi itself He does not approve of &amp;lsquo;isolating&amp;rsquo; the Veda by ignoring in this manner the traditional scholastic interpretation and the subsequent literature He believes that pre classical and classical Sanskrit texts have grown in the same spiritual climate as the Veda and may, indeed, be regarded as representing a dependable continuity of Indian tradı tion Further, it is always expedient to try to intcrpret the &amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rsquo; by relating it to something which is definitely known According to LUDERS, one must needs approach the text of the Veda without any preconceived notions concerning the Vedic religion and mythology In this context, he strongly objects to the assumption of a physical phenomenon as the basis of each and every Vedic god, which assumption has given rise to a perplexing multiplicity in the Veda of sun gods and moon gods and rain gods * He also insists that the etymological analysis of the name of a Vedic god is by no means a sure starting point in the matter of investigating the true nature of that god Further more, LUDERS says that it is wrong to suppose that the Vedic Rsis always meant something other than what they actually said, that, in other words, they used language only to conceal their thoughts He criticises the eclectic method of many earlier Vedists and takes to tash such of them as were wont to brand Vedic thought as primitive&#xA;All this is, no doubt, more or less unexceptionable But the conclusions which LUDERS has arrived at after an apparently thorough going study of all the Vedic passages referring to Varuṇa are, unfortunately, not so LUDERS line of argument, as I understand it, is something like this&#xA;4 HILLEBRANDT, on the other hand, criticises the &amp;ldquo;Begriffsmythologen&amp;rdquo; VALI, 6 ff)&#xA;veDIC GOD VARUNA&#xA;315&#xA;In the Vedic as well as the post Vedic and the classical Sanskrit literature, Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s dwelling place is said to be waters At the same timc, in the RV, Varuṇa is also associated with the heaven According to LUDERS, these two beliefs are by no means mutually contradictory For, the Vedic cosmology regards the heaven as the proper home of waters Indeed, the heavenly and the earthly waters are identical and Varuṇa is connected with both 5&#xA;Varuṇa is also most closely connected with rta LUDERS devotes the major part of the second volume of his great work to the lexical and conceptual consideration of rta He asserts that rta is the exact equivalent of satya and means nothing more than Wahrheit or truth In classical Sanskrt, the word satza, in such compounds as satyanrte, is clearly used to denote the opposite of anrta, that is to say, to denote ria LUDERS traces back this very sense, namely rta=satya=truth through the Brāhmaṇas, to the RV He claims that, in all the Rgvedic passages where the word rta occurs, the meaning truth&amp;rsquo; fits in very well Of course, this basic meaning does show various secondary ramifications, but, LUDERS insists, the word rta in the RV ncver denotes any. thing like cosmic order&#xA;Varuṇa resides among waters and 15 the guardian of truth There is another concept which is closely associated with truth and waters simultaneously, and that is the concept of oath An oath is a solemn affirmation, made usually with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed, and, according to the ancient Indian tradition water had to be invariably used while taking oaths LUDERS, therefore, concludes that Varuṇa, who is asso ciated with truth and waters, is the god of oath, which too is&#xA;5 Incidentally. Luepers alds that Varuṇa is nowhere ident ficd with water, nor is he anywhere represented as a water god According to him, there is no masculine water god in the Veda&#xA;G LUEDERS had propounded thus theory as early as in 1910 (SBAI. Berlin, 1910, 931) Scef n 50 in &amp;quot; Asura Varuṇa Incidentally, god of oath may be understood as the presiding god of the concept and action of oath or as the god by whom one swean&#xA;316&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;associated with truth and waters He points out that it is in Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s nature as the god of oath that we have to seek the origin of his kingship The oath god Varuṇa, as the guardian of rta or truth, discerns truth and falsehood, he acts as a judge and punishes the violator of truth - he thereby comes to be regarded as the sovereign lord LUDERS accepts MEILLET&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that Mitra is essentially a god of contract and says that it confirms Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s character as the god of oath, for, like Mitra and Varuṇa,&#xA;contract and oath are closely connected with each other&#xA;I find LUDERS&amp;rsquo; reasoning quite unconvincing It is, indeed, difficult to accept that rta and salja are exactly synonymous In many Vedic passages, the words rta and satya are used side by side and this, not just by way of stylistic variation Comment ing on AV IX 5 21, sarjam ca rtam ca caksusi, LUDERS says that satja and rta are the two eyes, which latter are two exactly identical entities, therefore, satya and rta too must be regarded as being identical It may, however, be pointed out that the two eyes are not identical but that they are complementary Ria and satya also are not identical, but they are complementary This is confirmed by TS V 1 58 rtam salyam ity aha, ayam (that is Prthvi) 1ā riam, asau (that is Dyaus ) saryam In AV XII 5 10, rta and satja are celebrated with various mutually complementary pairs such as payas and rasa, anna and annadya, ista and pūrta, prajā and paśu In this context, W Norman BROWN suggests Rgvedic man saw the universe in two parts. One in which the gods and men live-sar, below the earth there is the place of horror inhabited only by demons - asar, to make the sat operate perfectly, every creature had its duty, his personal function (vrata), and when he lived by it he was an observer of ria One may not agree with all that BROWN says, but there is certainly a point in his suggestions that sat is, in a sense, the result of rta and that vraia and rta are closely related to each other&#xA;7 According to LUEDERS, the concepts of the oath god and the contract god have originated among the Aryans They do not go back to the Indo European period, nor can they be shown to have been borrowed from any forcago BOURCES&#xA;8 JAOS 62, 85 ff&#xA;VEDIC GOD VARUNA&#xA;317&#xA;Again, it is not only in classical Sanskrit that we come across the compound sat, anrte, wherein the word satja is claimed to have replaced the word rta which had become more or less extinct in the mean time The compound occurs even in the RV (cf VII 49 3 sarjanrte aapasjan janänām), when the word rta was still quite alive And if ra and satja Wcre synonyms, why should only the word rta have almost disappeared in later litera ture? The reason obviously was that the two words denoted two different concepts, and that, in the course of the evolution of ancient Indian religio philosophical thought, only the concept of ria had been superseded by other newly arisen and equally signifi cant concepts like brahman and dharma Further, it is strange that LUDERS should have sought to determine the meaning of rta from that of anria, or to interpret the Vedic usage with the help of the classical Sanskrit usage And is druh not often used - both in the Veda and the Aresta -to denote the opposite of na? And druh certainly does not mcan only untruth&amp;rsquo;-t has a far wider connotation The Avestan aśa which is believed to be the exact equivalent of the Vedic sta— both linguistically and concep tually represents, according to NYBERG, the riche course of nature or the well regulated life The Vedic rta too has an unmistakable cosmic nuuoce which cannot be adequately expressed by translating that word with mere truth&amp;rsquo;&#xA;To connect Varuṇa with oath because he is said to have waters as his abode and water is used wlule swearing is patently farfetched These two ideas belong to two altogether different thought worlds LUDERS&amp;rsquo; reference to oath water having been regarded, in the Indo European period, as a representative of the water of the world of the deid would, indeed, seem to vitiate his own argument One my also ask whether the characterisation of Varuṇa as the god of oath was not too much restricted It can certainly not be said to cover all the essential traits of that god&amp;rsquo;s personality It is also not understandable why the god of oath should have been clevated to such a pre cminent position in the&#xA;II S MYTERO Du Re giorm der alten Iran, Leipzig, 1938&#xA;318&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;Rgvedic religion and mythology Why should oath have played such a prominent role in the Vedic thought complex? There are hardly any significant passages in the RV where oath&amp;rsquo; as such has been even mentioned The concept of oath can by no means be considered to be of such vital importance that the god, who is believed to preside over it, should come to be regarded as the majestic Asura&#xA;THIEME in his book Mitra and Aryaman,10 unquestioningly accepts MEILLET&amp;rsquo;s formula, namely, that the Indo Iranian god Mitra is nothing but contract deified He then goes on to say that, if Mitra is the personification of an ethical abstract, so must also be Varuṇa who is closely associated with him. He thus discoun tenances (and I fully agree with him in this respect the theories of BERGAIGNE, OLDENBERG, HILLEBRANDT, and others, who have sought to explain the two gods as the personifications of natural phenomena THIEME also whole heartedly supports LUDERS&amp;rsquo; suggestion that rta means &amp;rsquo;truth &amp;ndash; and nothing but truth. He is indeed, so very enthusiastic about this that he hails LUDERS for having, once for all, banished from Vedic philology the equation rla cosmic order But THIEME is not inclined to accept LUDERS&amp;rsquo; subsequent suggestion that Varuṇa is the god of orth LUDERS derives the word saruna from the root yrito enclose, and then asserts that varuna meaning that which closes in&amp;rsquo; is a designation of the concept of oath&amp;rsquo; and that Varuṇa is Oath personified&#xA;THIEME would rather agree with MEILLET that the word varuna — and possibly also yrafa (which, according to THIEME means &amp;rsquo; vow&amp;rsquo;)- may be derived from the IE root ver &amp;rsquo;to speak&amp;rsquo;. However, while going along with MEILLET on two points, namely, that Mitra personifies contract and that the word aruna may be derived from IE ver to speak&amp;rsquo;, THIEME doubts 111s conjecture that the appellative meaning of aruna can be law&amp;rsquo; * order&amp;rsquo; THIEME believes that a law&amp;rsquo; is enforced by an orga&#xA;10 Transactions of the Copaccticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vol 41, New Ilaven, 1957,&#xA;VEDIC GOD VARUNA&#xA;319&#xA;aised political porer, its moral justification being secondary or even altogether lacking and that an undeveloped society, like the Vedic society, cannot rely so much on laws&amp;rsquo; in a technical sense as on the recognition of ethical standards that are protec ted by gods&#xA;In fine, THIEME combines parts of two distinct theories — namely, LUDERS equation rta = truth and MEILLET&amp;rsquo;s deri Talion of saruna from the JE ver &amp;rsquo;to speak&amp;rsquo; -and proposes that Varuṇa means &amp;ldquo;true speech His entire formula relatiog to the religious ideology centering round the three principal Adityas (which formula he claims to be of a systematic character is Varuṇa “True Speech&amp;rsquo;, Mitra “Contract&amp;rsquo;, Aryaman Hospita lity&amp;rsquo; THIEME says that the common moral functions of God Contract and God True Speech arc, of nccessity, governed by one great principle they discover and punish untruth and protect truth in this statement, THIEME has at least used the words God Contract and God True Speech, actually, however, he seems to think that even the names Mitra and Varuṇa occurring in the RV can be adequately translated respectively with (mere) Con tract and (mere) True Speech For instance&#xA;III 59 14 milto janan jalajanı brunanah &amp;lsquo;Contract, when named, males peoples array themselves&#xA;III $9 10 mtro dadhara prthinum uta djam &amp;lsquo;Contract has earth and heaven in keeping&#xA;VII 86 20 kada antar sarune bhuvanı When shall I get inside of True Speech ? :&#xA;VII 82 5c Asemena mutro Tarunam durasjatı Through peara, Cantmet welzards Tree Sprechi&#xA;I believe that these specimens of THIEME S translation! would suffice to establish the invalidity of his theories regarding Mitra and Varuṇa&#xA;It may also be pointed out that MEILLET S derivation of the word mitra from me to exchange&amp;rsquo; is by no means beyond&#xA;Canonc imagine ruch extreme abstract on in Rgvedic hymns&#xA;320&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;doubt&amp;rdquo;: And the sociological sense of contract shich is superim posed on that word is neither vouchsafed by the Vedic texts nor is It compatible with the religio-philosophical ideology of the Vedic people Further, as has been recently pointed out by W LENTZ, the Iraniin evidence too does not support MEILLET&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that Mithra represents deificd contract According to that scholar, he rather symbolises man s striving to live a balanced, well regulated and co operative life Similarly, the derivation of varuna from IE ver to speak creates obvious linguistic difficul. ties&amp;rdquo;! For instance, the IE root ver to speak&amp;rsquo; does not gene ratc any derivatives in u themes As for the word vrata, it cannot mean just verbal &amp;lsquo;Vow Vratas are not merely affairs of speech&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VISNU IN THE VEDA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most intriguing problems of Indian mythology relates to the elevation of Viṣṇu in the classical Hindu mythology to the prominent position of the supreme god from the more or less minor position which has been assigned to him in the Vedic mythology. He cannot be said to have ever been regarded, in the Vedic religion, as a god of any consequence. We do come across a few Vedic references to Viṣṇu (II 1 3,22 1, 34 11 ) which seem to reflect his glory, but actually they are quite general and pointless in character and by no means indicate that Viṣṇu ever dominated Vedic thought and faith, as for instance, Varuṇa and Indra did. Hymns in praise of Viṣṇu are, indeed, very few, he is celebrated in not more than five whole hymns and in parts of others, while his name occurs only about a hundred times in the Rgveda (RV). Even in those stray passages, Viṣnu is very casually mentioned among a crowd of other divinities He thus seems to have occupied a comparatively subordinate position in the pantheon of Vedic gods, from which he rose, more or less suddenly, to supreme eminence in Hindu mythology of all the Vedic gods, Viṣṇu is perhaps the only god whose name is prominently preserved in the Hindu Trinity&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VRTRAHA INDRA&#xA;Vedic mythology, as we generally know it from the Rgreda (RV), is clearly dominated by the personality of Indra By far the largest number of suhtas - about 250 out of 1028 — are ex clusively devoted to the glorification of this god Apart from these suktas, there are several others, wherein Indra is praised in association with other gods or is referred to in some other connec tion Indra is thus obviously the most popular god of the Vedic pantheon He has always been regarded almost as the very sym bol of the official Vedic religion&amp;ndash;the Indra mythology being very nearly identified with the Vedic rcligion as a whole It is true that Indra is celebrated in nearly one fourth of the RV, but this fact must not be taken to indicate, as is usually done, that the Vedic religion had all along been dominated by the Indra my thology Such an assumption could only be the result of study ing the Vedic mythology as if it were a static phenomenon and would make it difficult rationally to correlate several mytho logical concepts in the Veda with the facts derived from the study of comparative philology, comparative mythology, anthropo logy, and the cultural history of the Aryans A critical study of the Veda would show that the Vedic mythology is essentially an cvolutionary mythology, that, at different stages in the cvolution of the Vedic mythological thought it has been domi nated by different Vedic gods, and that the Indra-dominated mythology represents but a lic stage in the course of that cyolu tion There is another aspec the Vedic mythology It will be seen that the personality of a Vedic god normally presents a cry complex picture it often contains ciements which are mutually inconsistent or sometimes cien self-contradictory Tlus peculiar inythological plicnomc. non can be satisfactoriis explained only on the assumption that a cdic god possesses a growing&amp;rsquo; personality with the dific reat vicissitudes in Vedic life and culture, different elements came&#xA;142&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;to be introduced into the personality of a Vedic god In other words, the dynamic character of the life of the Vedic people is faithfully reflected in the complex make up of their gods To emphasize only certain specific clements in a god&amp;rsquo;s personality and thus try to define his character, one way or another, would, therefore, be unsound What we have to do is to determine, 10 the light of the facts derived from the study of comparative philo logy, comparative mythology, anthropology, and the cultural history of the Aryans, the prionty of these varied elements, and thereby present, so to say, a complete history of the entire be coming&amp;rsquo; of a Vedic god A study of the Vedic god, Indra, from the point of view of this two fold evolutionary character of the Vedic mythology, would lumine several obscure points concern ing the Vedic mythology in general and the personality of Indra in particular&#xA;If we were to analyse the large number of the RV-passages referring to Indra and his activities, we would find that they present three main strands of the personality and character of that god Indra is presented as a cosmic power, as a warlıke leader of the Vedic Aryans, and as an ancient mythical dragon killing hero Most of the descriptions of Indra are centred round his war with and subsequent victory over Vr̥tra This is by far the most outstanding event in Indra&amp;rsquo;s career A proper under standing of this event would, therefore, serve as an adequate starting point for a critical study of Indra&amp;rsquo;s personality and character We may begin with an ancient traditional attempt at interpreting this contest between Indra and Vr̥tra Yaska, the author of the Niruksa, has posed the question ko yrtrah who was Vytra? He has mentioned two principal views regarding this question it appears that, more or less by way of a purva paksa, he refers to the opinion of the Aitihasikas who believed that Vr̥tra was a demon, a son of Tvastī Without, however, caring to discuss and refute this view, Yaska states the view of the school of the Nairuktas, who held that Vịtra represented a&#xA;1&#xA;Porukia 11 16&#xA;VRTRAHA INDRA&#xA;143&#xA;cloud This passage from the Nirukta would thus clearly show that, even since very early times, there have been two principal schools of interpretation of the Vedic mythology &amp;ndash; the historical school and the naturalistic school The etymologists, among whom Yaska was the foremost adhered to the naturalistic inter pretation The influence of the naturalistic school on Vedic studies in general has, indeed, been very great, and many scholars belonging to the earlier generation of modern Vedists accepted, without demur and almost as the final solution of the problem, the theory that the Vedic gods represented various powers of nature and that the Vedic mythology consisted of symbolical descriptions of various phenomena of nature Incidentally, it may be pointed out that, among themselves, the naturalistic mytho logists are not unanimous as to which specific power of nature a particular Vedic god represents in pursuance of the naturalistic idcology, the Vedic gods are classified into three categories those belonging to the sky, those belonging to the mid region and those belonging to the earth, in accordance with the cosmic regions where the powers of nature represented by those gods normally become evident&#xA;The most dominant view so far as the naturalistic inter pretation of the Indra mythology is concerned, is the one suggest ed by Yaska His lead has been followed by a majority of the carly Vedists of the modern times Indra is said to be the personification of thunderstorm He stands at the head of the gods of the antariksa and is verily the rain god of the Vedic pan. theon The heavenly waters are obstructed by the cloud demon, Vpira Indra, therefore, smites down this cloud demon by means of his vajra or thunderbolt, and releases the waters, which then flow down in the form of rain showers The various descriptions, in the RV, of the Indra-Vr̥tra battle are said to be cleariy jadi cative of the phenomena of thunderstorm, lightning, and rain Heaven and carth tremble with fear when Indra strikes Vr̥tra with&#xA;2 As a matter of fact uska mention the vicw of tic Anti a Las alter Te has mentioned his own In his commentary on c RI Siyana cons stently follows the airulta view ( , for instance, bis comm on II 12.3, 111 336&#xA;144&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;his bolt (I 80 11,11 11 9, 10, VI 17 9) Trees bow down before Indra and so does si adhui as if in fear (I 55 4, V 32 10) As a matter of fact, cvervthing trembles when this terrific war between Indra and Vr̥tra takes place (VI 31 2) The thundering god (X 92 8 ) raises the dust on high (VI 18 2) The demon, who obstructs the free flow of waters is variously referred to as Vstra, Ahi, Sambara, etc: He lay hidden among the waters (II 11 5), and Indra is said to have killed him while he was lying across the waters (I[ 11 9) Sometimes Indra is said to have torn asunder the mountains and released the waters or cows imprisoned in its caves (1 32 11, 57 6, III 36 6, IV 17 1, X 89 7) This theme is repeated in one form or another in most of the hymns which celebrate Indra&amp;rsquo;s glory (132, 80, II 12, 14) A Vedic poet, while proclaiming the heroic deeds of Indra, begios by pointing out that the first of such deeds was that the wielder of the vajra slew the dragon lying on the mountain, released the waters, and pierced the belly of the mountains (1 32 1,2) In support of their theory that Indra is the Vedic rain god, scho lars have emphasized the fact of his close association with the Maruts Thc Maruts according to them, are clearly the storm dividities who help Indra in bis great exploit (III 35 9, 47 3-4, VI 17 11, X 113 3) Indra&amp;rsquo;s connection with the Maruts is so close that the epithet, marufian, is more or less exclusively applied to Indra&amp;quot; It is in their company - and often with their&#xA;3 According to MCIR (OST V, 95), the demons of drought the hostile powers in the atmosphere who malevolently shut up the watery treasure i clouds - are called by a variety of names such as tra Ahi, Susna DARSLE STETER (Omard et Ahr man p 97) calls ftra &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo;cnveloppant while LUDWIG (Der Rg eda TII, 337) says that tra keeps away the heavenly waters from the world PERRY (JAOS 11, pp 117 205 ) 15 of the opinion that the different names for ftra are but d fferent naipes for one and the same thing namely the cloud According to Macour (The Early Rel gton, 106 ), the Ahi represents originally coth.og more than the crest of the approaching thunderstorm looked upon as a gigantic make&#xA;4 HILLEER AWDT (VILI 312 fr ) however believes that Indra s spliere of activity is diamctrically opposed to that of the Maruts He further points out that some \cd c families do not invoke Indra and the Maruts together (It may be specially noted that for this paper the first cdition (consisting of thre parts Breslau, 1891-1902) of HILLEBRANDT Ved sche Agthologie (Var) bas been used ]&#xA;VRTRAHA INDRA&#xA;145&#xA;jelp - that Indra accomplishes all his celestial exploits, parti. &amp;lsquo;ularly his cocrcion of the evil spirits of air, who arrested rain, ad the subsequent deliverance of the heavenly streams (I 6 5, 04, 100, 101, 165, III 47 3, 4, VIII 65 2, 3, 4, X 55) ledists like ROTH (PW), OLDENBERG (Rel d Veda, 29 51, 34 ff ), MACDONELL (VM, 54 ff ), PERRY (JAOS 11, 17-205), and BLOOMFIELD (JAOS 15, 143 ), have asserted hat the picture of the thunderstorm is throughout quite clear in Il these and numerous other descriptions of this kind (1 32 13, 26, 80 12, II 30 3, V 32 4) They, therefore, hold that ndra was essentially a rain-god in the Veda • In this connection, tis assumed that philologically the roots in the words, indra and&#xA;G&#xA;1847, 72 gbe root, dhe&#xA;alleries of Rom&#xA;5 OLDENDERG believes that Indra is a storm-god, who bears certain re Tadian features&#xA;6 Rotit ( Zellers Thrologusches Jahrbuch 1846 352 ) was originally of the pinion that Indra was the god of the bright clear vault of the heaven He erived the name Indra from the root, dh dh and took it to mean the radiant one&amp;rsquo; (ZDVIG 1847, 72 A) LABBEN ( Ind Alter I, 893) adopted hus Tice of Rott though the etymology of the word suggested by him was&#xA;Tercat from Rom. As a matter of fact Indras close connection with the ky was assumed by several other schoları like BENFEY (00 48 fr ), MAX JULLER (Ledures on Semce of Language II, 470), GRASINANY (RV) and&#xA;YRIANTIEUS (Die Afons Xvi) Bexrey regarded Indra as the god of the ain-sky wbile Max MULLER held that the real representative of Jupiter, &amp;lsquo;in he Veda, was not Dyaus but Indra According to that scholar and MUR&#xA;OST V, 77), Indra was to be identified with Jup ter Pluvius Later on, however, VLAX MULLER Calls Indra the chief solar deity of India (Ch ps II,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YAMA IN THE VEDA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain features of the Yama-mythology as represented in the Rgveda (RV) are apparently quite simple and uncomplicated This seeming simplicity itself has, however, misled many a scholar in the matter of the true interpretation of this mythology The picture of Yama - his personality and functions - as reconstructed from the RV references is characterised by considerable inconsis tency, discrepancy and vagueness An approach to this whole problem from the standpoint of evolutionary&amp;rsquo; mythology will alone make it possible to restate the whole Yama-mythology as a reasonably homogeneous and consistent whole&#xA;Let us first of all briefly recapitulate the several details of this mythology as given in the RV Only four complete hymns in the RV refer to Yama His name occurs about fifty times in the RV passages, which are almost exclusively to be found in the first and the tenth books of the RV Yama thus belongs, like Parjanya, to the fifth class or group of Vedic gods, on the basis of the frequency of the mention of his name This minor position held by Yama in the Vedic mythology indicates that the true nature of the personality of that god was already being tost sight of, the Vestiges of his original importance being revealed, as will be shown hereafter, only through stray references To begin with, a very significant fact about Yama is that he is never explicitly called a&#xA;god&amp;rsquo; in the RV He is no doubt mentioned in the company of other gods &amp;ndash; with Agni and Matarisyan among others (I 164 46), with Varuṇa (X 14 7) with Brhaspati (X 14 3) and with Agni among others (X 64 3,92 11) In X 51 1, we are told that a god found the hiding Agni, in X 51 3, we are told that it was Yama, who found Agoi thus indicating indirectly that Yama was a god At the same time, it is equally significant that Yama is never called a man&amp;rsquo; As a matter of fact, he is clearly distin guished from the putrs (X 15 8), whose king and ford he is, though only once he is himself called pita (X 135 1) - obvi ously in a dufferent sense The mention of Yama and deid&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;119&#xA;Varuṇa, side by side (X 14 7), does not at all indicate that the poet wanted to distinguish between man Yama and god Varuṇa. Other passages of that pature (III 205, IV 51 11 ) will show that such a reference does not possess any special significance Yama, however, is clearly a marty a according to AV XVIII 3 13 This unique aspect of Yama&amp;rsquo;s character certainly provides an important clue for our investigation&#xA;The majority of Vedic references to Yama describe him as the lord of the blessed dead (X 14 3-7, 16 4) He is the first mortal, the first to go the way of death and to point out the path for the departed souls to follow (X 14 2) He is the gatherer of men, their guide and pathfinder (X 14 1) and gives men a resting place (X 14 9, AV XVIII 2 37) Of the three heavens, two belong to Sayıts and one to Yama (1 35 6 Also X 123 6)&#xA;Yama&amp;rsquo;s father is said to have been Vivasvat and his mother Saranyu (X 14 5,17 1,2) In another context (X 10 4), however, the parents of Yama and his twin-sister, Yami, are mentioned to have been the Gandharva and the Water Nymph&#xA;Yama&amp;rsquo;s abode is in the highest heaven (X 14 8), he dwells 10 the remote recess of the sky (IX 113 8 dnah avarodhanam? BLOOMFIELD, The Religion of the Veda, 144, translates this as&#xA;• heaven&amp;rsquo;s firm abode&amp;rsquo;) One has to cross mighty streams to reach there (X 14 1, AV YI 28 3, XVIII 4 7)&amp;rsquo; Reference is made to the harmijas for Yama (AV XVIII 4 55) and to&#xA;Yamasya sadananı&amp;rsquo; (X 135 7, AV II 12 7, XVIII 2 56, 3 70). Under a beautiful tree, Yama revels in the company of gods, there the father entertais kindly thoughts about the forefathers&#xA;i Strangely, LUDWO regards thu as a hell (Der Rigveda IV, 134)&#xA;7 The meaning of the word proval used in these contexts is contro versial. See OLDENBERC, RAV, 545-46 RV IX. 113 8 uses the words yahoatih apah RV X. 63 10 scems to mention a boat in this connection HOPKINS, (PAOS 1891, XCIV-XCV) is inclined to think that Yama s abode was on the carth. It was the ancient bome of the Arvans recollection of which as across the mountains pradata ?) they still retained Also The Religions of Ind a, 134&#xA;3 According to LAT this harnya 1 a mound of the dead (Cf MACDONELL VAT, 173, f. 2) Also, hauska Salra 86 11&#xA;4 PISCELEL suggests 16 Sou 1, 242) that this dcnotes Yama s chapel, Tous suggestion is unacceptable&#xA;120 VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;(X 135 1) Yama is thus primarily regarded as a legendary king, who, by his boliness, was enabled to establish a realm of immortal life and bliss for the righteous of oiden time, to which good men of all generations had the right of entry In most RY passages, he is chiefly celebrated as the king of the blessed dead He assembles the flocks of the departed (X 14 1) in a marvellous kingdom, where there is neither cold nor suffering. He is the king (IX 113 8 ) and the father (X 135 1) He has found a way for many and along that path he leads men into their last abode ( X 14 2) Later, however, we see Yama&amp;rsquo;s character in the process of change to bus post-Vedic role as the horrific judge of the dead He is brought in close connection with Death. Death is said to be the path of Yama (1 38 5) He is the brother of Mityu and is mentioned by the side of Antaka and Mrtyu (VS 39 13) Mrtyu is Yama&amp;rsquo;s messenger ( AV XVIII 2 27) in certain cases Yama is even identified with Mrtyu (X 165 4, MS II 56, AV VI 28 3, 93 1) References to Yama&amp;rsquo;s padbiśu (X 97 16) to his messengers, ulūka and kapora (X, 165 4), and to his dogs (X 14 10-12) further help to consolidate his character as the fearful god of death&#xA;Let us now turn to a uniquc hymn, in which Yama ligures very prominently in a dialogue between Yama and his twin. $1$ter, Yami, (X 10) Yama is shown to be protesting strongly against the advances of Yam for a sexual intercourse which was intended for the procreation of the burdan race The impression derived from that hymn as a whole, however, is that, in spite of the suggestion of the apparently immoral motif of incest, Yama and Yami were then actually regarded as the first parents of the human race? Yama&amp;rsquo;s protest only reflects the moral scruples of&#xA;the author of that hymn&#xA;5 CH OLDENZERC, RAV, 532–33 A rcfoccace may be made here to the sabha of Yama described in Afghabharala II 8&#xA;6 In the TV, Yami 1s both wife and sister of Yama CF HOPKINS, The Religions of India, 131) Also TS ILI 3 8 3 In the Iranjan mythology we have Yıma and Yumch (the latter, however, docs not appear in the Avesta). who correspond with Yama and Yami&#xA;7 L. VON SCHROEDER believes ( Anscht Religion IT, 318 ) that the dia. logue between Yama and Yam represents a fertility drarua&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;121&#xA;Apart from these main references, attention may be drawn to other passages, which, thougb stray and obscure, are of consi derable importance Yama is said to have been the first to stretch the web of the human race or of sacrifice (VII 33 9) A reference is already made to Yama&amp;rsquo;s hayıng discovered the hidden Agni (X 51 1-4) This fact also seems to represent Yama&amp;rsquo;s function as the first sacrificer But Yama was not merely the first sacrificer&amp;rsquo;, he was also the first sacrificed. For the sake of progeny, Yama, we are told (X 13 4), chose death, in spite of his deathless birth (1 83 5) be surrendered his own dear body in the sacrifice (X 13 4) The metres, which symbolise the sacrifice, are said to be deposited in Yama (X 14 16, AV XVIII 2 6 In such cases, Yama seems to be exalted almost to the position of an All god&#xA;Can these heterogeneous and, in many cases vague details of the Yama mythology in the Veda be presented in a systematic and consistent manner, indicating thereby the various successive stages in the evolution of that mythology?&#xA;Before we proceed further, it would be helpful to examine the views of earlier scholars in regard to Yama&amp;rsquo;s personality and func tions The study of the Vedic mythology was, in its early stages, dominated by what may be called the naturalistic&amp;rsquo; tendency As a matter of fact, this was the case with regard to the study of all ancient mythologies It was normal to trace the origin of gods to natural phenomena Ancient mythology in general, and the Vedic mythology in particular, thus gods and moon gods Yama was, for instance, made to represent both the sun god and the moon god EHNI, who has written two independent research monographs on Yama, believes that Yama is primarily the deified representation of the sun, particularly the setting sun. He is the son of Vivasvat (whose light spreads afar&amp;rsquo;), who, according to EHNI, is the rising sun Yama follows the path of the sun to go to a remote recess The path of the sun&#xA;Also, A&#xA;J.&#xA;8 J Eixi, Der vedische Afythus des lama, 43-45, 61-72 Carnov, JAOS 36, 917&#xA;16&#xA;122&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;was a symbol of the path of human life, and, as a matter of fact, the same words were often used in the Veda for the death of man and for the sunset Of the sun it is said that it is the sure retreat. The sun is a bird and, like Yama, has birds as his messengers Like the sun god, Yama has two steeds, golden eyed and iron hoofed Vivasvat and Yama, who are related as father and son, stand, according to EHNI, respectively for the sun whose heaven 18 visible and the sun whose heaven is not visible This explains the suggested contrast between Vivasvat or the sun and Yama (AV XVIII 2 32, VS 24 1, SPB XIII 2 2 7) EHNI further speaks of Yama as the sun god and Yami as the moon goddess 10&#xA;Yama&amp;rsquo;s character as a sun god, in one form or another, is accepted by several other scholars MAX MULLER, 1 for instance regards Yama as the god of the setting sun and, as such the leader of the Fathers According to WEBER, Yama represents the parting day and Yami the night 12 KUHN 13 and BERGAI GNE4 think that Yama is a form of Agni, particularly the lightning Agni 15 This difference of opinion itself indicates that the solar character of Yama is not at all clear BLOOMFIELD seems to support the solar character of Yama on the basis of the description of his two dogs According to that scholar, the two&#xA;9 EHNI, OD 6st, 26&#xA;10 EHNI, Op cit, 45 ff Also see EHNI, Die ursprunglische Gotthet des vedisch en rama, Leipzig, 1896&#xA;11 Max MUELLER India What can it teach us?, 224, also 219, Lectures on the Science of Language II, 563&#xA;12 Vedische Be frage EHNI(Der ved sche Mythus des Yama 45 ) refers to the view of Max MUELLER, according to which Vivasvat is the sky, Saranyu the dawn, Yama the day, and Yami the night&#xA;13 KUHN ZUS I 430, Die Herabkunft des Feuers und des Gallerranks,&#xA;208&#xA;14 BERCAIGNE LRV I, 89 ft&#xA;15 Yaska and Sayana give, in different contexts different explanations of the nature of Yama Their most common explanation however, 13 that Yama is the lightning Agni Nurukta XII 9 understands Yama as the light ing Agni and Yaml as the sound of thuader (madhyamath ca madhyamkum ca vecam !! narutih) Clṣcwhert (Nor Y 20 ) agnir api jama ugale Suyana on RV I 1646 and X. 123 6 understands Yama as the lightning&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;123&#xA;Hogs of Yama represent day and night or the sun and the moon 10&#xA;A closer scrutiny of the descriptions of the dogs, however, shows that they are rather the outcome of a typical motif in primutive cult about death and of the common fantasy regarding the abode of the dead Their description is too minute to mistake them for any natural phenomena&#xA;HILLEBRANDT&amp;rsquo;s starting point is the fact that Yama is the son of Vivasyat, whom that scholar regards as the sun god He further pays particular attention to the contrast between Yama and Vivasvat, which is often emphasised in the Vedic mythology and ritual 18 These facts, according to HILLEBRANDT, conclusively prove that Yama cangot be the sun god EHNI&amp;rsquo;s explanation 10 regard to the contrast between the two19 is quite artificial and unconvincing That Yama is a &amp;lsquo;god&amp;rsquo;, and not an ordinary&#xA;human being,&amp;rsquo; is clear from several passages in the Veda Still Yama is said to be the first mortal&amp;rsquo; who dies These two characteristics of Yama&amp;rsquo;s personality, namely that he is an offspr ing of the sun and that he dies,&amp;rsquo; will be properly understood, according to HILLEBRANDT, only on the assumption that Yama represents the moon god 20 The moon owes his splendour to the sun and is, therefore, the sun&amp;rsquo;s child The moon is also seen to wane by digits until he becomes complctely extinct and again begins to grow This is poetically described as the periodical&#xA;1G BLOOYFELD &amp;ldquo;The two dogs of Sama&amp;rsquo;, JAOS 15 163-172 Also, The Regon of the Vedt 10. SIECKE (Pushan, 44 ) also considers Yama&amp;rsquo;s dogs to be the sun and the moon VLAX MUELLER ( Lectures on the Science of Language II, 523) takes Yama s dogs to represent Tune in its double aspect As morning and cvca ng According to Lirvi (Der Ledische Mythus des rama, 138 ff), the suramey tu arc the two wind gods VEBER thinks that the dogs ICFESTNI a stric cpixielauon and VARDAICNE (LRV 1,93 ) set in them forms of Yama and Yami According to N ARYANCAR (Indo Aryar Alythology&#xA;1 207) Sama s dogs are Asvipau or Agrusomau ARASAN (Rudra, 257 ff) conuders them to be ic[incl vcrsons of tbcromorphic death-deraons&#xA;17 HILLEBRANDT 1 cdische Afull alogic II 355-72&#xA;18 According to IIILLEBRANDT (Opal, 361), Vivasvat reprexnus life ( the day) and Yama represents death ( = thc nght)&#xA;19 Sec supra&#xA;20 N ARANGAR Ako suggests (Indo-Iryan Asthology I 201, 206) that Yuma is the moon sprung from the sun According to huma, Yami s Robipl.&#xA;12&#xA;124&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;death and birth of the moon HILLEBRANDT points to several Vedic passages where the moon is said to be the child of the sun (TX 93 1. AB VIII 28 14 ),21 and where he is referred to as dying and being reborn (I 164 4, X 55 5,85 19, ŚŚS 16 5) In support of his theory HILLEBRANDT further produces con siderable anthropological evidence from the writings of BRINTON, GRABNER, CROOKE, FRAZER, EHRENREICH, HARTLAND, and others 22 &amp;ldquo;The primitive people all over the world often connect the phases of the moon with death, birth, regeneration, etc, and consequently regard the moon as the lord of the dead fathers Yama&amp;rsquo;s part with reference to sacrifice is explained by HILLEBRA NDT also on the basis of his being the moon god for, the moon 3S the messenger of sacrifice, bripgs order in seasons, and distributes offerings anong the gods (I 105 4) Takıog for granted that Soma and Brhaspati also represent the moon god, HILLEBRANDT further quotes Vedic passages (like IX 2 10) wherein they are closely associated with sacrifice, and concludes that these ritualistic features are transferred to Yama because all the three gods represent but one divinity Yıma, the Avestan counterpart of Yama, is, according to HILLEBRANDT, closer to the moon god His final conclusion is that the lunar character of Yama was sot clearly realised by Vedic poets, who emphasised only one aspect of his personality, namely, his connection with the dead Yama was the moon god of the Indo Iranian or even earlier period Only in certain typical passages in the Veda do we still find the traces of Yama&amp;rsquo;s ancient majesty as the moon. god&#xA;The theories, which make Yama represent one natural pheno menop or another, may be regarded as cancelling one another HILLEBRANDT has made it quite clear that Yama cannot be the sun god The apparent solar features of the Yama mythology referred to by EHNI and others are the outcome of the poetic con vention in the Veda, which was dominated by solar myths They&#xA;21 As for the first passage, HILLEBRANDT take for granted the equation, Soma = the moon in the second passage candramas is clearly mentioned&#xA;22 Op al, fa l on 363&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;125&#xA;do not indicate the intrinsic character of Yama The.solarisation&amp;rsquo; of mythological elements, which are originally of an altogether different nature, is a normal feature of Vedic religion Indeed, such solarisation, which is often artificial serves some specific purpose ? At the same time it can also be shown that Yama did not originally represent even the moon god The character and function of Vivasvat, in the Veda and the Avesta, are very vague, and the statements regarding his relationship with Yama are characterised by contradiction and inconsistency (AV XVII 2 32, 3 61 62 ) 24 No theory based on Vivasvat&amp;rsquo;s solar character and his connection with Yama can therefore, be in any way con vincing Moreover, Yama is represented in the Veda as possessing so very markedly human features that it is difficult to believe that it is merely a case of normal anthropomorphism To explain Yama&amp;rsquo;s death on the basis of the satural phenomenon of the moon s phases is again not in the least satisfactory Firstly, Yama is never described as being reborn after his death like the moon He is never said to be undergoing periodical death and regeneration 25 Secondly, Yana s death unlike that of the moon, is of the nature of self immolation and serves a definite purpose Yama is, again, not only the first to die, but he is also the first parent of the human race, which fact does not fit well, even anthropologically, in the moon theory Yama&amp;rsquo;s role as the first sacrificer is of special significance He is not, like the moon, merely a messenger of sacrifice or anything of that sort He is both the sacrificer and the sacrificed and as such as more intrinsi cally connected with sacrifice To bring forth references to Soma and Bghaspati in support of the connection of the moon with sacrifice amounts to depending on unproved assumptions Any attempt to prove Yama s solar or lunar character on the evidence of the Avestan Yıma mythology is, again, bound to fail, for, Yıma&#xA;23 As for instance in the case of V 19nu (sce elsсwhere in th 3 Volume)&#xA;24 Also relevant in this connection are RV X 17 1-2 BLOouIFTELD regards these two stanzas as riddle stanzas (The Rul gion of the ledus 141, JAO$ 15 172 ff)&#xA;25 &amp;ldquo;The same may be said in regard to the setting of the sun and ama s death126&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;is all along described to have distinctly possessed the personality of a human sovereign The myth of Yama and Yami as the first parents of the human race becomes entirely meaningless if that pair were assumed to be representing specific natural phenomena The tone of the whole dialogue between the twin brother and sister is unmistakably human and its theme is, without doubt, the procreation of mankind HILLEBRANDT&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that Yama, the son of Vivasvat, should be distisguished from Yama, the brother of Yami 26 cannot possibly be accepted — indeed, it is discarded by all other scholars — and only indicates the weakness of his hypothesis Finally, the naturalistic&amp;rsquo; theories about Yama entirely disregard the true significance of the name, Yama The derivation and the explanation of the name given by EHNI and HILLEBRANDT are linguistically defective It may also be pointed out that, in a Vedic passage (X 64 3), Yama 15 distinguished from the sun and the moon in very clear terms 27&#xA;One fact thus becomes absolutely self evident as the result of our foregoing investigations, namely, that Yama did not, at any stage, represent any natural phenomenon While, therefore, discarding the naturalistic interpretations of the Yama mythology, ROTH also denies Yama s divine character 28 HOPKINS follows the lead given by ROTH and traces in detail the whole develop ment of Yama&amp;rsquo;s personality and functions According to that scholar Yama is the first human being and as such becomes, with Yami the progenitor of the human race He is incidentally the first sacrificer as also the first earthly king and ruler 29 As Yam3 was the first human being to be born, the Vedic poets naively regarded him also as the first human being to die The next patural step was to regard the first mortal who died as the founder of a new colony of the dead where all who died subsequently had to go Yama the first to be born and the first to die thus be comes the guide, the pathfinder, and the lord of the departed souls&#xA;26 Opc!, 361 27 In the JD (I 28 ) also Yama is distinguished from the moon 28 2DVC 4 425 T Ind Stud 14, 392 29 Hopkins, The Rol g ons of India 127 iT, PAOS 1891, xcivf.&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;127&#xA;In course of time he almost comes to represent the ideal side of ancestor worship He becomes the poetic or symbolic image of all fathers It is this phase of the Yama mythology, which is primarily represented in the Veda Yama&amp;rsquo;s comparison with Avestan Yıma abundantly supports this view&#xA;A more or less similar view is put forth by OLDENBERGS and SCHERMAN 31 According to OLDENBERG the original character of Yama is that of the first ruler rather than that of the first sacrificer Yama, like Yıma, was a king in a golden period OLDENBERG further points out that men in that golden period, who lived with Yama on the earth, also went to thc other world, where he ruled as the king of the dead, and became his special companions Angirases and others ( X 14 ) may thus be said to have belonged to Yama&amp;rsquo;s first order of noblemen SCHERMAN believes that Yama was originally a human figure, who was later elevated to the status of, if not identified with, the sun god That scholar disputes the generally accepted opinion that, ia the early period, Yama was a kindly sovereign, who, in later times, became the dread king of horrible hells $2&#xA;Compared with the naturalistic&amp;rsquo; theories, these “humanistic&amp;rsquo; theories regarding Yama seem to come closer to the true interpre tation of the Yama-mythology 33 But they too can be accepted, not in all their details, but only partially Their insistence on the human character of Yama is based on the fact that Yama is never mentioned as god in the Veda But they do not seem to have pro perly estimated the other fact as well, namely, that Yama is also never mentioned as a map He is a mortal&amp;rsquo;, and, as CARNOY&#xA;30 OLDENBERG, NAV, 122 2807, 592 r ctc&#xA;31 L SCHERBIAN &amp;ldquo;Eine Art vestona rer Hollenschilderung aus dem in dischen Mittelalter K Hofman Festschrit, 573 fl, Alatenal en zur Geschichte der Visionshilmatur, 13 ff&#xA;39 CE HOPKNS, The Religions of India 134–35&#xA;33 According to MILYER ( Indogermanusche Alythm I 229 T ) Sama tib twin is the alter ego of the living manL D BARNETT revives (BSOS IV 703 16 ) the Vedic and Avestan data relating to Tama and Gandharya and considers the possibility of connecting them with Glaucussaga&#xA;128&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;has pointed out,34 according to the primitive belief, &amp;lsquo;man&amp;rsquo;

is Dot the result of naive speculation Yama dics first, not because he is born first, but because he immolates himself as a pecessary condition for the procreation of mankind Undue emphasis 15 placed, in these theories, on an incidental aspect, namely, Yama&amp;rsquo;s kingdom in paradise The part played by Yama with reference to the creation of the universe and the procreation of the human race and also his special connection with sacrifice are not adequa tely explained on the assumption that Yama was just a human being, who died first and as such attained to heaven before every one else and thus became the lord of the paradisial abode of the blessed souls Yama, as a matter of fact, possesses, in the Vedic mythology, the peculiar character of a &amp;lsquo;god man&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Yama&amp;rsquo;s personality as a whole cannot thus be satisfactonly explained on the basis of the sun theory or the moon theory, or the first man theory The Yama mythology is far too complex to be comprehended by any such simple formula The Vedic poetry and the Vedic mythology are, to a very considerable extent, domina ted by artificial poetic and priestly conventions The original nature of the myths is, therefore often shrouded in a large Amount of extraneous and conventional details, which, many times, give those myths quite a different appearance It is only in certain typical references to a Vedic god, which are usually stray and scattered, and which are, therefore, regarded as inconsistent and obscure, that we have to seek for the traces of the true character of that god There are, in the Veda, some passages, which have luckily escaped priestly revision and have retained their original form Such passages have, in most cases, provided the proper starting point for the reinterpretation of Vedic mytho logy This is particularly the case with regard to the so-called&#xA;31 JAOS 36, 316,&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;129&#xA;minor gods of the Vedic pantheon Another point which should be noted in this connection is that, besides comparative philology, new research in comparative mythology has pecessarily to keep pace with and take into account the remarkable progress that has been made in anthropology and folklore&#xA;We shall start our present investigation with the study of a reference to Yama, which is usually considered to be obscure and vague In X 13 4, we read&#xA;deiebhyah kam asrnita mrfyum prajáyai kam amrtam&#xA;nairita/ brhaspatım yajñan akrmata rsim prijan jamas tam am&#xA;prarırecitll “For the sake of the gods, verily, (he) chose death, (he) chose not, indeed, 19 the interest of progeny, a life immortal They (gods) made Brhaspati, the Rsi (himself ), sacrificial offering Yana surrendered his (asyn) dear body &amp;quot; It is not necessary to reproduce here the ample evidence in support of Yama&amp;rsquo;s original divine character 38 Yama was one among the gods, accordingly, he too was endowed with the normal immorta lity of gods As a matter of fact, in another stray passage (1 83 5 ), there is a clear mention of Yama&amp;rsquo;s intrinsic immorta lity On this background, let us critically examine the reference in X 13 4 In spite of his natural immortality, Yama is said to have discarded it and surrendered his own dear body in sacrifice Through this act of self immolation, Yama served the cause of the gods and progeny alıke As would seem quite clear, the gods organised this sacrifice for the sake of the creation of the universe and the procreation of the human race On that occasion, Yama, we are told, offered himself as the sacrificial offering Out of this self offering originated the praja The second half of the Rk indicates that Yama was, for that sacrifice, which we may now call the primeval sacrifice, himself the Brhaspati, the principal priest and sacrificer The motif of a cosmic human sacrifice as&#xA;I 164 46, X 13 4,14 3,7, 21 5,52 3,64 3,&#xA;35 Sec, for mistance 92 11&#xA;17&amp;rdquo;&#xA;130&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;the cause of the origin of the world and the human race is quite common in ancient cosmogonic mythologies It was believed by several primitive communities that a primeval being of divine&amp;rsquo; or cosmic character, but possessing a human form, was immolated in a sacrifice and out of his limbs originated the several aspects of creation Reference may be made in this connection, among others, to the Babylonian myth of the creation of the heaven and the earth from the two halves of Goddess Tiāmat, and to a similar myth about the giant Banio It is highly instructive to consider in this context the ancient Germanic myth of Tusto and Ymir In Edda (II), we are told that in the primeval times when Ymjr lived, when there was neither sand por sea, neither earth 1101 heaven above, from Ymir&amp;rsquo;s flesh was the earth created, out of his blood the ocean, mountains from his bones and trees from his hair, from his skull the heaven originated&amp;rsquo; This motif, it may be pointed out, is common to several ancient mythologies, ipdogermanic and non indogermanic 38&#xA;So far as the RV is concerned we find two main versions of this cosmogonic mythological motif of the primeval sacrifice - one in the reference to Yama in X 13 4 and the other in the famous Purusasukta 37 The latter may be said to be merely a more detai ed and more elaborate priestly form of the former According to the version in X 13 4 it is one of the gods himself who surrenders his own body for sacrificial immolation thus serving the cause of the gods and progeny alike That god, Yama, is thus different from the other gods This unique character of Yama is indicated in the RV by the fact that that Veda refers to him not as a god (because he surrenders his immortality) nor as a man (because his act of self immolation for the sake of creation is far&#xA;36 Tor a detailed statement on the subject sec GUENTERT, Der arische JVelikontig und Haland 315 ff It is suggested that such cosmogopuc motif may have artsen out of some primitive fertility cult&#xA;37 This suggestion and its further claboration must be regarded as an outstanding contr bution of GUENTERT (OD cut 315 ff to the study of Vedic religion Cf herre RPVU, Appendix B, 619 21 As for this motif a rele rence may also be made to X 81 5 ff where the creator Visvakarman 15 asked to offer himself in the primeval sacrifice&#xA;YAMA IN THE YEDA&#xA;131&#xA;too &amp;lsquo;cosmic&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;divine&amp;rsquo; for an ordinary human being but simply as a martja The two conceptions of cosmic&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;divine on the one hand and human&amp;rsquo; on the other are thus tactfully represented there In The Purusasukta, the offering in the primeval sacrifice of the gods is said to have been the agrarah jāta purusa (X 90 7), whose description, such as sahasrasırsan sahasraksa, etc (X 90 1), however, indicates that his character was quite different from that of the ordinary purusas This purusa is again amrtariasja iśana and compreheods everything Thus, here too, an attempt is made to preserve the above mentioned conception of cosmic, divine nature and human form, which are common in all myths about the primeval sacrifice The basic motif in the cse of Yama and Purusa is thus the same, namely, the immola.&#xA;tion of a god man for the sake of creation 38&#xA;There is another significant conception, which is often asso ciated with the motif of the immolation of the primeval being Just as the primeval being is regarded to possess the nature of&#xA;god man&amp;rsquo;, so too it is regarded to possess the nature of a male female or of a hermaphrodite 38&#xA;The character of the Purusa as a sexually unseparated being is made evident by the opening verses of the Purusasukta and by the fact that the Purusa creates out of himself a female form, viraj In the case of Yama, on the other hand, his androgynous charac ter is not directly mentioned But it can certainly be assumed on the strength of the evidence of the analogies of other primitive mythologies and of the evidence deriyed from the linguistic consi.&#xA;38 It is of course difficult to accept y Norman Brown&amp;rsquo;s suggestion (40S 51, 108-18 that Purusa in the Purgasukta is a blend of eledcats drawn from Ago), Surya, and Visou fused in a rather shadowy way, 10 a new unity with special reference to the sun or is it necessary to assume, 2 LARRARKAR doet (7BBRAS 18, 91-93) that the idea of the Purura sacrifice 24 an attempt on the part of the Aryans to compromisc with the Proto-Draysdians of Mohoujo-Daro&#xA;99 As GUENTERT has pointed out (O ct 320 ), Tuxto and Ymir of the ancient Nordic people, Agdistis of 1bc l&amp;rsquo;honcceans Phares or Mise of the Orpbiks Zrvan of the Zervanitos, among others are all forms of an andro Synous primeval being&#xA;132&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;deration of the name Yama As GUNTERT has clearly pointed out,40 the word yama can be linguistically connected with two series of words - on the one hand, with Ay yema, Lett jumis Mir emuin, all meaning twins&amp;rsquo;, and on the other, with Lat geminus, gemelhes and Gk didumos, which mean both twin&amp;rsquo; and *hermaphrodite&amp;rsquo; A closer examination of the words of this type indicates that the two conceptions of twin and bisexual being are usually represented by similar words GUNTERT&amp;rsquo;s thorough investigation of the name Ymir and the Icelandic mythology associated with that name is very colightening in this respect Ymir of the Edda and Yama of the Veda are mythologically as also linguistically (morphologically and phonetically) related to each other They are the two Indogermanic representations of the basic motif of a hermaphrodite primeval being offering itself for immolation 10 sacrifice for the sake of the creation of the Universe and human race 12 The Purusa of the Purusasukta is only a priestly modification of the original mythical conception of Yama It may be pointed out that the same cosmogonic motif of an androgynous Urwesen is also represented in the Brhad Up I 4, where we read ārma ve idam agra ásit purusavidhah sa ha etāvān asa yathā stripumāmsau samparisvahtau of a similar purport are further the passages in the Kath (XIII 7), where Prajāpati is said to have assumed a bisexual form because he did not have any other person for pairing, and in the Art Br ([[[ 33 ). according to which, Prajāpati appears in the form of an antelope united with his sister 43&#xA;This is the first stage in the evolution of the Yama mythology to be noticed in the RY The primitive conception of a herma - phrodite primeval being as the creator of the universe and the&#xA;40 Op at, 334 41 Opal, 326 ft&#xA;42 GUENTERT refers in this connection to Daias of the Phrygian mytho logy and citerates hus favourite theory that on the strength of the evidence of comparabic mythology, it can be proud that in pre historic times there must have exuted a close contact among the Germanic the Thrako Scythiad and the Aryan peoples&#xA;43 &amp;lsquo;The myth of Manu and I also ) significant in this context&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;133&#xA;&amp;lsquo;ogenitor of the human race, which characterises this stage, is iggested by the name, Yama, which basically means a bisexual eing, and by the fact that the counterparts of Yama in other rimitive cosmogonic mythologies possess a similar character. It nust, however, be said that, as it has happened in several other ases in the Veda, the originally very expressive name of Yama &amp;gt;st its basic significance and it soon degenerated into a colourless ppellation The other current of thought, which characterises his stage, namely, the immolation of the god man for the sake of reation is happily preserved in a clear reference to Yama&amp;rsquo;s self mmolation in X 13 4 The connection of Yama with sacrifice s thus of a very special nature He is the first sacrificer, the first o stretch the web of mankind and sacrifice (VII 33 9-10), which was further extended by Vasistha He was also the first to serve as the sacrificial offering All this alone would rationally explain why in certain stray passages, which are otherwise obscure,&#xA;sama is so highly elevated with reference to jajña (AV XVIII 2 32 ) The metres symbolising the magical power of sacrifice are said to be deposited in Yama (X 14 16 ) Moreover, Yama 15 also seen to have been exalted almost to the position of an All god because he was the universe itself Yama&amp;rsquo;s close relation with Ago (X 51 1-3, 64 3, 92 11) may also be explained on the basis of this motif of Yama&amp;rsquo;s primeval sacrifice&#xA;The primitivc motif of the immolation of an androgynous primeval being for the sake of the creation of the universe is, 10 some cases, found in a shghtly modified form The original myth came to be regarded as too raw and uprefined particularly with reference to the procreation of the human race The herma phrodite Urwesen, therefore, was represented to have separated itself into a male and a female, who came to be duly recognised as the first parents of mankind As these two were the offspring of the same being they were supposed to be related to each other as brother and sister They were also regarded as twins This is exactly what seems to have happened in the evolution of the Yama mythology Yama, the hermaphrodite Urnesen, gave place to a pair of twins who were regarded as the parents of&#xA;134&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;mankind &amp;quot; As the result of the peculiar linguistic phenomenon, which we have already noticed, the same word, jama, possessed the two senses of a bisexual being and a twin Even in this second stage, therefore, the name Yama was preserved to denote the male twin, though the character and function of this Yama were materially different from those of the Yama of the first stage in the development of the Yama-mythology Yama and his twin sister Yami, whose name is formed in obvious imitation of that of Yama, became the progenitors of the human race 15 Yama&amp;rsquo;s original function as the creator of the universe was thus considerably restricted This aspect of the Yama mythology, in the course of its evolution, is preserved 1n a whole hymn in the RV (X 10) It is, however, represented there in quite a different light The conception of an incestuous idtercourse between the twin brother and sister, Yama and Yami giving rise to the human race became positively offensive to the conventional moral sense of the Vedic poets and priests The real motif of that episode was, therefore, altogether changed and was presented in quite a different perspective Yama is shown there as protesting strongly against the amorous advances of his twin-sister Yami He draws Yami&amp;rsquo;s attention to the law of rta (X 10 2, 6, 8), which does not warrant an incest between brother and sister An attempt is made by the Vedic poet to suggest that Yama and Yamı were not the first parents of the human race, for, they themselves are represented to have parents, namely, the Gandharva and the Water-Nymph (X. 10 4) The poet further suggests that Yama and Yami were not the first human beings by making Yama direct Yami to a person other than himself (X 10 8, 10, 12, 14), as if such a person actually existed But, 10 spite of all his efforts, the Vedic poct could not entirely obliterate from that hymn certain details, which clearly betray the true nature of that myth Yami is represented in that&#xA;44 According to the Icelandic myth, Ymir slept and from under his arm sprang up a maidea and a child&#xA;45 Yıma and Yimch are the Iranian primeval pair So are Manugak and Masyaalk&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;135&#xA;hymn as being heen - quite naturally, too - on the procreation and the furthcrance of the race The procreative instinct of the female is quite unmistakable there Moreover, a very clear men tion is made in that hymn (X 10 3 ) of the fact that Yama was the only male in existence at that time Does this not indicate that Yama was the first human being to exist ? The colourless and very impersonal character of the so called parents of Yama and Yami at oncc betrays that their inciusion, by the poet, in the hymn was obviously an afterthought The Vedic poet has tried to make the ancient myth of Yama and Yami a vehicle for a sermon on ria, moral law, - but, undoubtedly, without success For, as it is, the hymn appears to end abruptly The poet does Dot make it clear whether the incest actually took place or not, obviously because the answer to that question would have pullified the poet&amp;rsquo;s purpose There seems to be, therefore, 10 reason to doubt that the hymo contains in spite of its tendentious perver sion by the poet, which only reflects the morality of his age, unmistakable traces of a distinct form of the Yama mythology, according to which Yama and Yami, the twin brother and sister, Were considered to be responsible for the procreation of the human race through an inccstuous union&#xA;The motif of the androgynous Urucsen separating itself is clearly preserved in the Purusasūkta The Urncsen (Purusa) created out of itself a female form, traj,&amp;rsquo; who, in her turn, produced thc purusa, who may be regarded as the symbol of further procrtation (X. 90 5) The primeval Purusa is thus at once made responsible for the creation of the macrocosm as well as microcosm - of course, in different ways it will be seen that tbc self immolation of the biscrual Yama, representing the Grst stage in the csolution of the Yama mythology, as also the myth of the twins, Yama and Yami, procrcating the human race, which represents the second stage, arc both prcscrved, in a modificd form, in thc Purusasūkta Though Yama&amp;rsquo;s onginal character as a hermapbrodite god man and as the first tivin parcot 15 relegated&#xA;46 Adam is said to have produced Est out of bu own rib136&#xA;VEDIC MYTIIOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;to stray and obscurc refcrcnccs,&amp;rsquo;t it has been, so to say, resurrec. ted in the form of the Puruṣa of the Purusasūkta The ongios1 Yama myth and the Purusa myth arc thus organically connected with cach other&#xA;It cannot, however, be denied that there was among the con ventional Vedic priests and roots a strong prejudice against this myth of an inccstuous union between the tuns As the result of this prcjudice of the Vedic hicrarchy, Yami disappeared from the Yama mythology as silently as she was introduced in it No further rcference to Tami is available in the RI&amp;rsquo; Conscqucotly, out of the pair of twins Yama alonc remained as the arst bora progenitor of mankind Associated with this progenitorship of the human racc nc find, in the Veda, also faint traces of Yama&amp;rsquo;s sovereignty on carth Himself a mortal&amp;rsquo;, Yama is regarded as the leader of the human fact, its king ruling in an earthly paradise This aspect is specially emphasised in the case of Yama&amp;rsquo;s Iranian counterpart, Yım (Jamshed) who, according to Vd II 4-19, was the kingly ruler in whose rciga the golden age of the world prevailed &amp;quot; It was from Ahura Mazdah limself that Yıma received the command to further and increase the world The plenitude of life and increase on earth form the dominating features of Yama&amp;rsquo;s rule No special reference is made to this aspect of the Yama mythology in the Veda There arc, all the same, some indications which unmistakably point to it. The possession by Yama of the padbisa (X 97 16), which corres ponds to the pasa of Varuṇa and which may be regarded as the symbol of sovereignty, seems to be one of the remnants of Yama s kingship Yama&amp;rsquo;s particular association with Varuṇa (X 14 7), who, in course of time, came to be regarded as the typical sovereigo in the Vedic mythology, can be adequately&#xA;47 It is gniGcant that such references are to be found mostly 13 mandalas 1 and 10, and not in the hicrarclucal family books.&#xA;48 As scen elewhere according to OLDENBERG it u the characteristic of Yama s personality that is original in the Veda&#xA;49 Attention may be drawn also to H COLLITZ : article König lama und Saturn, Oriental Studies a hmour of CS Patry, 86-108&#xA;YAMA IN THE VEDA&#xA;137&#xA;lajoed only on the basis of the former&amp;rsquo;s own sovereignty The Iception of sovereignty over mankind is a natural extension of conception of progenitorship of mankind This assumption is firmed by analogous phenomena in other primitive mytho&#xA;les 50&#xA;Another myth about the progenitor of the human race was, oul this time, being developed in the Vedic mythology - the th of Manu, the first man Manu is mentioned in the Veda as : father of the human race (1 80 16 ) and as the first sacrificer III 43 13, X 63 7) The legend of Manu&amp;rsquo;s deliverance from dood by the fish (SPB I 8 1 1) clearly 10dicates his function the progenitor and leader of mankind 51 He is the son of vasvat, and Manu Vaivasvata came to be regarded as the symbol the first man&amp;rsquo;, the first sacrificer&amp;rsquo;, and the first ruler&amp;rsquo;. anu was thus more or less a &amp;lsquo;double&amp;rsquo; of Yama. There was, erefore, naturally enough, considerable mutual interaction tween the Manu myth and the Yama myth To begin with, the lapu myth completely overshadowed the stage in the develop cnt of the Yama mythology, which has just been referred to ama&amp;rsquo;s character as the progenitor and the first sovereign of the uman race was almost relegated to oblivion and can now only e inferred from stray references to it in the Veda The strong rejudice of the Vedic hierarchy against the Yama Yami myth had Tready prepared the ground for this The legends of Many were uch as could easily conform to the conventional attitude of the &amp;rsquo;edic poet-priests The mour of incest in the Yama mythology Cems to have been particularly responsible for the withdrawal of&#xA;50 As A V WILLIAM JACASOY point out (140S 17. 18.07), a passage At the safisharala (111 142 35 IT - Cnt Cd, App I, 16 70-81 ) VIYOS ho characterutic feature of Xanas fxcrsonality, wluch is only family suf tested in de leida The description of the said of ama in the Alahut#ra.a (118) further reminds us of the fara of Avestan lima&#xA;51 Vanu acumes a rolc sitlar to that of Adam as well as hoah Ja Te Yinns mythology, there is a confused corob gatron of dc Vanu legend Ind the Yama legend Bima&amp;rsquo;s tard ensures xcurity against flood is also imply rurrounds she good&#xA;18&#xA;138&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;Yama from the Vedic cosmogonic mythology and the priestly emphasis on Yama&amp;rsquo;s double, Manu, as the first man Yama&amp;rsquo;s role of the first sacrificer, which was associated with the myth of the primeval sacrifice of the hermaphrodite god man, soon became Tepulsive to the Vedic priests and poets, and thereafter, came to be transferred to Manu Secondly, the parallelism between the Yama myth and the Purusa myth helped to bring the Yama myth and the Manu myth close together This was due to a peculiar linguistic fact The word Manu is employed to denote specifically the progenitor of the human race as well as man in gederal That word and the word purusa, which also signifies man, were thus more or less synonymous Yama and Purusa, on the other hand, were almost identical in personality and character The natural next step from these two equations - the linguistic equie tion, Purusa = Manu, and the mythological equation, Purusa = Yama - was to closely associate Yama and Manu We have already pointed out the simularity between the myths of Yama and&#xA;There 18 thus considerable intermixture of mythical motifs and names in the whole Yama Purusa Manu-mythology It may be assumed that the original nature and functions of Yama, wbich were tendentiously put into the background as the result of the Vedic conventionalism, did persist, albert 10 a modified form, through Parusa and Manu&#xA;Beforc Yama was completely superseded by Manu in tre progenitorship of the human race, the two myths existed side by side and the necessity was felt to adjust thern somehow or other The efforts in this direction, which are quite obvious in the Vedic mythology, themselves form an evidence in support of Yamas role as the progenitor of mankind In the Vedic mythology Yama and Manu came to be regarded as brothers - both sons of Vivasvat That is how Vivasvat was introduced &amp;ndash; artificially and superficially in the Yama mythology as the father of Yama Vivasyat, we are told in RV (X 17 i ff ), married Saranyu, the daughter of Tvastr They werc the parents of Yama The gods later concealed the immortal bride, Saranyu, from the mortals, and, makiog another of like appearance, Savarna, they gave her&#xA;YAMA IN THE VÉD4&#xA;139&#xA;to Vivasvat Vivasvat and Savarnā gave birth to Manu 52 An attempt is thus made to point out that Yama and Manu were not identical, Yama was of divine birth, while Manu was not It need hardly be added that all this is obviously an after thought&#xA;In spite of all this, the Yama mythology was not completely effaced from the Vedic literature Quite an unexpected feature of Yama&amp;rsquo;s original character came to be prominently emphasised and was interpreted in an altogether different light Yama, as we bave seen, offered himself for immolation in the primeval sacrifice, for the sake of the gods and progeny Out of the three conceptions included in this cosmogonic myth, pamely, that of the hermaphrodite primeval god man, that of the creation of the universe and the human race, and that of the self immolation, it was the last that pow came to be stressed Yama inmolated himself at the beginning of existence, that is to say, in other words, Yama was the first being to die The adjustment between the Manu myth and the Yama myth was thus considerably simpli fied Many was the first born&amp;rsquo;, Yama was the first to die The further evolution of the Yama mythology is clearly traceable in the Veda Yama dies first and attains to heaven before every one else Leaviog the kragdom of earthly paradise, he assumes the sovereignty of the heavenly paradise He is the forerunner of all the departed souls and becomes their guide and pathfinder There he rules over the blessed ones, as the benevolent father of * fathers&amp;rsquo;, and is worshipped, with the pitts, as thc first witness of an immortality, to be enjoyed by the fathers, similar to the im mortality cojoyed by the gods themselves One point should be clearly borne in mind in this connection, and it is that, though Yama is closely associated with the spirits of the dead, he never assumes the horrific role of the demon of death It is this stage in the evolution of the Yama mythology, pamely, of Yama as the ruler of the blessed dead, tliat is primarily represented in the RV A significant feature of the primitive cult about the dead and their&#xA;52 On 17 1-2, see BLOOMFIELD, 3 IOS 15, 172 fT Thu Icgend 1 narrated in Murukta Xit 10 ff and 19 Bhaddctata VI, 162–63.&#xA;140&#xA;VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS&#xA;ruler, namely, the conception of the two dogs guardiog the region of the dead, is now transplanted upon the Yama mythology -&#xA;It was at this stage that the Rudra mythology seems to have significantly reacted on the Yama mythology 54 Consequently Yama&amp;rsquo;s association with death&amp;rsquo; as such began to figure rather prominently Death is said to be Yama&amp;rsquo;s puth (1 38 5) Yama is mentioned side by side with Mrtyu and Antaka, and is even identified with Mrtyu (X 165 4, MIS II 5 6, AV, VI 28 3, 93 1) The benevolent ruler of the blessed souls, the helpful father of &amp;lsquo;fathers, who had originally nothing to do with &amp;lsquo;death&amp;rsquo; as such, and whose proper function, even as represented in a later stage, commenced after death&amp;rsquo;, now came to be identified with death The dogs of death, the inauspicious messengers, ulūka and kapota the padbisa, which was now regarded as the instrument of punishment, - all these traits helped to make Yama an object of terror The conception of Yama&amp;rsquo;s role as the fearful and restraining&amp;rsquo;god of death must have been facilitated also by the popular derivation of the word jama from the root yam to restrain ), which, though normally possible, is not acceptable in this case on account of the difficulties of Vedic accentuation which it would create But it is thus aspect of Yama&amp;rsquo;s personality which has been preserved prominently in the later Hindu mytho logy&#xA;[Fust published&#xA;B.&#xA;Lais Yol, Part 1, 1915, 191–209)&#xA;53 The dogs are, as ad cated elsewhere obslously the outcome of a common pr mit vc folk belief The dog Sabala is oiten identified with ket beros Also see fr 16 aborc&#xA;54 Sca.
