      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Brā́hmaṇa period there are many such fossilizations of abstract words, which seem to be purposeful (given the purpose of Brā́hmaṇa texts as metaphysical commentaries on ritual specifically) rather than a large class of words whose meanings were entirely forgotten.  Thus we also have words like krátu &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo; that becomes &amp;ldquo;sacrifice&amp;rdquo;, or puró-hita &amp;ldquo;first-placed&amp;rdquo; that becomes &amp;ldquo;priest&amp;rdquo;, or puro-ḍā́ş &amp;ldquo;first offering&amp;rdquo; that becomes &amp;ldquo;rice-cake&amp;rdquo;, or tiró-ahnyam &amp;ldquo;throughout the day&amp;rdquo; that becomes &amp;ldquo;day-old offering&amp;rdquo; (according to Thomson).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My answer to a question asked in #vedists about war-cries in the Véda: The Mántra-s do mention war-cries or at least war-noises several times (&lt;em&gt;krándas&lt;/em&gt; R̥V 2.12.8, 6.25.4, 10.38.1, 10.121.6; &lt;em&gt;ākrandá&lt;/em&gt; AV 12.1.41; &lt;em&gt;bhára-hūti&lt;/em&gt; R̥V 1.129.2, 5.48.4, 8.63.12). Unfortunately, there is no dialogue I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered in any Mántra or Brā́hmaṇa that is explicitly indicated to be a war-cry. However, there are some invocations that seem to serve almost as war-cries. Thus the formula recited alongside the beating of war-drums (dundubhí-s, TB 1.3.6.2) before the chariot-race of the vāja-péya:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of the yugá as an æra did exist from the Mántra period, as did the the concept that later ages will be more immoral than the earlier, more Divine ones.  Thus we have quotes like this from the R̥g-vedá, using yugá: &lt;a href=&#34;https://nikhilsd.com/dvq/6/&#34;&gt;https://nikhilsd.com/dvq/6/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Names of four yugá-s also do occur twice in Brā́hmaṇa literature: Kr̥tá, Trétā, Dvāpára, and Káli (ĀiB 7.15.4) or Kr̥tá, Khā́rvā, Dvāpára, and Puṣyá (ṢB 5.6.5), with some of those names also occurring individually in earlier literature (hence accented) referring to sides of a die.  (Khā́rvā is the vŕ̥ddhi of kharvá approximately meaning &amp;ldquo;mutilated&amp;rdquo;.  Puṣyá is the name of a constellation, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what its meaning would be with that accent.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
