  <p>By far the most important of the agent gods is Tvastṛ, who is mentioned some sixty-five times in the Rigveda, most often in the late first and tenth books, but also in the family books, though rarely in the seventh of the Vasistha family, and in the eighth. Like the other gods of the Rigveda he goes to the heaven, and bestows blessings, but his characteristic feature is the</p>

<p>termed Animism or Polydaemonism. To trace to it the origin of all religion is unscientific: it naturally connects with other forms as in early Babylonian religion (Farnell, Greece and Babylon, pp. 42, 48); it is not earlier than the animatistic worship of natural powers,</p>

<p>and it has a different psychological aspect; cf. Carnoy, Les Indo-Européens, p. 217. See above, pp. 71 ff.</p>

<p>iron axe, which he bears in his hand, and which marks him out as the skilled artificer. He forges the bolt of Indra, and the axe of Brahmanaspati, and especially the cup out of which the gods drink. He is, further, the power which shapes the germ in the womb for men and animals alike: he fashions husband and wife for each other from the womb, and presides over generation: so in the later Vedic texts 1 he is constantly mentioned in connexion with the making of forms, and the pairing of men and animals. These texts also ascribe to him the production of the horse.</p>
<p>Tvaṣtṛ stands in special relation to the human race in that his daughter Saranyű, wife of Vivasvant, produced the twins, Yama and Yamî, whence came the human race. He is also father of Bṛhaspati, of Agni, and even of Indra, who, however, seems to have slain him for withholding from him the Soma. Indra also was hostile to Viśvarupa, the three-headed son of Tvaṣtṛ, from whom he sought to win the cows: he slew Viśvarūpa, and, when Tvaṣtṛ in anger refused to allow him to take part in his Soma sacrifice, Indra came and drank the Soma by force. As Tvaṣtṛ is himself called more often than any other god Viśvarupa, it is difficult not to suspect that the connexion of Tvaṣṭr with Viśvarupa of the three heads is due to the similarity of name, and it is perhaps hence that there arises the hostility between Tvastṛ and Indra: the old character of the Viśvarupa myth is vouched for by its Indo- European parallels. As son in law of Tvastṛ Vayu once is mentioned.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>In the Rigveda Tvaṣtṛ is normally mentioned along with gods of similar character, such as Savitṛ, Dhātṛ, Prajāpati, and, less naturally, Pûṣan. With Savitṛ he is twice indeed, it seems, identified in the phrase &lsquo;god Tvastr, the stimulator, omniform,&rsquo; and the identification with Savity and Prajāpati is asserted in the Kauśika Sūtra.a</p>
<p>5 In the ritual his most prominent</p>
<p>feature is his combination with the divine ladies, who seem to be the wives of the gods, presumably because of his connexion with generation. We hear also of his daughters who cure Indra&rsquo;s ophthalmic sleeplessness, and evoke him from a cow in which he takes refuge from Vṛtra, thus becoming his mothers.&quot;</p>
<p>It results also from the special position of Tvaṣṭr with regard to generation that, when in the Soma ritual at a certain point in the rite the wife of the sacrificer comes up to perform an act intended to be symbolic, and productive of the process of generation, she is brought up by the Nestr, the priest who stands in the closest relations to the god.&quot;</p>
<p>The etymological sense of Tvastṛ seems clear: it is formed from a root tvaks, which has a parallel in the Avesta, and which has the sense of fashion, like the normal taks. Oldenberg considers that the god is no more than the personification of creative activity, and so far as the Rigveda goes it</p>

<p>[Part II</p>
<p>seems difficult to deny that this theory is adequate. On the other hand Hillebrandt,1 who, for no adequate reason, suggests that the etymology may be really from some aboriginal word, is strongly of opinion that the mythical conception is the concrete one of the sun, his son Viśvarupa being the moon. The theory is open as regards Viśvarūpa to fatal difficulty, but there is no objection, having regard to the case of Savitṛ, to see in Tvaṣtṛ another case of an agent god, who has come into separate existence from being at first merely an epithet of a more concrete divinity. The post-Vedic mythology indeed regards him as an Aditya, but this fact is of very little consequence. Ludwig * takes him to be a god of the year, but this is obviously much less likely than the suggestion of the sun as a great creative power.</p>
<p>Tvaṣtṛ figures also in the myth of the Ṛbhus making his cup into four; even if the cup be the moon, as is possible, it does not shed any light either on the original nature of Tvaṣtṛ or on his connexion with the moon.</p>
<p>The other agent gods are of very minor importance. Dhatṛ, the creator, is a development, only found about a dozen times, and only once outside the tenth book, of the epithet creator, applied to Indra or Viśvakarman, and often used of the priests as establishers of the sacrifice. He is the creator of the heaven, air, earth, sun and moon, is besought to grant offspring, a clear eye, and length of days, and in the post-Vedic period is a synonym of Brahman or Prajapati as the all-god. Vidhātṛ, &lsquo;disposer&rsquo;, is used with Dhātṛ as an epithet of Indra and Viśvakarman once each: it in two enumerations 3 attains a slight existence. With Dhātṛ in its solitary occurrence in book vii is found Dhartṛ,* &rsquo; supporter&rsquo;, elsewhere an epithet of Indra and other gods. The god Trātṛ, protector&rsquo;, is found five times with other deities, referring perhaps to Savitṛ and Bhaga: the word is usually an epithet of Indra, Agni or the Adityas. A leader god, Netṛ, is invoked in one hymn only, and asked to lead to prosperity in life. Of goddesses we have Deṣṭrī, who is invoked with Dhātṛ and Mātariśvan in the marriage hymn, and the class of protectors, Varutri, known from the Rigveda onwards.</p>

<p>§3. The Creator Gods</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Two hymns of the Rigveda are devoted to the honour of Viśvakarman, who is described as all-seeing, with eyes, face, arms, feet, on every side, a trait which is preserved in the post-Vedic representations of the god Brahman. But he is also said to have wings, and stress is laid on his being lord of speech, and the source of all prosperity. He is styled Dhātṛ, and Vidhātṛ, the establisher of earth and the disposer of the sky, and also the highest apparition.</p>

<p>The name is applied as an epithet to Indra, and to the sun as all-creating, and probably it was from the latter god that it developed into a name for the creator active god in the Brāhmaṇas 1 Viśvakarman is identic with Prajā- pati, and in post-Vedic literature he sinks to the humble level of the artificer of the gods. A class of Viśvasṛj gods, all-creators, is just alluded to in the Brāhmaṇas.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Prajapati is even a slighter figure than Viśvakarman in the Rigveda, and his name as a distinct deity occurs only four times, one late hymn being given to him.3 In that hymn, however, as it now stands, in an appended verse his supremacy is clearly asserted, and in more effective manner than in the older hymns, when they assert the greatness of one of the popular gods. He is there said to have created and established the heaven and the earth, to be the lord of all that is, the king of all that breathes and moves about, god above the gods, whose ordinances the gods and all beings obey, and who embraces all creatures. The deliberate intention to set out the nature of a creator god is expressed in the fact that the hymn is put in interrogative form, and the answer is given in the last verse. The form of the hymn is of importance as it gave rise to the most weird of the gods created by the Indian imagination in the Vedic age, the god Ka, Who?&rsquo; He is in the Brahmana literature expressly identified</p>
<p>&rsquo; with Prajapati,a but he is also in the ritual and in the Mantras distinguished from that god, separate offerings to this abstraction from a pronoun being duly provided for.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The name, Prajapati, means lord of offspring, and is applied once in the Rigveda to Savitṛ, who is described as the Prajapati of the world, and the supporter of heaven, and also to Soma as compared with Tvaṣtṛ and Indra. As a distinct deity Prajapati is naturally invoked to bestow offspring, in one case along with Viṣṇu, Tvaṣtṛ, and Dhātṛ; he is said to make cows prolific, and in the Atharvaveda and the other texts of the later literature his connexion with offspring is regularly referred to. But Prajāpati is essentially in the later Samhitas and the Brahmaṇas regarded as the chief of the gods, and in special the father god, who produces everything, who is the father of the gods on the one hand, but also of the Asuras,&quot; and who is of course the first sacrificer. Prajapati is the hero of the cosmogonic myths of the whole of the Brahmana period; he creates the worlds and the Vedas, and the castes.10 In the Sūtras he is specifically identified with Brahman,11 the god, the masculine of the idea of Brahman, &lsquo;holy prayer,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;holy power&rsquo;.

<p>Prajapati, however, is not in the slightest affected by the development of this god in the Brahmaṇas.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Of the myths in which Prajapati figures, the most interesting by far is that of his incest with his daughter Usas,1 who changed herself into a gazelle, whereupon he assumed the form of the male animal corresponding to it. In the version of the Maitrāyaṇī Samhita 2 Rudra aimed an arrow at him, but was induced to lay it aside by a promise of Prajapati to make him the lord of beasts, if he did not shoot him. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa the gods in anger at the incest of Prajapati make from the most terrible substances the form of Rudra, who shoots Prajāpati in the form of a deer, the myth being transferred to the sky, where the deer, Mṛga, the archer Mṛgavyādha, and the three-pointed arrow, Iṣu Trikāṇḍā, are pointed out. It is apparently a transfer to the god Prajapati as creator god of a legend which seems in the Rigveda 4 to be told, though in the most obscure terms of a father, who is probably to be taken as Dyaus with his daughter, presumably meant to be the earth, for an archer is alluded to in that legend. Elsewhere Prajapati is recorded to have given Uṣas in marriage to Bṛhaspati or Soma,5 or to have married all his daughters, the Nakṣatras, to Soma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prajapati also appears in other animal forms, which is in keeping with his position as the great generator: his eye swells, and, because it did so (aśvayat), the horse came into being; he assumes the form of a boar in order to raise the earth out of the waters, a legend which is recounted in the Taittiriya Samhita? and which is the starting-point of the boar incarnation of Viṣṇu, and he also assumed the form of a tortoise to produce all creatures according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, whence arises the view that all men are the children of the tortoise. He is also identified with the primeval Puruṣa or giant from whom by the sacrifice the gods created the whole of the world, and also men and the gods.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In the hymn addressed to him Prajapati bears the title of Hiranyagarbha, the golden germ, and this mention of him is itself elevated by the Atharvaveda10 and by the later literature 11 to the rank of a supreme deity. In the Atharvaveda he appears as the embryo, which is produced in the waters on the process of creation. His position is definitely identified with that of Prajapati in the Taittiriya Samhita, and in the post-Vedic literature he becomes the expression of the nature of the personal god, Brahman, as opposed to the impersonal Brahman.</p>

<p>curious way, is fond of inventing new expressions for the supreme deity. Thus it looks upon Kāla,1&rsquo;time&rsquo;, as the one existing thing in the universe, and again it invents Skambha,2 &lsquo;support&rsquo;, the necessary substratum on which the structure of the universe must rest, and exalts it to the position of a supreme god. Prāṇa,3 the breath&rsquo;, is also deified and identified with Prajapati. Another god, Rohita, is doubtless really an epithet of the sun as ‘ruddy&rsquo;, but it becomes identified by the Atharvaveda with Prajāpati: the alternative theory presented by Bloomfield that it is the development of the abstraction of red as advantageous for all those suffering from jaundice is not indeed inconceivable, but it is not necessary and, therefore, should not be preferred to the more obvious explanation which presents itself. Even in that text the Vratya,&rdquo; who is the un-brahmanical Aryan when induced to enter the Brahmanical fold by a performance of some complication, the Vratya Stomas, is celebrated as a universal god, a fact which has erroneously been interpreted as an allusion to the worship of the god Śiva by a special section of the population. The remains of the sacrificial offering are also celebrated as being the supreme god, and naturally so also the Brahmacarin or Brahman student, as well as other figures. To these aberrations of the Atharvaveda no attention is paid subsequently.</p>
<p>On the other hand the god Brahman is not found even in the Atharvaveda and still less in the other Samhitās. He may be traced merely in such later texts 10 as the Taittiriya 11 and the Kausitaki Brahmanas.12 The earlier conception in this case is unquestionably the neuter, Brahman, which denotes the prayer, the spell, and also more widely the holy power, whether embodied in the prayer or spell or manifested in the universe. The transition to the personal god is to be seen in the phrase, the world of Brahman: in its earliest occurrences that phrase may mean no more than the place of the Brahman, but it was inevitable, even if this is the case, that the idea of a personal god, whose world was meant, should have superseded the older idea. But it must be recognized that in the Vedic period there is no trace whatever of Brahman becoming a god of such importance as to supersede Prajapati. The importance of the god Brahman can be shown only for a period during the development of Buddhism, since in the Buddhist texts we find many references to Brahman as apparently a very great and popular god among the Brahmans. He bears there an epithet Sahampati, which cannot be explained by anything known in the Brāhmaṇa literature, and this suggests that he may</p>

<p>have been specially in honour among the eastern tribes of the Indians, and have received among them an epithet which is not recorded in our texts, which are essentially of the middle country lying further to the west than the home of the earliest Buddhism. It is of importance to note that in the Upanisads, where, if anywhere, the mention of Brahman as the creator god would be expected to be frequently found, it is comparatively rare, and Prajāpati is the normal name of the creator, and so in the Sutra texts also.</p>
<p>§4. Subjective Deities</p>
<p>The clearest example of what may be called physical or subjective deities in the Rigveda is Manyu, &lsquo;wrath&rsquo;, who is invoked in two hymns.1 He is described as self-existent, irresistible. He slays Vṛtra, bestows wealth, grants victory like Indra, and is accompanied by the Maruts: doubtless the conception is deduced from that of the wrath of Indra as a destructive force. Tapas, mentioned along with him, denotes ardour: the conception plays a part of the utmost importance in Vedic cosmogony, as a refined form of physical heat, but it is hardly directly deified. The Rigveda also deifies Śrāddha, &rsquo; faith,&rsquo; through which the fire of sacrifice is kindled, ghee offered, and wealth obtained, and which is invoked at morning, midday, and night. The Brāhmaṇas3 make her out to be the daughter of the sun, or of Prajapati. The conception clearly means belief in the existence and the generosity of the gods in its first appearance: its decay in the process of the religion will be dealt with later.</p>

<p>In the Atharvaveda is found the conception of Kama,&rsquo; desire &rsquo; or &rsquo;love&rsquo;. He is described as the first to be born, and he has arrows which pierce all hearts. He is not, however, as far as appears from the scanty notices we have of him a god primarily of human love, though that side of his character may have existed from the first or have been soon attributed to him. In his cosmic aspect, which is in accordance with the theosophic tone of the Atharvaveda the one in which he is described in it, he is probably derived from the mention of Kāma in one of the most important cosmogonic hymns of the Rigveda as the first seed of mind, regarded also as cosmic. It is not until the later literature in the last strata of the epic that we meet with the Indian Cupid with his arrows, who is described as the disturber of the hearts of men whom he vexes with the pangs of love.&quot;</p>
