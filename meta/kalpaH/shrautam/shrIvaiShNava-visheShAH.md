> In case of Srivaishnava shrautayagas, the Archa Vigraha of Srimanārāyaṇā shud come to the yagashala of the temple  and accept the flesh of the animals to be offered as naivedya before proceeding with the yaga.  
> Most vaiṣṇava śrauta agrahāras, like nāvalpākkam or kaṇdiyur has a yāgaśālā area for śrautayaga next to the temple as a maṇDagappadi maṇdapa or inside the temple itself. (The mandagappadi is not just for the havirnivedana but for witnessing the entire yajna.)

## Tantrika extension
> Mukkur Swamy's yajnas have been performed in both small and large venues. When the yAgashAla is small, the homa occurs in close proximity to the archA. When the yAgashAla is large, the principal archA mUrti called Yajnamurti is brought right in front of the homakunDa to witness the entire homa.
> 
> All havis are offered to the archA mUrti before homa. There are some specific mantras called havir nivedana mantras used for this (as opposed to using aShTAkShara or dvayam in typical pAncharAtra practice).
