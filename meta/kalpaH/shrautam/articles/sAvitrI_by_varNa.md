Śudrāchāra śiromaņi prescribes "tat saviturvareņyam" as sāvitrī for v1s, "deva savituh" for v2s and "viśvā rūpāņi" for v3s. I don't know a mantra that starts with "deva savituh". Also there are bunch of mantras that start with "viśvā rūpāņi".  Not sure which formulae implied here.

> since deva savituH is ungrammatical, I believe it is the subsequently mantra to the classic sAvitrI:
devasya savitur vayaM vAjayantaH purandhyA | - MT

OTOH, bodhāyana śeṣasūtra prescribes "tat saviturvareņyam" for v1s, "āsatyena rajasā" for v2s and "yuñjate mana" for v3s. All these are there in taittiriya. It's quite possible v2s and v3s abandoned their sāvitrī early on.

We have circumstantial evidence that indicates even the sāvitrī of v1s weren't fixed. A brahmavāda on sāvitrī in bŕhadāraņyaka ponders if the mantra "tat savituh" in anushtubh be taken and concludes against it in favor of the one in gāyatrī meter.

IIRC suggests each ŕṣi clan had their own sāvitrī before the vaishvāmitra one is adopted as a standard. If that's the case, we can guess what those might have been. Some candidates:

1. tadrādho adya saviturvareņyam (RV 1.159.05)
2. abhi tvā deva savitar īśānām Vāryāņām - RV 1.24.3 
3. taddevasya saviturvareņyam madahvŕņīmahe (4.53.1)
4. Vi nākam akhyatsavitā vareņyo - 5.81.2
5. The bŕhadāraņyaka reference - tat saviturvŕņīmahe - 5.82.1
