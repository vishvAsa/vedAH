In shrauta, brahmā is responsible for stomabhāga recitation "rashmirasi kshayāya tvā  kshayam jinva. pretirasi dharmāya tvā dharmam jinva...".  

The corresponding brāhmaņa in taittiriya appears to be the source Kāṭhaka expands this and Panchavimsha picks it up as an explanation for nihavasāman. The brāmana says Ŕṣis didn't see indra face to face, but vasiṣṭha did. Indra taught the stomabhāga formulas directly to him. "tasmāt vasiṣṭho brahma kāryah". TS 3.5.2.1, KS 37,17:97.

Also see aitareya 7.16.1, vasiṣṭha as brahma in shunahshepa ākhyāna.
