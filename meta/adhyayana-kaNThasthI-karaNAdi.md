## कण्ठस्थी-करणम्
### विजयोक्ता प्रक्रिया 

Standard way of teaching in the top vedic schools is as follows:

Each day 1x teaching + 19x self study.  
Volume of lesson is 50 panchashats.  
Anandhyayana dinas are Amavasya/Paurnami, prathamA, aShThamI, chaturdashI.  
Classic style - 1 santhai per day for 10 days. Guru recites. Shishya repeats twice.  
Teaching pauses on anadhyayana but self study continues.


Paksha 1

- Lesson 5 instruction
- Lesson 4 10x self-study
- Lesson 3 5x self-study
- Lesson 2 3x self-study
- Lesson 1 1x self-study - expected to have memorized

Paksha 2

- Lesson 6 instruction
- Lesson 5 10x self-study
- Lesson 4 5x self-study
- Lesson 3 3x self-study
- Lesson 2 1x self-study - expected to have memorized

So the story is that all the eka-santa-grAhis would memorize on day 1. They would recite on day 2 and the dvi-santa-grAhis would memorize it. Etc.  
However, people generally rely on books for the "self study" part.

So, cumulatively 10x anUchchAraNa, 150 + 75 + 15 = 240x self-study.
