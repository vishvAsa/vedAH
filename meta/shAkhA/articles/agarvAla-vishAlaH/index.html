Tamil Nadu The Aiyar Brahmins of Tamil Nadu recite the Samhita, Padapatha, Kramapatha, Jatapatha and Ghanapatha of the Rigveda Samhita [STAAL 1961:24-25].
Kerala Nambudiris: According to the most comprehensive studies undertaken, approximately 35% of the Nambudiris are Rigvedins, 50% are Yajurvedins and just about 1/8% are Samavedins. The rest are excluded from Vedic study [STAAL 1961:35-36]. The peculiarities of Rigveda recitations of Nambudiris are discussed by STAAL [1961] in detail, and are beyond the scope of the present article. They do not recite the ghanapatha, and the Samhita, Pada and Krama recitions are collectively termed as Trisandham. Unique to this Brahmin community is the recitation of the vkrti called ‘rathapATha’, which is somewhat different from the standard ratha illustrated in the ‘aSTavikRti’ in printed additions such as those of Satavlekar [ibid 47].">

<p>Rigvedi Brahmin communities.</p>
<h3 id="tamil-nadu">Tamil Nadu</h3>
<p>The Aiyar Brahmins of Tamil Nadu recite the Samhita, Padapatha, Kramapatha, Jatapatha and Ghanapatha of the Rigveda Samhita [STAAL 1961:24-25].</p>
<h3 id="kerala">Kerala</h3>
<p>Nambudiris: According to the most comprehensive studies undertaken, approximately 35% of the Nambudiris are Rigvedins, 50% are Yajurvedins and just about 1/8% are Samavedins. The rest are excluded from Vedic study [STAAL 1961:35-36]. The peculiarities of Rigveda recitations of Nambudiris are discussed by STAAL [1961] in detail, and are beyond the scope of the present article. They do not recite the ghanapatha, and the Samhita, Pada and Krama recitions are collectively termed as Trisandham. Unique to this Brahmin community is the recitation of the vkrti called ‘rathapATha’, which is somewhat different from the standard ratha illustrated in the ‘aSTavikRti’ in printed additions such as those of Satavlekar [ibid 47].</p>
<p>The other significant feature of Nambudiri Rigvedins is that they recite not only the Samhita, but also their Brahmana, Aranyaka and the Upanishads with Vedic accents. Secondly. they are not necessary followers of the Asvalayana Sutra. They might also belong to the Shankhayana Sakha (which they call ‘Kausitaki’) [STAAL 1961:53].</p>
<p><strong>Maharashtra:</strong> Maharashtra has numerous communities of Brahmins following the Rigveda as their svashakha.</p>
<ol>
<li>Saraswat Brahmins [KARVE 1968:22] – Epigraphic records show that this community of Brahmins has been occupying the western coastal strip between Malwan (in Gujarat) to Managalore (in Karnataka) from at least the time of the Kadamba dynasty, i.e., the 12<sup>th</sup> century AD. Currently however, these Brahmins are found as far south as Cochin (in Kerala) and Mumbai and even in Chennai. The Saraswat Brahmins are known for their particular dietary trait – they eat fish, whereas all the Dravida Brahmins in their vicinity are vegetarians. They are the southernmost group of people speaking an Indo-Aryan dialect, and worship Lord Shiva as Mangesh, and the mother goddess in her various auspicious forms. The Saraswat Brahmins allow the marriage or a man with his mother’s brother’s daughter. They speak a language which is often distinguished from Marathi as a distinct language (and not a dialect of Marathi) by linguists. The Saraswat Brahmins are also called Gaud Saraswats or Shenvis. Per their own traditions, they hail from the banks of the Sarasvati River in north India, from where they were brought by Parshuram for settlement in and around Goa.</li>
<li>Karhade Brahmins [KARVE 1968:22-23] – They are a small community of coastal Maharashtrian, and live to the immediate north of the Saraswats, in the districts of Satara, Kolaba and Ratnagiri. The community apparently originated in the Deccan plateau, from where they migrated en masse towards the town of Karhad on the western edge of the plateau. Historical records indicate that they have been present in that area from at least the 12<sup>th</sup> century CE, and that they held important revenue offices from the 10<sup>th</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> century CE. The Karhade Brahmins are strict vegetarians, and they worship the mother goddess. They permit the marriage of a man to his sister’s daughter and to his father’s sister’s daughter. According to tradition, these Brahmins were created by Parshuram from a camel’s bone [ibid, 135].</li>
<li>Chitpavan Brahmins – They are also known as the Konkanastha Brahmins, are famous for a high incidence (approx. 10%) of occurrence of hazel eyes amongst its members. They are located traditionally north of the Karhade Brahmins, are associated very strongly with certain places in and around the Ratnagiri district north of Goa. Starting sometime around 1650 AD, large members started migrating to the Deccan Plateau, especially to Pune in the time of the Peshwa rule. They worship Lord Shiva in shrines along the coast and river beds on the coastal strip, in conjunction with a goddess [KARVE 1968:23-24]. They are strict vegetarians. Most Chitpavan Brahmins follow the Krishna Yajurveda, but some are Rigvedins as well. This is significant, as all other Maharashtrian Brahmin castes follow only one particular Veda.</li>
<li>Deshastha Brahmins: They are a numerous community on the central and western Deccan Plateau, and have been quite exceptional in the preservation of the Rigveda Samhita and its various recitation modes (Padapatha, Ghanapatha, Jatapatha etc.) along with the ancillary texts. They typically follow the Asvalayana Sutra, and till recently, memorized even texts such as the Nirukta, Panini’s Ashtadhyayi, Pingala’s Chhandasutras and so on. The Deshastha Brahmins are scattered all over the Deccan Plateau in Karnataka, Maharashtra, western Andhra Pradhesh along the banks of the Tapi, Godavari and Krishna rivers and are strict vegetarians. A large number of them worship the regional deities of Khandoba and Vithoba. They are strict vegetarians, and permit the marriage of a man to his sister’s daughter, and rarely, to his father’s sister’s daughter.</li>
<li>Devrukhe Brahmins: They are the smallest community of coastal Maharashtrian Brahmins, and derive their name from the place Devrukh in the Sangameshwar Taluka of the Ratnagiri district [KARVE 1968:134]. They are often looked down upon by other Brahmin communities and they permit the marriage of a man to his mother’s brother’s daughter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shakala Samhita</p>
<p>AMARNATHASHASTRI [1950] has examined several passages of Rigveda where there is a confusion between ‘spandra’ and ‘syandra’ and concludes that in RV 1.180.9; 5.52.3 and 5.52.8 – the traditional reading ‘spandra’ is more acceptable. On the other hand, the reading ‘syandra’ is preferable in RV 5.87.3; 6.12.5 and 10.42.8</p>
<p>Padapatha: The Padapatha surprisingly does not exist on 6 mantras -</p>
<p>**<em>Kramapatha of Rigveda:</em> **According to Mahabharata  Shantiparva 342.103-4, Galava, born in the Babhravya Gotra and a native of Panchala, composed the Krama text of Rigveda, together with a treatise in Shiksha. Rikpratisakya 11.65 too states that Galava was the first composer of the Krama text on Rigveda. The same text, a 11.33, quotes Babhravya, and the commentator Uvata designates him as Panchala. According to Kashika, the Sutra 2.4.5 of Ashtadhyai (adhyayanato’apiprakrishtakhyanam) refers to the Krama text of Samhitas as well. On the Kramapatha of the Rigveda, there exists a text called the Upalekha Sutra, which is variously attributed to Katyayana, Saunaka and Bharadvaja (see below for more details). Sankhayana Srautasutra 12.13.6 refers to ‘panchalapadavrttih’, which could indicate the Kramapatha. Recitors of the Kramapatha of Rigveda still exist.</p>
<p>Ghanapatha of Rigveda: Manuscripts of the same are reported to exist/have existed [Ref. 2, pg. 187] and the oral tradition is still alive in peninsular India.</p>
<p>Jatapatha: Short manuscripts containing the Jatapatha of a few selected verses of the Rigveda exist in certain manuscript collections [AITHAL 1991:188].</p>
<h3 id="oral-traditions">Oral Traditions</h3>
<p>Three types of Rigvedic recitation exist in India: Maharashtrian, Nambudiri and Tamil. The Maharashtrian Rigvedins belong to the Shakala Shakha and the Ashvalayana Sutra [Ref. 7, pg. 21].</p>
<h3 id="geographical-distribution">Geographical Distribution</h3>
<p>The epigraphy dealing with the northern Ashvalayanas is found to the east and the north: 1. At Barrackpur (West Bengal) during the Sena dynasty; 2. Around Jodhpur, Rajasthan, 8<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.; 3. In Mandhata, Malva (Madhya Pradesh), 12<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.; 4. In the Tirunelveli region, Tamilnad, 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.; 5. In the Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, 15<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.; 6. At Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, 17<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.; 7. At Tanjavur, Tamil Nadu, during Pallava rule; 8. In the North Arcot district, Tamil Nadu, 14<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E. [Ref. 7, pg. 22]</p>
<h3 id="traditional-commentaries-of-the-sakala-samhita">Traditional Commentaries of the Sakala Samhita</h3>
<h4 id="skandaswamin">Skandaswamin:</h4>
<p>The date of Skandaswamin can be deduced from the colophon verses in Hariswamin’s commentary on the Madhyandina Satpatha Brahmana. According to a verse in the colophons of the commentary, Hariswamin was the ‘dharmaadhyaksha’ of Emperor Vikramaditya, the ruler of Avanti. Hariswamin also states that he was the pupil of Skandaswamin, a commentator of the Veda. The date on which the commentary on the Satapatha Brahmana was written by Hariswamin is also mentioned in another verse, which is interpreted by SARUP [1937] as “This commentary was written when 3700 and another 40 years of the Kali Age had passed away” [p. 399]. Since the Kali Era commenced in 3102 BCE according to tradition, we arrive 638 CE as the year in which the commentary was composed. This leads to the difficulty that no king by the name Vikramaditya is known to have ruled at Avanti in that year. SARUP therefore amends the text to read ‘3600 and another 40 years’ leading to 538 CE as the date of the composition. Thereafter, he equates Yasodharman, the ruler of Malva, with Vikramaditya, and concludes that Yasodharman was the patron of Hariswamin. If we accept SARUP’s emendation, Skandaswamin becomes a senior contemporary of Hariswamin, and should have lived around the beginning of the sixth century C.E.</p>
<p>He was the son of Bhartrdhurva and belonged to Vallabhi in Saurashtra<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Apparently, he was a Vaishnava and followed the Sakala Sakha with the Asvalayanasutra<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Narayana</p>
<p>Udgitha: There is much similarity between the commentaries of Udgitha and Sayanacharya, and the latter borrows profusely from the former. However, Sayanacharya does not borrow from Udgitha blindly. Rather, when Udgitha gives multiple interpretations for words in Rigvedic verses, Sayana often accepts/borrows only one of them, which suits the ritual application of the verse. In addition, Sayana also stresses more on the etymological aspects of the verses. [KASHIKAR 1950]</p>
<p>Venkata Madhava</p>
<p>Madhvacharya (13<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.) the famous founder of the Dvaita Vedanta Sampradaya, composed a commentary on first 40 suktas of Rigveda from an Adhyatmic Vaishnava perspective. This commentary has a string of subcommentaries attached to it: The Bhashya of Jayatirtha (14<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.), Mantrarthamanjari of Raghavendra, Rigarthoddhara of Shrinivasa, Prakasha of Satyanatha, Vivritti of Pandurangi Keshavi Bhattaraka and Tippanis of Chalari Ramachandra Bhikshu and Arogya Hari.</p>
<h4 id="sayanacharya">Sayanacharya</h4>
<h4 id="ravana">Ravana</h4>
<p>Edward Hall was perhaps the first scholar to mention Ravana’s commentary on Rgveda<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. He stated that he had met several Pandits in Gwalior and Ajmer who were not only acquainted with Ravana’s commentary, but also claimed that it extended over the entire Samhitas of Rgveda and Yajurveda. HALL also noted that the existence of Ravana’s commentary on the Rgveda is indicated in Mallaari’s Grahalaaghava. Dayanand Sarasvati (d. 1883 CE), the founder of Arya Samaj, too mentions Ravana as a commentator of the Vedas, in his own Rgvedaadibhaashyabhumikaa. Bhagavad DATTA mentions the existence of a manuscript of Ravana’s Padapaatha on Rgveda Samhita in the Lalchand Library of D. A. V. University in Lahore before 1947. Nothing is known about its current existence.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The Padapaatha does differ from the prevelant Padapaatha of Sakalya on the Rgveda Samhita.</p>
<p>Citations from Ravana’s commentary are found in the Daivajna Pandit Surya’s commentary titled Paramaathaprabha on the Bhagavad Gita<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. These have been and edited with a Hindi translation by GUPTA [1967]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. The following table lists the commented mantras and their location in the commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.</p>

<p>On his Gita commentary on verse 11.33, Daivajna Pandit also notes that whereas Sayana’s commentary on the Vedas was primarily Adhidaivika (pertaining to deities and the rites associated with them), Ravana’s own commentary had a distinct <em>aadhyaatmika</em> (spiritual) bent. The summary below is based on this edition. Nothing much can be said about the date of Ravana, except that he must have obviously preceded Daivanja Pandit Surya, who himself wrote his commentary on the Lilavati in the year 1538.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Ravana seems to be a follower of Shankaracharya’s Advaita Vedanta. In his commentary, he quotes Rgveda, Yajurveda, Upanishads, Nirukta, Ashtadhyayi, Agama texts, Hathayoga texts etc. The editor compares and contrasts Ravana’s interpretations with those of these mantras in other Vedic texts (such as the Krsnayajurveda Samhitas and Brahmanas, Kalpasutras, Upanishads) and in later commentaries of Sayana, Skandasvamin etc. Whereas Madhavabhatta uses Brahmana texts quite profusely, Ravana does not seem to derive much from them [page 34]. While Venkatamadhava relies greatly on Pauranic and Akhyana interpretations of mantras, Ravana steers clear of this approach and draws more on Advaita Vedanta [page 38]. Sayana differes a lot from Ravana in interpreting Rgveda 10.129.1.2, but on other mantras, there are strong similarities. It appears that one of the writers is borrowing from the other, but on this basis alone, it is difficult to determine if Sayana preceded Ravana or vice-versa. In some cases (for instance on mantra 10.107.1), Ravana attributes a non-conventional meaning to Sanskrit roots (<em>dhatus</em>). Often, he also resolves the words of mantras in a manner different from that depicted in Sakalhya’s padapaatha.</p>

<p><strong>Sarvidyanidhana Kavindracharya Sarasvati</strong>: A fragment of the introductory portion of his Tika on Rgveda, comprising of a mere six folios, exists in the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta [HARAPRASAD SHASTRI 1923: 228]. The fragment does not even complete Kavindracharya’s introduction to his commentary. The brief passage from the same cited in the manuscript catalog seems to indicate that author considered Dharma as the supreme Purusharthas, even above Moksha.</p>
<p>Nitimanjari of Dyaa Dviveda: An autocommentary on the Nitimanjari too was composed by Dviveda and two manuscripts on the same exist in Calcutta [HARAPRASAD SHASTRI 1923: 249-251].</p>

<p>Peter Peterson published in 1888, a selection of Rigvedic hymns, together with their translation, from Bombay. The work was titled <em>Hymns from the Rigveda</em>.</p>
<p>Ralph T. H. Griffith produced a metrical popular translation of the Rigveda Samhita, which was first published in 1889 from Varanasi. The translation has been reprinted several times, in India and abroad, and is very widely used for several reasons. First, it is one of the few available complete translations in English of the text. Secondly, it is conveniently available in a single volume, whereas other translations, whether in English or in Indian vernaculars, are typically available in multi-volume editions. Griffith apparently took into account most of the material produced by western Vedicists on the text, till his time. However, despite the popularity of the translation, competent Vedicists today use the text with extreme caution, or even ignore it completely because of the presence of numerous inaccuracies and errors.</p>

<p><strong>Dayanada Saraswati</strong>: A massive commentary on Rgveda, extending to mantra 7.61.2<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> was written by the Swami, and the work was unfortunately interrupted by his sudden death<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. The commentary was first published in monthly installments, for several years after his death<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Eventually the Paropakarini Sabha of Ajmer consolidated these monthly fascicules into nine volumes and published them separately<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. The published editions of this work contain his Sanskrit commentary, and a Hindi translation by his collaborators Pandit Bhimasen and Pt. Jwaladatta [BHARATIYA 1974: 5sqq.]. The work has an extensive preface titled ‘Rgvedaadibhashyabhumika’ (‘An Introduction to the Commentary on Rgveda and other Vedas’) which contains lucidly written chapters on various topics related to Veda, and the Swamis views on various aspects of Vedic interpretation. Swamiji was very insistent that buyers of his commentary on Rgveda must also simultaneously buy this introduction<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. This Bhumika has chapters on forty topics such as revelation of the Vedas, scope of the term ‘Veda’, authoritativeness of various Hindus scriptures, cosmology, responses to certain anticipated objections, criticism of medieval commentaries such as those of Sayana and Mahidhara etc.</p>
<pre><code>Dayanand’s commentaries on Vedic texts conform to the beliefs regarding the Vedas propagated by the Arya Samaj, an organization that he started in the year 1875. First, the Vedas are held to preach pure monotheism and therefore Agni, Indra etc., are held to be merely names of the one God. Swamiji also rejected the notion that various devatas in the mantras were real entities, or that they were the ‘*abhimaani*’ souls of various cosmic bodies. Second, the Vedas are said to encompass the Samhitas only, not the Brahmanas. Third, the Vedas are said to be the eternal word of God revealed at the beginning of creation[^13], and as such, they are devoid completely of historical accounts or proper names. All apparently proper names (such as Divodasa) are there treated as adjectival nouns or as common nouns. Fourth, since the Vedas are divine knowledge, they contain all the branches of knowledge (even modern ones like telegraphy, aeronautics and so on) in the root form. Swamiji rejected a traditional view that the Samhitas dealt merely with Srauta ritual. Accordingly, his commentary endeavors to explain the mantras from a multifaceted ‘practical’ perspective, and tries to illuminate various aspects of sciences, politics, administration and arts through them. This does not mean that Swamiji rejected the ritualistic interpretations of the mantras per se. Rather, he said that Brahmanas, Kalpasutras and Mimamsasutras should be consulted for the same, and that there was no point in repeating them in his own commentary. Fifth, all the modern commentaries on the Vedas are held to be spurious. Only the works composed by sages from Brahma to Jaimini (including the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Sutras and so on) are held to reliable commentaries on the Vedas. Even these are to be rejected in so far as they are in conflict with the intent of the Samhitas. Sixth, even amongst the Samhitas, only the following 4 were revealed by God- Shakala (for Rgveda), Madhyandina (for Yajurveda), Shaunaka (for Atharvaveda) and Kauthuma (for Samaveda). All the other Samhitas are Sakhas that were composed by Sages and are like glosses on these four Samhitas. Seventh, the method of Yaska and Vyakarana are to be relied upon heavily to interpret the Vedas and the later Hindu texts like Puranas etc., must be rejected completely. 
</code></pre>
<p>Swaminji also authored a few other tracts and anthologies that incorporate his comments on the mantras of Rgveda. The text ‘Aryaabhivinaya’ gives an expanded devotional commentary on 100 mantras of the Rgveda and another 10 mantras from the Yajurveda (Madhyandina) Samhita<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Before commencing his commentaries on Rgveda and Yajurveda, Swami Dayanand compiled an index of topics of all the mantras in the four major Samhitas accepted by the Arya Samaj. This index is called ‘Chaturveda-Vishaya-Suchi’, and was published for the first time as recently as 1971 by the Paropakarini Sabha of Ajmer. This Index gives  the subject-matter or topic, according to Swamiji’s interpretation, for each varga of each adhyaaya or each ashtaka<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. The index extends over the other three Samhitas too, and the printed edition relies on a manuscript of this work, proof-read and corrected by Swamiji to the very end, that was deposited with the Sabha. Here and there, the topics listed for individual sections differ from those indicated by the Swami in his commentary proper, and the discrepancy is taken by Arya Samaj scholars as authoritative alternate interpretations of these sections.</p>
<p>The publication of his commentary on Rgveda was preceded by the publication of a ‘sample’ (Vedabhashya ka Namuna) which an extensive comment on the first few verses of the text. The publication of Swami Dayanand’s commentary on Rgveda generated a prolonged controversy, with contemporary scholars such as Pandit Maheshchandra Nyayaratna of Calcutta Sanskrit College and Raja Shivaprasad. The Swami wrote tracts such as Bhraantinivaarana and Anubhramochhedana to respond to his objectors.</p>
<p>A significant feature of the Bhashya is that in addition to mentioning the Devata, Rishi and Chhanda of each mantra per tradition, Swamiji also mentions the Svara or musical pitch in which the mantra ought to be recited. This additional information is derived from Pingala Chhandasutras.</p>
<p><strong>Pandit Aryamuni</strong>: As indicated above, Swami Dayanand Sarasvati passed away before completing his commentary on Rgveda. The Paropakarini Sabha deputed Aryamuni, a scholar of Arya Samaj, to complete this task. The Pandit could complete his commentary only on the remainder of Mandala VII, and on Mandala VIII and  IX. The work was published in six volumes from Varanasi between 1974-1980 Vikrami Samvat. The commentary gives the text of the mantra, the padapaatha, followed by a Sanskrit exposition of the various words in the verse, and finally the import. This is followed by word-meanings and translation in Hindi<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Pandit Tulsiram Swami</strong> (d. 1915): He was the principle disciple of Pandit Bhimasena Sharma. Tulsiram started completing the incomplete commentary of Swami Dayanand Sarasvati on Rgveda, publishing it in his monthly magazine ‘Veda-Prakash’ printed from Meerut. The first issue carrying this commentary appeared in the year 1910. This commentary is also in Sanskrit and Hindi, and could not be completed as well, because of the untimely death of the Pandit. His younger brother Pandit Chhuttanlal Swami started where his Tulsiram left, but could not reach the end of Rgveda as well<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Pandit Shivashankar Sharma Kavyatirtha</strong>: He is another scholar of the Arya Samaj, known for his massive commentaries on the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad and Chhandogya Upanishad. He too attempted to complete Swami Dayanand’s incomplete commentary on Rgveda Samhita, but the work extends only till Rgveda 8.29. It was published in Vikrami Samvat 1980<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Pandit Jaidev Sharma</strong> (1892-1961): He is the first scholar to have translated all the four Vedas into Hindi (or, as a matter of fact, into any Indian language). The translations were written between May 1925 and 1936, and comprise 7 volumes for Rgveda, 4 for Atharvaveda and 2 each for Yajurveda and Samaveda. Sharma closely follows the views of Swami Dayanand Sarasvati in his own translations. His translations have been reprinted numerous times and are prefaced by an elaborate and erudite note on the respective Veda.</p>

<p>Acharya Visvasrava Vyasa wrote a massive supercommentary titled ‘Anvitaarthapradiipa’ on Swami Dayanand Sarasvati’s commentary on Rgveda. This work has four sections. The first section, titled Padaarthapradiipa, comments on word-meanings in Swamiji’s work. The second section, titled Anvitaarthapradiipa explains the ‘anvaya’ (syntax of the verse) as understood by Swami Dayanand. The third section Bhaavaarthapradiipa comments on the import of the mantra as stated by Swamiji. The last section, titled Visvapradiipa, deals with the Rishi, Devata, Meter, Svara, Padapaatha etc., of the mantra<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.

<p>The purpose of these texts is to preserve the exact text of Rigveda, free from all corruptions by way of oral transmissions. There are literally 100’s of such texts, most of which are quite modern. Some are however ancient. A detailed discussion of these texts is beyond the scope of this work since it has already been done by Pt. Aithal (Ref. 2)</p>

<p>Jatapatala: The work is ascribed to Hayagriva and describes the vikritis of Rigvedic text.. The work has a commentary called ‘Dipika’ by Dayasankara, son of Dharanidhara Vyavaharuka. There are several other versions of the Jatapatala as well, including one alternately called the Vikrtivalli and attributed to Vyadi. This latter work has 19 verses and has a commentary on it by Anantacharya [AITHAL 1991:320-321]. Another version of Vyadi’s text has 11 verses, divided into two patalas of 6 and 5 verses respectively.

<h3 id="brahmin-communities">Brahmin Communities</h3>
<p>Nambudiris: According to the most comprehensive studies undertaken, approximately 35% of the Nambudiris are Rigvedins, 50% are Yajurvedins and just about 1/8% are Samavedins. The rest are excluded from Vedic study [STAAL 1961:35-36]. The peculiarities of Rigveda recitations of Nambudiris are discussed by STAAL [1961:40-54] in detail, and are beyond the scope of the present article. They do not recite the ghanapatha, and the Samhita, Pada and Krama recitions are collectively termed as Trisandham. Unique to this Brahmin community is the recitation of the vkrti called ‘rathapATha’, which is somewhat different from the standard ratha illustrated in the ‘aSTavikRti’ in printed additions such as those of Satavlekar [ibid 47].</p>
<p>The other significant feature of Nambudiri Rigvedins is that they recite not only the Samhita, but also their Brahmana, Aranyaka and the Upanishads with Vedic accents. Secondly. they are not necessary followers of the Asvalayana Sutra. They might also belong to the Shankhayana Sakha (which they call ‘Kausitaki’) [STAAL 1961:53].</p>
<p>The only printed edition of the Kausitaki Brahmin, based partly on oral recitations by a Nambudiri Brahmin, is however unaccented. The editor has not discussed any accent in the text as well.</p>
<p>Manuscripts of Shankhayana Rigveda: Max Mueller utilized 72 manuscripts to bring out his edition of the Rigveda. Unfortunately, these manuscripts, housed in Japan are said to have got destroyed during World War II. However, there is no paucity of Rigveda manuscripts (in addition to the very alive oral tradition of the text). The Wai Prajnapathasala (Satara, Maharashtra) alone possesses more than 200 manuscripts of the Samhitapatha alone, all belonging to the Sakala Rigveda.</p>
<p>The oldest manuscript reported for Rigveda dates to 1362 C.E. (Ref. 1, Preface) whereas the oldest manuscripts used by Max Mueller did not go beyond 17th Cent. C.E.. Not that it really matters, since the text has been preserved extraordinarily well without alteration of a single letter over several millenia orally.</p>
<p>Alberuni records a tradition that fearing the destruction of the Vedas, a native of Kashmir by the name ‘Vasukra’, committed all the four Vedas to writing for the first time&ndash;and just 50 years before Alberuni visited India.</p>
<p>Samkhayana Sakhas of Rigveda</p>
<p>Samhita manuscripts</p>
<ol>
<li>No. 120 (Ref. 1) in the Collection of the Royal Asiatic Society of Calcutta: This manuscript of Rigveda comprises of 12 different batches of leaves. The 12 batches are of different hand and cover different parts of the Rigveda. At least one scribe/owner is a Gujarati, leading us to presume that some of the batches might belong to the Samkhayana Sakha. This is also clear from the contents of the manuscripts. For instance, batch VIII, which comprises of Rigveda 7.1.1 - 7.2.23 (Ashtaka-Adhyaya-Varga), has 5 additional vargas after varga 18 as an integral portion of the Samhita. Vargas 19-21 are the Khila 17 of Max Mueller’s Rigveda edition while the vargas 22 and 23 are Khilas 19 and 20 respectively of Max Mueller’s edition. Then, in batch IX, which comprises of Rigveda 7.2.25-7.5.2, there are the same 3 vargas in the second Adhyaya compared to Mueller’s edition. In bundle VII, which comprises of Rigveda 7.6.24 to the end of the 8th Ashtaka, the text is the same as the Max Mueller’s edition till Rigveda Ashtaka 8, Adhyaya 2. At the end of the 3rd Adhyaya, there is added as Khila  the Khila 22 of Mueller’s 2nd edition. The 4th Adhyaya agrees with the vulgate till varga 25, after which the manuscript breaks off. The text then commences from the end of the 28th varga of the 8th Adhyaya, which does not agree with the 28th Varga of the 8th Adhyaya of the vulgate. The text is considerably different after the 28th varga of Adhyaya 8 (the last Adhyaya of the Samhita). The Sakala has 49 vargas in the last Adhyaya but this manuscript has 64. The distribution of vargas 29 onwards is as below:</li>
</ol>
<p>Varga 29: Starts with ‘Gobhirjushtee dhanena..” not found in Mueller’s or Satavalekara’s editiom</p>
<p>Varga 30 is Sukta 167 of varga 25 of vulgate</p>
<p>Varga 31 is Sukta 168 of varga 26</p>
<p>Varga 32 is Sukta 169 of varga 27</p>
<p>Varga 33 is Sukta 170 of varga 28</p>
<p>Varga 34 is Sukta 171 of varga 29</p>
<p>Varga 35 is Sukta 172 of varga 30</p>
<p>Varga 36 is Sukta 173 of varga 31</p>
<p>Varga 37 is Sukta 174 of varga 32</p>
<p>Varga 38 is Sukta 175 of varga 33</p>
<p>Varga 39 is Sukta 176 of varga 34</p>
<p>Varga 40 is Sukta 177 of varga 35</p>
<p>Varga 41 is Sukta 178 of varga 36</p>
<p>Varga 42 is Sukta 179 of varga 27</p>
<p>Varga 43 is Suktas 180 and 181 of vargas 38 and 39 respectively of vulgate</p>
<p>Varga 44 is Sukta 182 of varga 40</p>
<p>Varga 45 is Sukta 183 of varga 41</p>
<p>Varga 46 is Sukta 184 of varga 42</p>
<p>Varga 47 is Khila 34 of Satavaleka’s Rigveda (Khila 30 of Mueller’s Rigveda)</p>
<p>Varga 48 is Sukta 185 of varga 43</p>
<p>Varga 49 is Sukta 186 of varga 44</p>
<p>Varga 50 is Sukta 187 of varga 45</p>
<p>Varga 51 is Sukta 188 of varga 46</p>
<p>Varga 52 is Sukta 189 of varga 47</p>
<p>Varga 53 is Sukta 190 of varga 48</p>
<p>Varga 54 is Sukta 191 of varga 49</p>
<p>The manuscript has 10 more vargas, none of which occurs in the Vulgate (Sakala) Rigveda</p>
<p>Varga 55 is Khila 32 of Max Mueller’s edition</p>
<p>Varga 56 is verses 5-7 of Khila 36 of Satavaleka’s edition (or 5.2 in the Kashmir Khila samhita)</p>
<p>Varga 57 is verses 1-4 (?) of Khila 5.3 of Kashmir Khila Samhita</p>
<p>Varga 58 is verses 5-7 (?) of Khila 5.3 of Kashmir Khila Samhita</p>
<p>Varga 59 is verses 1-5 (?) of Khila 5.4 of Kashmir Khila Samhita</p>
<p>Varga 60 is verses 6-8 (?) of Khila 5.4 of Kashmir Khila Samhita</p>
<p>Varga 61 is verses 9-11 (?) of Khila 5.4 of Kashmir Khila Samhita</p>
<p>At this point, the manuscript ends and the colophon states : “Hereby ends the 64th Adhyaya.” signifying the end of the Samhita.</p>
<ol>
<li>No. 140 (Ref. 1) in the Collection of the Royal Asiatic Society of Calcutta: This composite manuscript consists of 15 batches of leaves belonging to different ages. Batch no. 12 comprises of complete Ashtaka 6 (Mandala 8, Sukta 12 to Mandala 9, Sukta 43). The author of the catalog states- “The MS. is unique, in that it seems to belong to a recension of Rgveda, different from that published by Max Mueller. For instance, in VI.4 (Ashtaka 6, Adhyaya 4), there is one sukta more in Max Mueller’s edition than in the present MS.” We might note that Ashtaka 6, Adhaya 4 corresponds to Mandala 8, Suktas 46 to 67 of the Vulgate. This section includes the Valkhilya mantras as Suktas 49 to 59 of the Vulgate Rigveda Samhita. The extant manuscripts of the Asvalayana and the Samkhayana samhitas are not very different from the Vulgate (Sakala) Sakha and so we can safely surmise that it belongs to the Baskala Sakha. In fact, the description of the Baskala Rigveda Samhita in Satavalekara’s edition (Ref. 2, Pg. 72 of the Prastava/Introduction) clearly shows that this portion of the Baskala Samhita was totally different from the vulgate in the arrangement of Mantras.</li>
<li>Manuscript of Samkhayana Praisha Adhyaya at Calcutta (Ref. 1, Pg. 240, entry no. 171): According to the catalog, the text comprises of 72 mantras of which 68 start with the words ‘hota yaksata&hellip;’. Hence, this Praishadhyaya is quite different from that of the Kashmir Khila Samhita.</li>
<li>Manuscript at the British Museum, London (Ref. 2, Pg. 1-2): The manuscript was hand-copied by the Brahmanas of Jaipur in the 2nd half of the 18th Cent. C.E. for Lieut. Pollier, a employee of the East India Company from 1759-1789, with the authorization of Maharaja Pratap Singh. The manuscript colophons specifically do not state that it belongs to the Samkhayana Sakha of the Rigveda, but the description given in the catalog confirms the same. The catalog states that the arrangement and number of hymns in the 8th Ashtaka is different from the edition of Max Mueller. Specifically, the following features are noticed:</li>

<p>a. In the 8th Ashtaka, the numbering of the Vargas differs considerably from that of the Vulgate owing to insertion of several Khilas as an integral part of the text. Khila 22 of the Max Mueller’s edition (‘Avidhva&hellip;’) forms 29th Varga of the 3rd Adhyaya</p>
<p>b. Khilas 25 (1-13 verses only) and 27 of Max Mueller’s edition are included in their normal place as an integral part of the Samhita text. Due to these additions, the number of vargas has become 56 instead of 49 in the vulgate.</p>
<p>c. The 56th Varga comprises of the last Sukta of the Vulgate plus the mantra ‘Tachhanyora Vrinimahey&hellip;” which is said to be the last verse of the Baskhala Sakha.</p>
<p>d. Vargas 57-60 are comprised of the first 14 verses of the Samjnana Sukta (since the last or the 15<sup>th</sup> verse was included in the previous Varga)</p>
<p>e. The Samhita ends with 3 Vargas of the Mahanamni group. Thus, the 8th Adhyaya of the 8th Ashtaka has 63 vargas in all.</p>
<p>Sarvanukramani</p>
<p>A manuscript of the Sarvanukramani of the Sankhayana Sakha might exist at Alwar [AITHAL 1991:220].</p>
<p>Sankhayana Pratisakhya: A manuscript of the Pratisakhya of the Sankhayana Samhita of Rigveda is listed in the Alwar collection [AITHAL 1991:197]. Varadattasuta Anarttiya, the commentator of Shankhayana Srautasutra, quotes a Pratisakhya a few times in his commentary (e.g. under Sutra 10.6.26) and these references can be traced back to the vulgate Rk-Pratisakya.  This indicates that the Sankhayana Pratisakhya might have been very similar to the vulgate version, if not identical to it.</p>

<h3 id="kausitaki-aranyaka">Kausitaki Aranyaka</h3>
<p>This text is still unpublished.</p>
<p><strong>Kausitaki Brahmana Upanishad</strong>:</p>
<p>The Kausitaki Upanishad comprises of four chapters and is an integral part of the Shankhayana or the Kausitaki Aranyaka. The text has long been highly esteemed in the Vedantic tradition, and citations from it occur in the works of Shankaracharya. The very first publishers of the text and its commentaries realized from the manuscripts that the Upanishad exists in two distinct recensions or Sakhas<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. Apparently, Shankaracharya presupposed a text that was slightly different from the one followed in his dipika by Shankarananda. The differences in the two recensions are seldom more than verbal, and occur largely in the last two chapters. Shankarananda’s dipika suffices to explain the text of both the versions. It appears that these minor textual differences stem from the fact that the Aranyaka, of which the Upanishad is a part, itself exists in two or perhaps more different recensions.</p>
<p>In the vulgate text given in all the printed editions of the Shankhayana Aranyaka, the Upanishad</p>
<p>In some manuscripts, the Upanishad apparently constitutes books I-IV of the Aranyaka. In others, it forms books VI-IX, or books III-VI. Some scholars such as Poley even suggest that the Upanishad forms books I, VII, VIII and IX of the Aranyaka<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Most manuscripts designate the text not as Kausitaki Upanishad, but as Kausitaki-Brahmana-Upanishad. The extant Shankhayana/Kausitaki Brahmanas have 30 chapters, and literature mentions a ‘Mahakausitaki Brahmana’ as well. So it has been conjectured that the Upanishad and portions of the Aranyaka formed part of a larger Kausitaki Brahmana which may not have survived today.</p>

<h2 id="bashkala-sakhas-of-rigveda">Bashkala Sakhas of Rigveda</h2>
<p>Communities of Bashkala Rigvedins: The Bashkala Rigveda was in vogue in some parts of Assam [B. R. SHARMA 1996: 67].</p>
<p>Samhita: In his commentary on Saunakiya Charanavyuha, Mahidasa makes a very significant comment&ndash;”The Rigveda comprises of Sakala and Baskala” and then goes on the name the five groups of Sakhas of the Rigveda. The import of this statement can be understood if we realize that the arrangement of the Baskala Samhitas of the Rigveda was significantly different from that of the Samhitas of the 4 other groups.</p>
<p>Anukramani:</p>
<p>Manuscripts of the Anukramani of the Baskala Rigveda Samhita by Jagannatha exists in the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal (Manuscript # 234 and 235 ; Reference 1; Pg.278-281). It is unclear from the catalog if the manuscripts contains the original Anukramani or just a ‘Vivarana’ by Jagannatha. The latter possibility appears to be true. A large fragment of the manuscript is quoted and what strikes one immediately from it is that the author of the original Anukramani was Sage Parasara, the Son  of Sage Sakti (and the father of Sage Vedavyasa). Also, Sage Parasara’s Anukramani was at considerable variance from that of Sage Saunaka on the Sakala Samhita of Rigveda. According to the Anukramanika Vivarana of Jagannatha, the Baskala Sakha had 1028 Suktas and 10552 mantras of the chatushpada mantras were counted as dvipadas and if the Valkhilya mantras (numbering 80) were included. But, if the dvipadas were counted as chatushpada, then the number dropped to 10482 mantras. Further, if the Valkhilyas were also excluded, there were 10404 mantras in the Samhita. In addition, the colophon at the end of one of the manuscripts also adds that the Samhita had 2006 Vargas (exclusive of Valkhilya mantras) and another 18 Vargas of the Valkhiya mantras. The colophons do not clarify the provenance of the manuscripts, which are written in Nagara characters</p>
<p>In his monumental anthology, AITHAL [1991:316] has mentions that the same work is listed under different titles like Anuvakanukramani-vivarana, Rgveda-Anukramani-Vivarana, Anukramanika-Vivarana, Sukta-Pratika and Rgveda-Sukta-pratikanukramanika-sara. It is significant that several of these manuscripts are found in Kerala, where some Nambudiris still adhere to the Bashkala Sakha Samhita.</p>
<p>It might be pointed out however, that one manuscript gives the number of Suktas as 1027, which might be explained by the fact that it is incomplete (Ref. 1, Pg. 282, no. 238)</p>
<p>Kalpasutras:</p>
<p>It is uncertain if the Bashkala Rigvedins had an extensive Kalpasutra of their own. There are sufficient indications that they often used the texts of other Rigvedic Sakhas. For instance, the Rigvedins of Kerala claim to follow the Bashkala Sakha and yet follow the Kausitaki Brahmana and the Samkhayana Sutras. Likewise, a mauscript of the Anvadhanakarma of Sakala Rigveda Samhita (Ref. 1, Pg. 407) quotes the ‘Bashkalasamhitayam Samkhyayana Sutram.’</p>
<p>Gargya Narayana states that the Ashvalayana Shrautasutra deals with the Sakala and the Bashkala Samhitas of RV, together with the Aitareya Brahmana, the Valakhilya Hymns, the Nivids, Praishas, Kuntapa hymns, Mahanamni verses and the Purorucs.</p>

<p>Manuscripts: A manuscript of the Asvalayana Brahmana together with the Samhita) is mentioned in Kavindracarya’s list</p>
<p>In the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal at Calcutta (SHASTRI 1923:256, entry no. 199), a manuscript of the 5th book of the Aitreya Brahmana according the Asvalayana Sakha. The text is identical to the vulgate (attached to the Sakala Samhita). The manuscript is copied at ‘Rampur’, which cannot be identified.</p>
<p>The Ashvalayana Shrautasutra refers to the views of ‘Aitareyins’ two times, which makes it appear that the sutra does not belong exclusively to that recension of the Rigveda to which the Aitareya Brahmana is attached, or it may mean that the sutra belongs to a recension different from the one to which this Brahmana text is attached. Sutra 1.3.12 reads [RANADE 1981:8] – “Between the two (main) havis-offerings the followers of the Aitareya recension utter the expression ‘visnum (avaha)’ in a low voice (both in the Purnamasa and Darsa isti).” At sutras 3.6.3 and 10.1.13, the Aitareya school is quoted again.</p>
<h3 id="asvalayana-srauta-sutra">Asvalayana Srauta Sutra</h3>
<p>Devasvamin, the oldest commentator of the Asvalayana Srautrasutra, states that Saunaka authored the Srautasutra whereas Asvalayana was the author of the Grhyasutra. Gargya Narayana states that the ASS deals with the Sakala and the Bashkala Samhitas of RV, together with the Aitareya Brahmana, the Valakhilya Hymns, the Nivids, Praishas, Kuntapa hymns, Mahanamni verses and the Purorucs.</p>
<p>The only English translation of the text is by RANADE [1981, 1986]. A partial German translation by Klaus Mylius also exists.</p>
<p>The teachers and schools cited by this Shrautasutra are as follows –</p>

<p>This text has numerous commentaries [JOG 1974]</p>
<ol>
<li>Agnisharman: An author of this name is quoted by Jayantasvamin in his Vimalodayamala on the Sutra (see below). The nature his work is unkown.</li>
<li>Vrttikara: The views of a Vrttikara on the Asvalayana Grhya Sutras are often quoted and contrasted with those of others (like Jayanatasvamin) by the Kumarila Karikas (see below) and Narayana (see below). The identity of this author is unknown, but he seems to have lived in great antiquity.</li>
<li>The Grhya Karikas of Bhatta Kumarila: It is uncertain if the author is the same as the famous Mimamsaka. At least 2 manuscripts of this work state that the authors are Yellamabhatta and Mallari.</li>
<li>Ramabhatta, also called Buppadevasishya, has composed a voluminous commentary on the Karikas of Kumarila. He has quoted Jayantasvaim, Devasvamin, and an anonymous Vrttikara</li>
<li>Karikas of Sakalya, Saunaka and Raghunatha: These are metrical works ascribed to these authors. If genuine, the first two would be extremely ancient.</li>
<li>Asvalayana Grhyaprayoga Dipika: Attributed to Maharshi Shaunaka</li>
<li>The Vimalodayamala of Jayantasvamin: This is a ‘prayoga’ text, published by JOG [1974]. It completes the lacuna in the ritual of Asvalayanas by borrowing the relevant passages from the ritual texts of other Shakhas, and presents the entire ritual of the school in a systematic manner by bringing together all the relevant sutras together wherever necessary. Jayantasvamin apparent wrote any versified work on the Sutra, which was called the Jayanta Karika. Commentaries exist on these Karikas as well. Jog points out however that these Karikas are the work of someone else, possibly Yellamabhatta or Mallari [op. cit., p. xvi] and the title Jayanta Karika is probably a scribal error. Jog also proposes that Jayantasvamin might have been the son of Harisvamin, who lived in Central India in the 7<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> Cent. C.E. Jayantasvamin quotes a wide array of Vedic texts – RV, AV, Brahmanas, VYV and so on.</li>
<li>Bhashya of Devasvamin: He is considered a commentator par-excellence in the Asvalayana tradition. There is a considerable controversy about his age. According to Kane, he lived around 1000-1050 C.E., whereas according to Hillebrandt and Kashikar, he might have lived as early as 500 C.E. [op. cit., pg. xii]</li>
<li>Vrtti of Narayana, of Naidhruva gotra: Manuscripts containing the entire work exist at Calcutta [HARAPRASAD SHASTRI 1923: 330-331].</li>
<li>Bhashya of Haradatta: The commentary is concise and very useful. According to Kane, he lived towards the close of the 12<sup>th</sup> Cent. C.E.</li>

<h3 id="brahmin-communities-1">Brahmin Communities</h3>
<p>The Madhyandina Sukla-Yajurveda Sakha is the predominant Sakha of any of the four Vedas, across the length and breadth of northern India. Communities are, or were found till a century back, in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and also in Sindh and in Nepal. The Sukla Yajurveda as such is not as popular as the Krsna Yajurveda south of the Vindhya mountains, and most Sukla Yajurvedins in peninsular India adhere to the Kanva Sakha of Sukla Yajurveda. The Madhyandinas are found today, however, as far as south as Mysore city [STAAL 1961:19].</p>
<p><strong>Haryana:</strong> In Kanvagram, near Kurukshetra in Haryana, and in some places in the Himachal Pradesh and Panjab, the Sarasvata Brahmins who followed the Kanva Yajurveda Sakha originally, now study the Madhyandina recension because of the non-availability of their own recension [B. R. SHARMA 1996: 67-68].</p>
<p><strong>Rajasthan:</strong> Of the 12 Gotras of the Dahima Brahmins of Rajasthan, the following adhere to Sukla-Yajurveda’s Madhyandina Sakha, together with the Katyayana Sutra – Gautama, Bharadvaja, Bhargava, Atreya, Parasara, Kapila, Garga [ASOPA 1988:23-29]. These Yajurvedin Brahmins worship Lord Shiva and tie their top knot of hair on the right side of their heads.</p>
<p><strong>Maharashtra:</strong> The Maharashtrian Madhyandina Brahmins along the banks of Godavari, in northern eastern and eastern Maharashtra and a little beyond up to the Krishna river, are the southernmost community of Brahmins following the Madhyandina Shakha of Sukla Yajurveda. They are strict vegetarians, and have a strong presence in and around Nashik. Unlike many other castes of Maharashtrian Brahmins, they avoid all sagotra marriages on the mother’s side, and also do not permit any kin-marriages. According to KARVE [1968:25], this indicates that the community had migrated from somewhere further north in India, and not necessarily from Gujarat [op. cit., 137]. The Madhyandina Brahmins in eastern Maharashtra often worship devi Renuka of Mahurgad. They are considered a section of the Maharashtrian Deshastha Brahmins. They often act as priests to the Sudras, a practice that is traditionally shunned by other Maharashtrian Brahmins castes.</p>
<h3 id="samhita">Samhita</h3>
<p>Also called Vajasaneyi Samhita, it comprises of 40 chapters of unequal length. It is a widespread belief amongst north Indian Vaidiks that the Madhyandina Samhita represents the original Vajasneyi Samhita. For instance. Mimamsaka points out [ref. 5; pg, 10-11] that in a manuscript of an anonymous work titled “Madhyandina Shakhavishaya” that is preserved at Chennai, it is mentioned that the Madhyandina Shakha is the chief recension among the 15 recensions of Sukla Yajurveda. In the Holaribhashya on the Sarvanukrama sutras of Katyayana on the Shukla Yajurveda too it is stated that the Madhyandina Samhita represents the Ur-text of Shukla Yajurveda. Commenting on Sutra 1.3 of the Pratijnasutra-Parishishta, Anantadeva also quotes Vasishtha to the effect that the Madhyandina Samhita is ‘Sarvasadharani’ i.e., it is of a general nature and applicable to all the schools of Shukla Yajurveda. To demonstrate the Ur nature of the Madhyandina Samhita, the followers of Arya Samaj typically adduce an additional proof based on the internal testimony of the Yajurveda Samhita. They point out that Madhyandina Samhita 9.14 reads “Esha vo’ami raja” wherein the word ‘ami’ is a general pronoun that can be substituted with the name of any ruler. In contrast, in place of the pronoun ‘ami’, the Kanva Samhita 11.1 specifically mentions the rulers of Kuru-Panchala, Taittiriya Samhita 1.8.90 mentions Bharata, where Kathaka Samhita 15.7 and Maitrayani Samhita 2.6.94 mention the people as the ruler. This is taken as an indication of the fact that while the other Samhitas substituted the word ‘ami’ with specific names depending on their provenance, the Madhyandina Samhita preserved the original text.</p>
<p>The first edition of the Madhyandina Samhita was published by Albrecht Weber in the year 1852 from London/Berlin.</p>
<h3 id="padapatha">Padapatha</h3>
<p>Mimamsaka [1971] has published an authoritative edition of the Madhyandina Samhita Padapatha after collating manuscripts from various parts of India. The edition has a very useful general essay on the characteristics of the Padapatha of various Vedic Samhitas prefixed to it.</p>
<p>The author of the Padapatha of the Madhyandina Samhita is not known definitely, although the colophons of some manuscripts name him as Sakalya, to whom the famous Padapatha of Rigveda Samhita is also attributed [Mimamsaka 1971:2]. One manuscript at Calcutta even mentions Saunaka as its author [p. 29]</p>
<p>Curiously, tradition is not so uniform with regard to this text, and four variations of the text, differing in a few minor details, are seen in the manuscripts. The technical details of the four versions are difficult to explain in this essay, but nevertheless I will list some general information regarding these [p.42 - 51]:</p>
<p>Version 1: This represents the text followed by the followers of the Madhyandina Sakha in North India. Numerous manuscripts found in Varanasi and elsewhere in India conform to this version.</p>
<p>Version 2: It is identical to the first version, except that for a few differences in the accentuation (and accent symbols) assigned to the resolved words. The edition of the Padapatha published from Varanasi (by Gaurish Yantralaya) could be considered a representative of this version.</p>
<p>Version 3 and 4 largely follow version 1 but differ from the same and amongst each other in minor respects. Version 3 is represented by the edition of the Samhita and Padapatha published from Mumbai (by the ‘Tattvavivechaka Press’). Mimamsaka suspects that the fourth version might represent a subdivision of the Madhyandinas [p. 49]</p>
<h3 id="kramapatha">Kramapatha</h3>
<p>The Samhita text forms the basis of the Pada text. The Pada text forms the basis of the Krama text while the Krama text forms the basis of all the remaining Vikriti texts. The Krama of Yajurveda was published on the basis of a solitary manuscript provided by Pt. Madan Mohan Vyasa to Pt. Mimamsaka (ref. 5; pg. 16). Unfortunately, the published volume covers only chaps. 1-20 of the Samhita and so far I have not yet seen the Krama of the remaining chapters. Mimamsaka points out that the Krama of the Samhita is of 2 or more varieties owing to the fact that the Padapatha on which it is based itself is of several types. The manuscript of the first 20 chapters was copied in Shaka 1792 whereas that of chapters 21-40 was copied in Shaka 1724.</p>
<p>The kramapatha of the entire text has also been written by Pandit Virasen Vedashrami of Gurukul Kangri, and it still lies in manuscript<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="other-vikriti-pathas-of-madhyandina-samhita">Other Vikriti Pathas of Madhyandina Samhita</h3>
<p>The Samhita text forms the basis of the Pada text. The Pada text forms the basis of the Krama text while the Krama text forms the basis of all the remaining Vikriti texts. Kramapatha manuscripts are found all over India [AITHAL 1991:524-525]. Pandit Virasena Vedashrami has written down various Vikrti Pathas (Jata, Ghana etc.) for chapters 31-40 of the Samhita, but this work is still in manuscript<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="oral-traditions-and-geographical-distribution">Oral Traditions and Geographical Distribution</h3>
<p>According to information provided by V. Raghavan and W. Howard, Madhyandinas are found at Varanasi, Ambala, Jallandhar, Indore, Ujjain, Nagpur, Nashik, Jammu. Historically, they have remained confined to Northern India. In fact, the Madhyandinas are often said to have the maximum number of followers of any Vedic school alive, and can recite not only the Samhita, Pada and Ghana pathas but also the other vikritis [Ref. 7. pg. 119]. Accentuation of the Madhyandina recension of the Vajasneyi Samhita is in no way connected with the accentuation of the text [Ref. 4, pg. 163].</p>

<p>Mantra Bhasya of Uvata: According to the colophons of this work, Uvata hailed from Anandapura in Gujarat, but wrote his commentary while living in Avanti during the reign of Raja Bhoja (996-1051 C.E.). According to some, Uvata and Kaiyata were brothers of the Kashmirian scholar Mammata, and were therefore Kashmiri Pandits. However, this view is untenable because the colophons clearly state that he was the son of Vajrata, who was from Gujarat [ref. 2, pg. 21]. At the commencement of his commentary, Uvata lists the exegetical principles (<em>vyakhya dharmas</em>) that he will employ. The commentary is brief and precise.</p>

<p>Bhashya of Maharshi Dayanand Sarasvati: A massive commentary on the Samhita was commenced by the Swami in Vikrami Samvat 1934, and was completed in five years<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Like his commentary on Rgveda Samhita, the Sanskrit text is directly authored by the Swami, and the Hindi translation is done by two collaborators Pandit Bhimasena Sharma and Pandit Jwaladutta Sharma. The commentary was published in four volumes by the Vaidik Yantraalaya of Ajmer. The translation is not in a very polished language, and is often at variance with the Sanskrit text. Therefore, the Arsha Sahitya Prachar Trust retranslated the Sanskrit portion into Hindi and republished the entire work in four attractive volumes. Another notable edition of this work was published by Ramalal Kapoor Trust (Sonepat, Haryana). This edition extends only to the first 15 adhyaayas of the Samhita, and contains a very extensive annotation or super-commentary by Pandit Brahmadatta Jijnasu. An attempt has been made in the Sonepat edition to justify grammatical objections raised against Swamiji’s commentary by other Sanskrit scholars. For the first two chapters, the Jijnasu has also attempted to explain each mantra in a three-fold manner (adhidaivika, aadhyaatima and adhibhautika).</p>

<p>Devichand (1880-1965) translated Dayanand Sarasvati’s commentary of Yajurveda into English. The translation does not include Swami Dayanand’s word-meanings, extensive comments on mantras or their import and is basically a bare-bones translation of the Samhita based on the Swami’s massive commentary. This translation is widely available in numerous printed editions today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pandit Jaidev Sharma (1892-1961): He is the first scholar to have translated all the four Vedas into Hindi (or, as a matter of fact, into any Indian language). The translations were written between May 1925 and 1936, and comprise 7 volumes for Rgveda, 4 for Atharvaveda and 2 each for Yajurveda and Samaveda. Sharma closely follows the views of Swami Dayanand Sarasvati in his own translations. His translations have been reprinted numerous times<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> and are prefaced by an elaborate and erudite note on the respective Veda.</p>

<p>The rituals in the Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmana occur in the same order as the Samhita with the slight difference that the Pinda-pitr-yajna appears after Darshapurnamasa in the Samhita but after the adhana in the Brahmana. The Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmana is divided into 14 Kandas containing 100 adhyayas, 68 prapathakas, 436 Brahmanas and 7179 Kandikas</p>
<h4 id="commentaries-on-satapatha-brahmana">Commentaries on Satapatha Brahmana</h4>

<p>Harisvamin: He is the oldest commentator of the text. According to a verse in the colophons of the commentary, Hariswamin was the ‘dharmaadhyaksha’ of Emperor Vikramaditya, the ruler of Avanti. The date on which the commentary was completed is also mentioned in another colophon verse, which is interpreted by SARUP [1937] as “This commentary was written when 3700 and another 40 years of the Kali Age had passed away” [p. 399]. Since the Kali Era commenced in 3102 BCE according to tradition, we arrive 638 CE as the year in which the commentary was composed. This leads to the difficulty that no king by the name Vikramaditya is known to have ruled at Avanti in that year. SARUP therefore amends the text to read ‘3600 and another 40 years’ leading to 538 CE as the date of the composition. Thereafter, he equates Yasodharman, the ruler of Malva, with Vikramaditya, and concludes that Yasodharman was the patron of Hariswamin.</p>

<li>Bhartyajna’s Bhashya: He is said [ref.3, pg. 97] to have** **been a ‘Nagara Brahmin’ and is mentioned in Skanda Purana (Naagara Khanda 113-117). According to these 4 chapters, he belonged to the Samkrtya Gotra and was the son of Nimi. His other name was Prabhavadatta. He was believed to have supernatural powers and earned the name ‘Bhartryajna’. He was the leader of the Nagara Brahmins and re-established 64 families of Nagara Brahmins in Chamatkarapura (modern Vadanagara) [ref. 2, pg. 85]. From the list of his works also, he appears to have been a Shukla Yajurvediya Brahmana of Madhyanandina Shakha (which is prevelant in Gujarat, the home of Naagara brahmins). Since he is quoted in the ‘Trikandamandana’ and Karka’s commentary on the same text, he has to be prior to 1150 A.D. Bhartryajna is mentioned by Medhatithi (9th Cent. C.E.) in his commentary on the Manusmrti [ref. 3, pg. 309]. An incomplete manuscript of this commentary, covering only the first chapter of the Srauta Sutra exists in Baroda.</li>

<p>Pratijnasutra Parisishta – this is the third of the 18 appendices attributed to Katyayana, and is a supplement to the Vajasneyi Pratisakhya. The text is divided into three Kandikas – Svara Prakriya, Uccharana-vidhi and Anusvara-visarga-svara-vikara, containing 10, 8 and 5 sutras respectively. However, the division of the sutras and their number in each kandika varies in different manuscripts.

<li><strong>Katyayana Siksa</strong> [AITHAL 1991:259-260] – This text is different from the famous Yajnavalkya Siksa. It comprises of 13 verses dealing with the accentuation of the detached words (pada-s) and also of the words in the Samhita text. Most of the rules in this text are a metrical exposition of those mentioned in the Vajasneyi Pratisakhya. The text along with its commentary by Jayanta Swami are published in the ‘Siksa Samgraha’ collection from Varanasi [Benares Sanskrit Series, vol. 10, 1889]. Another version of the Katyayana Siksha comprising of 11 verses also exists in manuscript [AITHAL 1991:261].</li>
<li><strong>Bhashika Sutras:</strong> A work by Sage Katyayana dealing with the accentuation of Brahmana texts, and the Satapatha Brahmana in particular. It has a commentary on it by Anantacharya, also called Anantadeva Bhatta who followed Kanva Yajurveda and lived at Varanasi around 1626 C.E. He was the son of Bhagirathi and Nagadeva [AITHAL 1991:73, 463-466]. Another commentary by Mahasvamin also exists. The critical text, with both the commentaries have been published by CHAUBEY [1975]. The Bhashika sutra extends over 3 kandikas, comprising 22, 22, 29 sutras respectively according this edition.</li>
<li><strong>ParibhashAnka Sutra</strong> [AITHAL 1991:411] – A short text of 9 sutras attributed to Sage Madhyandina. Sometimes accompanied by a commentary and a summary in 6 verses, both of whom are authored by Kesavarama Daivayajna. The Sutras together with the commentary and the 6 summary verses constitute the ‘Kesavi Siksa’.</li>
<li><strong>Parasari Siksa</strong> [AITHAL 1991:428-429] – It is a text of 160 verses giving the number of letters in each Kandika of the Sukla Yajurveda, and also discusses the method of their pronounciation. It also gives some euphonic rules, but not in any well defined order. The text has been published in the ‘Siksa-Samgraha’ collection of Varanasi.</li>
<li>**Mandavya Siksa – **It enumerates the ‘b’ letter occurring in each chapter of the Sukla-Yajurveda Samhita. Published in the ‘Siksa-Samgraha’ from Varanasi.</li>
<li><strong>Yajnavalkya Siksa:</strong> Also known as Vajasneyi Siksa, the work is almost a running commentary on the Sukla-Yajupratisakhya of Katyayana. Numerous printed editions of the text area available, and it has been published with a Hindi translation cum commentary by Vidyadhara PANDEYA [1978] from Varanasi. Uvata and Mahidhara have written commentaries on this text.</li>
<li><strong>Vasishthi Siksa:</strong> There are several texts belonging to the Vajasneyi Samhita bearing this name. The most common version differentiates between verses (Rks) and prose sentences (Yajus proper) from each other in each chapter of the Samhita. The total verses are said to be 1467 while there are 2833 Yajus, bringing the total to 4300. Due to this reason, the colophons name the text as ‘Rgyajusor vibhaga’. The Siksa follows the Katyayaniya Vajasneyi Pratisakhya very closely. The text is included in the ‘Siksa Samgraha’ collection published from Varanasi.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Haryana: In Kanvagram, near Kurukshetra in Haryana, and in some places in the Himachal Pradesh and Panjab, the Sarasvata Brahmins who followed the Kanva Yajurveda Sakha originally, now study the Madhyandina recension because of the non-availability of their own recension [B. R. SHARMA 1996: 67-68].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maharashtra: Kanva Yajurvedin Brahmins are a section of Deshastha Brahmins in Maharashtra, found mostly at Pandharpur (where they preside as priests of the Vithoba temple) and further south. They are the southernmost branch of Sukla Yajurvedin Brahmins [KARVE 1968:136].</p>

<p>Tamil Nadu: A few villages in and around the towns of Trichinopoly and Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu [STAAL 1961:19]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Samhita:</strong> Exists in two versions&ndash;the well known Vulgate, and the slightly different Orissan version.</p>
<p><strong>Padapatha:</strong> Manuscripts are extant. The Padapatha of the first 20 chapters is published in Sharma’s edition [ref. 1] on the basis of 3 manuscripts. To my knowledge, the Padapatha of the remaining 20 chapters is yet unpublished even though manuscripts of the entire Padapatha are also extant at various places..</p>
<p><strong>Kramapatha</strong>: Manuscripts are extant [e.g., HARAPRASAD SHASTRI  1923: 681] though it is unclear if the oral tradition still survives.</p>
<p>Jatapatha: A manuscript of the jatapatha extending up to the 17<sup>th</sup> chapter exists [AITHAL 1991:253, 257].</p>
<p>Oral Traditions and Geographical Distribution:</p>
<p>Epigraphic and literary evidence [Ref. 4, pg. 119-120] attests to the presence of Kanvas over large parts of South Asia: Nepal, Vishakhapatnam (Coastal Andhra Pradesh), Orissa, on the Godavari River, Bangladesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Nagpur and even at Jaipur and Varanasi (of course)</p>
<p>Accentuation of the Madhyandina recension of the Vajasneyi Samhita is in no way connected with the accentuation of the text. It need not be inferred that Kanva White Yajurveda and Saunaka Atharvaveda (both of which are recited with accent) are earlier than the Madhyandina Yajurveda, for adherents of these two schools seem to model their recitals after Rigveda recitation in the Maharashtrian style [Ref. 4, pg. 163].</p>
<p>Therefore Kanva Yajurveda is closely allied with Maharashtrian Rigveda and hence also with the Atharvaveda from the same general region. From the facts before us, we are prone to assume that an independent Kanva style does not exist and that an independent Kanva style does not exist and that at least as far as music is concerned, propagators of the Shakha are little more than Rgvedis in disguise. The texts of the White Yajurveda support the contention that the Kanvas are under greater Rigveda influence. Renou has noticed that where the two Shakhas: Madhyandina and Kanva, disagree, the disagreement is not always an innovation on the part on the part of one school of the other, but rather an attempt to approximate a reading of another Samhita. The Kanva recension ordinarily imitates the Rgveda or the Taittiriya branch of the Black Yajurveda, whereas the Madhyandina Shakha approaches the Maitrayani and Kathaka Samhitas of the Black Yajus [Ref. 4, pg. 198].</p>
<p>Lakshana Texts on the Samhita:</p>
<p>AITHAL [1991] lists numerous Lakshana texts on the Kanva Sakha but I will restrict myself to a description of only those texts that are either ancient, or those that are attributed to ancient authorities (e.g. Katyayana).</p>
<ol>
<li>Laghu Pratisakhya – This work is attributed to Katyayana and exists in manuscript [AITHAL 1991:253].</li>
</ol>
<p>Indices of Kanva Samhita</p>

<li>Sarvanukramani or the Kanvanukramani – Exists in manuscript [AITHAL 1991:257]. Its relationship with the Madhyandina Sarvanukramani of Katyayana is unclear.</li>

<h3 id="kanva-shatpatha-brahman">Kanva Shatpatha Brahman</h3>
<p>The first seven Kandas of the Kanva version of the Vajasneya Brahmana was published by Wilhelm Caland. However, because of inadequate manuscript material, he had to resort to the better preserved text of the Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmana and had to amend the text at several places. Caland printed only the first seven Kandas because it is here that the text of the two versions differs considerably. For the remaining portions, he was content with listing the main differences.</p>
<p>Starting recently, a critical edition of the Kanva text is being printed anew by C. R. Swaminathan [1994-]. So far, 3 volumes comprising 5 kandas of the text, with a lucid English translation have appeared. Swaminathan made use of a Telugu edition that was based on oral tradition. In addition, he was able to make use of additional manuscripts that were prepared by a Kanva scholar who could recite the text with accent from memory. As is well know, oral traditions of Vedic texts are typically purer than the written manuscripts. Finally, whereas Caland used transcripts of manuscripts preserved in Indian libraries for his edition, Swaminathan was able to access the actual manuscripts themselves, thereby circumventing any scribal errors that might have crept into the transcripts. The translation by Swaminathan is indebted to Eggeling’s English translation of the Madhyandina Shatapatha, a fact acknowledged by the former in the introduction of his edition. It appears, that the manuscript of the entire Kanva Shatapatha Brahmana was complete when the first volume was published, and it is hoped that the entire text too  would be printed soon.</p>
<p>In the Kanva sakha, the Samhita commences with the Darshapurnamasa rite but the Brahmana deals with the adhana at the beginning. Consequently, the order of the first and the second kandas in the Kanva is inverse of that in the Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmana. The text as such is divided into 17 Kandas, 104 adhyayas, 435 Brahmanas and 6806 Kandikas. Note that unlike the Madhyandina version, there is no division into Prapathakas.</p>

<p>The division of the text into Kandikas is more rational in the Kanva version, and the division into Adhyayas less erratic.</p>
<p>Swaminathan [1994:xviii] has suggested that only the first 9 Kandas of the Madhyandina Shatapatha (= first 11 Kandas of Kanva Shatapatha) were transmitted orally with great fidelity because the rituals contained in the remaining portion of the texts were not performed with great frequency.</p>
<h4 id="commentaries-3">Commentaries</h4>
<ol>
<li>Sayanacharya’s Commentary: Traditionally, it extends only upto the first 20 chapters of the text. Like his other commmentaries on Vedic texts, this one too is encyclopedic, and very well planned and systematic. Sayana quotes the Katyayana Srauta Sutras and the relevant portions of the Shatapatha Brahman as he comments on the mantras of the Samhita. He goes beyond the texts of the Kanva Shakha and quotes the Apastamba and Baudhayana texts as well as the Taittiriya Samhita/ Brahmana/ Aranyaka to impart more clarity to the ritual formula being explained. A drawback of Sayana&rsquo;s commentary, although it demonstrates his sound knowledge of Vedic accentuation, prosody etc., is that he restricts himself only to the ritualistic meaning of the mantra as established by tradition, even when the natural meaning of the mantra is not ritualistic. A few years ago, ‘Sayana’s’ commentary on the last 20 chapters of the Kanva Samhita was also published [ref. 3]. The commentary was published on the basis of a solitary palm-leaf manuscript in the Oriya script preserved in the collection established by ancestors of  Pandit Mahesvaracharya  in the village named ‘Athagarha’ in the district of Ganjam in Orissa.</li>
<li>Anandabodha: He was a native of Andhra Pradesh, and his commentary shows the influence of the Orissan version of the Kanva Samhita. Anandabodha begins the commentary of each verse by listing the Devata, meter and the Seer. He does not restrict himself to the ritualistic meaning of the mantras like Sayana, but tries to extract the deeper, spiritual meanings wherever possible. At times, he even hints at the . His commentary, called the Bhasyasangraha, extends over all the 40 chapters of the Samhita. Apparently, the author was also called Anandabhatta Chaturvedin.</li>
<li>Anantacharya: His commentary covers only the final 20 chapters of the Samhita.</li>

<p>The Sukla Yajurvedin Deshastha Brahmins have an endogamous subcaste named Jabala, who were presumably the followers of the Jabala Sakha of this Veda [KARVE 1968:136].</p>
<p>A manuscript of the Rudraprakasha or Rudrapaddhati or Rudrakailasa attributed to Bhaskara Diksita (son of Ramakrshna Diksitam and disciple of Achala Diksita) exists in Calcutta. A folio of the same indicates that the text and the accents of the Rudradhyaya of the Jabala recension are identical to the Kanva and Madhyandina versions [HARAPRASAD SHASTRI 1923: 649]. The author evidently had access to the Jabala texts because he cites them in his work.</p>

The text consists of Sanatkumara’s questions addressed to Bhagavana Katyayana on the origin of Rudraksa, method of wearing Rudraksha beads accompanied by recitation of mantras, and the criteria of determining who can wear them and who cannot wear them. The extent of the text is 50 shlokas. The colophons of the manuscript indicate that the text belongs to the Katyayana Sakha, and the manuscript is written by an Aghori Saivite monk.</p>

<p>Nambudiris: According to the most comprehensive studies undertaken, approximately 35% of the Nambudiris are Rigvedins, 50% are Yajurvedins and just about 1/8% are Samavedins. The rest are excluded from Vedic study [STAAL 1961:35-36]. All Nambudiri Yajurvedins are Taittiriyas. About 90% of them follow the Baudhayana Kalpa, while the remainder follow the Vadhula sutras.</p>

<p>Some manuscripts of Charanavyuha give the names of the five divisions of  Kandikeya section of Taittiriya Recension as: Kaleyas (Kaletas), Satyayanins, Hiranyakesins, Bharadvajins and Apastambins. Other manuscripts of Charanavyuha state clearly that all the 5 branches of the Khandikeya school viz. Apastambi, Baudhayani, Satyashadha, Hirnayakesi and Aukheyi, possess the same Amnaya comprising of 7 Kandas, 44 Prasnas, 65 Anuvakas, 19290 Padas and 253868 syllables.</p>
<p>Colophons of some manuscripts of the Taittiriya Samhita and Taittiriya Brahman call the text as Apastamba Samhita and Apastamba Brahman respectively, but it merely denotes that these manuscripts belonged to Taittiriya Brahmins who belonged to the Apastamba Charana.</p>

<p>Manuscripts of Kashmiri Vedic literature always spell Apastamba as ‘Apastambha’. Several Hiranyakesin Brahmins regard their school as a sub-school of Apastambins (Buhler, xxiv).</p>
<p>The Taittiriya Samhita of the Nambudiris: Significantly, as noted by STAAL [1961:56-57], the Taittiriya text recited by Nambudiris has a slightly different internal arrangement than the printed versions, as well as from the arrangement discussed by the Baudhayana Grhyasutra and the Kandanukramani. The Nambudiris recite the Samhita, along with the ‘shaakhaa’ – which includes the Brahmana, Aranyaka and the Upanishad. STAAL [page. 57] also points out that the designation ‘shaakhaa’ seems quote old, and has been referred to by the European missionary De Nobili before 1615 C.E.</p>
<p>The Samhita of the Namudiris is divided into 7 kaandas, each of which is subdivided into more than 1 prapaaThakas. Within each kanda, the prapaaThakas are numbered starting with 1. There are 44 prapaaThakas overall, and they are also numbered continuously from 1 to 44 over the entire text – except that the prapaaThakas, when numbered thus, are called ‘prashnas’. The correspondence between prashnas and prapaaThakas is as follows-</p>
<p>Kanda I.1-8 =  prashnas 1-8</p>
<p>Kanda II.1-6 =  prashnas 9-14</p>
<p>Kanda III.1-5 = prashnas 15-19</p>
<p>Kanda IV.1-7 = prashnas 20-26</p>
<p>Kanda V.1-7 = prashnas 27-33</p>
<p>Kanda VI.1-6 = prashnas 34-39</p>
<p>Kanda VII.1-5 = prashnas 40-44</p>
<p>The shaakhaa portion of the recited text consists of 39 prashnas, most of which are called by specific names by the Nambudiris. The table below is adapated from STAAL [p. 56] and gives the correspondence between the Nambudiri shaakhaa text, the printed versions of TB/TA/TU, the division as indicated by the Kandanukramani of the Atreyi shaakhaa, and the divisions as indicated in the Baudhayana Grhyasutra.</p>

<p>STAAL [page 37] further notes –</p>
<p>“The relation between sakha 34 and 25 is uncertain (TA 4.1-42 is the mantra section of the Pravargya, the position of which is floating). The mantras of the Pitrmedha are placed inbetweenTB 3.4 and 5, in the same order as Atreyi (Kieth assigned to the Pitrmedha a loose place in the tradition) The Narayana Up is placed before the TU. It should be noted, that nowhere does the Namudiri sakha follow the order as given by Baudhayana whilst differing from the order of Atreyi and/or of the present day edition.”</p>
<h4 id="taittiriya-brahmana">Taittiriya Brahmana</h4>
<p>The Brahmana comprises of 3 kandas, which are divided into 8, 8 and 12 adhyayas respectively. The Brahmana is also sometimes divided into 8 ashtakas, in the style of Rigveda. These adhyayas are further divided into anuvakas or sections, which contain sentences on a particular topic. There are a total of 17480 sentences in the Brahmana. The first kanda of the text deals with the Agnyadhana, Gavamayana, Vajapeya, Soma, Nakshatreshti and Rajasuya. The 2<sup>nd</sup> kanda deals with Agnihotra, Upahomas, Sautramani, Vaisysava and others. The last kanda gives some additional details on the Nakshatreshti, the Ashvamedha and some parables like that of Bharadvaja, together with the Purushamedha Yajna.</p>
<p>The first edition of the text was published in 3 volumes by Rajendralal Mitra in the years 1855-1870 from Calcutta.</p>

<p>**Kalanirnaya Siksa [**AITHAL 1991:262-264] – This treatise of 27 verses deals with the time measurement of letters, accents and stops. The work is quoted in the Tribhashya ratna commentary on Taittiriya Pratisakhya 18.1, in the commentary on Vyasa Siksa of SuryanarayanavadhAnin and in the commentary on the Siddhanta Siksa. It has a commentary named Dipika, authored by Muktisvara or Muktisvaracharya. Both the Siksa and the commentary are still unpublished although manuscripts are listed in several catalogues.</p>
<p><strong>Kaundinya Siksa</strong> [AITHAL 1991:269-270] – This text exists in two versions. The first consists of 100 verses and was first published by ABHYANKAR and DEVASTHALI [1978] from a solitary manuscript discovered in a private collection at Hyderabad. The second version comprises of 86 verses and deals with various topics related to the Taittiriya Samhita. In the colophons, the latter text is also called ‘Sarva-sammata-siksa’ or ‘Kaundinya Siksa Sadasiti’ and still exists in manuscript form alone.</p>
<p><strong>Sambhu Siksa</strong>: This is a work of about 50 verses and explains the names of the various kandas and anuvakas of the Taittiriya Samhita. It classifies the letters of the alphabet and deals with accent, quantity, hiatus, doubling of consonants etc. It is evidently an old text, being quoted the Tribhashya Ratna on  Taittiriya Pratisakhya 1.1, 21.15 and in Vaidikabharana on Taittiriya Pratisakhya I.40 [AITHAL 1991:572].

<li>Vivarana of Padmanabha Yajvan – still in manuscript</li>
<li>Chhandobhasa or Pada-krama-sadana of Mahisheya – Published from Madras on the basis of a manuscript obtained from Kerala.</li>
<li>Sabda-Brahma-Vilasa of Viraraghava [AITHAL 1991:565]. This is a commentary on the Taittiriya Pratisakhya explaining the apparent contradictions between the Tribhashya-ratna and the Vaidikabharana. The work states that the Pratisakhya was authored by Lord Hanuman, and that the older commentators on the work were Atreya, Mahiseya and Vararuchi.</li>
</ol>
<p>**Aranya Siksa: **This text, as the name suggests, deals with the accentuation of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. It professes to be based on 9 other Siksa texts and therefore calls itself ‘Aranya-Siksamrta’. Some manuscripts of the text also give its name as ‘Aruna Siksa’ or the ‘Aruna’ [ref. 3, pg. 131]</p>

<p>The text does not have the general characteristics of a Siksa text. Rather, its aim seems to be to keep the Taittiriya Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka and the Ekagnikanda free of improper readings. However, the text obviously does not deal with all the words occurring in the Taittiriya Veda. It lays down rules to distinguish between and to employ in their proper places words of similar sound or form. For instance, it indicates where to read ‘Vrjana’ and where ‘Vrijina’ and so on. It follows the traditional order of the Taittiriya texts while treating the words occurring therein. It is not possible to date the text or its commentary by Nagesvara, the son of Vrddhagiri.</p>

<p>**Baudhayana Grhya Sutras **(Ref. 2)</p>
<p>The esteem of the Gryha sutra of Baudhayana (spelt as Bodhayana in South Indian manuscripts) is so great that it is counted as the first amongst the 18 principal grhya sutras. These 18 are enumerated by Agnivesya Grhya sutras as: Bodhayana, Apastamba, Satyashadha, Drahyayana, Agastya, Sandilya, Asvalayana, Sambhava, Katyayana &ndash;these are 9 ‘purvasutras.’ Vaikahanasa, Saunakiya, Bharadvaja, Agvivesya, Jaiminiya, Vadhula, Madhyandina, Kaundinya and Kausitaki&ndash;these are 9 ‘aparasutras’.</p>
<p>The Baudhayana Grhyasutra comprises of 5 portions which together form 14 prasnas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grhya in 4 prasnas</p>

<h3 id="provenance-of-taittiriya-apastamba-charana">Provenance of Taittiriya Apastamba Charana</h3>
<p>According to the verses of Maharnava quoted by Mahidasa in his commentary on Shaunakiya Charanavyuha sutras, the Yajurveda of Tittiri and the Apastambiya school are established in the Andhra country and other parts of the south and the south east up to the mouth of Godavari river. Thus, the river marks the northern frontier of the territory occupied by the adherents of the Apastamba charana of Taittiriya shakha.</p>
<p>This holds true even today and the Apastambin Brahmins of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra can accurately recite the Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka of the Taittirya Shakha accurately from memory. Scholars of this shakha are so proficient in their learning that they can recite the texts from beginning to end, the reverse direction, or from any particular word onwards if that particular word in the text is pointed out to them. Approximately 98% of Vedic Brahmins of Andhra Pradesh belong to the Yajurveda and they are predominantly Apastambins. A saying in the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh goes- “Even a domestic cat can recite the Taittiriya Shakha.” The Taittiriya Apastambins found in Varanasi and other parts of India are originally immigrants from the traditional homeland of adherents of this shakha.</p>

<p>Bharadvaja Paribhasha Sutra</p>
<h3 id="hiranyakesin-sakha">Hiranyakesin Sakha</h3>
<p>According to Jaidev Sharma [Samvat 2019:25], a ‘Hiranyakeshin Mantrasamhita’ comprising of a small collection of ritualistic mantras, is still extant.</p>
<p>####### Hiranyakesin Kalpa</p>
<p>The Hiranyakesin Kalpa is a full fledged Kalpasutra: Srautasutra comprises Prasnas 1-18 and 21-24, Grhyasutra comprises Prasnas 19-20, Sulbasutra is Prasna 25, Dharmasutra is Prasnas 26-27 and the Pitrmedhasutras are Prasnas 28-29</p>
<p>There has been considerable discussion on the correct name of the text: Satyasadha or Hiranyakesin. NAVATHE [1990] has shown that the correct name of the Sutrakara is ‘Satyasadha’ while ‘Hiranyakesin’ is his distinctive epithet, indicative of the fact that he had light or reddish hair. Hence, Satyasadha Sutra and Hiranyakesin sutra are not two different texts and the name ‘Hiranyakesin’ became more popular because of the exclusiveness of the epithet.</p>
<h4 id="hiranyakesin-srauta-sutra">Hiranyakesin Srauta Sutra</h4>
<p>The entire text has been published in 10 volumes by the Anandasrama-Samskrta Granthavali by Pt. Kasinatha Sastri Agashe et al from 1907-1932 with various commentaries as follows:</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Commentary of Mahadeva on Prasnas 1-6, 11-18 and 21-29. This work is called Prayoga Vaijayanti.</li>
<li>Commentary of Matrdatta on Prasnas 19-20</li>
<li>Commentary of Gopinatha Bhatta on Prasna 7-10. This commentary is called Jyotsna.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other commentaries that exist on the text are</p>
<ol>
<li>Ujjvalaa by Mahaadeva Diksita</li>
<li>Prayogaratna by Mahadeva Somayaajin</li>
<li>Commentary by Vanchesvara, composed around 1800 CE.<sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup>
Each Prasna is divided into Patalas, which in turn comprise several Khandas. The sutras in individual khandas are not numbered in this edition, which needs considerable improvement. A critical edition of Prasnas 1-6 was prepared by V. V. Bhide by collation of numerous manuscripts. The work could not be completed beyond the sixth Prasna because of the untimely death of Bhide, but has been carried forward by Navathe who is preparing a critical edition of the entire text.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this critical edition, Navathe is utilizing manuscripts from regions further south of Maharashtra. The existence of such manuscripts also dispels the notion that the Hiranyakesins were confined to Maharashtra. A close comparison with the Apastamba and the Bharadvaja Srautasutra is also being carried out for a better reconstruction of the text.</p>
<p>In his Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS from Gujarat, vol. I, p. 38, Buhler mentions a ‘Hiranyakesisakhiya Brahmana’. WEBER [1878: 92, fn. 95] opines that if at all this is a different work, it would not deviate much from the Apastamba Sakha version of Taittiriya Brahmana since the Kalpasutras of the two Sakhas are so similar.</p>

<h2 id="charaka-shakha-of-krsna-yajurveda">Charaka Shakha of Krsna Yajurveda</h2>
<p>Area of Prevelance: Charaka Brahmins are found in the Aurangabad-Nagpur region of Maharashtra. However, when their own texts got lost, they adopted the Maitrayaniya texts a few centuries ago. The Charaka Brahmins thus recited the Maitrayaniya Samhita till recent times, and followed mainly the Varaha Sutra. Some follow the Manava Sutra as well. Manuscript searches in this region have not yielded any manuscripts of the Charka Samhita as of yet and some scholars opine that the Charaka Samhita was the same as the Kathaka Samhita. Such a view is however, refuted by the Charaka Brahmins, who are adamant that theirs was a separate, full-fledged shakha of the Yajurveda [ref. 1, introd.].</p>
<p>The Charaka Brahmins settled in Nashik have also adopted the Maitrayani Samhita, and have lost their own original Sakha [B. R. SHARMA 1996: 68]. They are the smallest community of Brahmins in Maharashtra. In 1960’s, they numbered a mere 4000 strong [KARVE 1968:155, fn.7]. They profess to have followed the the Charak shakha of Krishna Yajurveda, and are concentrated in and around Aurangabad and Nagpur, from whence many members migrated to Nashik a few centuries ago. They permit matrilineal cross-cousin marriages.</p>
<p>Charaka Samhita:</p>
<p>It is unclear if the Charaka Samhita has yet been found, as Sharma’s cryptic statement reads as follows: “I could not trace a single MS of Caraka Samhita, not even in parts or fragments, in the possession of any when I undertook a survey of this region (=Nagpur- Aurangabad region) in 1977 in search of Vedic manuscripts. In Nasik however, we were able to get two collections of MSS preserved in old families which were acquired by the Vaidika Samsodhana Mandala, PUNE. These collections contained some rare and precious MSS including those of the Maitrayaniya Samhita” [ref. 1, introd.]. In the same work however, Sharma lists Charaka Samhita as one of the texts of Yajurveda that are extant. Elsewhere too, Sharma states that the Charaka Samhita is extant [ref. 2. pg.  ] although he does not give any description of the text.</p>

<h3 id="area-of-prevelance">Area of Prevelance</h3>
<p>The Maitrayaniya Samhita is currently prevalent in interior Maharashtra in areas around Nagpur, and in the regions around Nashik, particularly in Bhadgaon. Followers of this shakha invariably followed the Manava Sutra at Bhadgaon, while elsewhere they followed either the Manava Sutra or the Varaha Sutra. The Charaka Brahmins of Nagpur-Aurangabad region adopted the Maitrayaniya Samhita after their own Samhita was lost [ref. 2]. Famous Maitrayaniyas include Sabara [Chinnaswami Shastri 1937] and Bhartrhari.</p>
<h3 id="historical-perspectives">Historical Perspectives</h3>
<p>Discussing the history of the Manava Maitrayani school, Kashikar [1990] states that :</p>
<p>Pg. 105: As the epigraphical records indicate, grants were made to the Maitrayaniya Pandits by Royal families in different regions like Sambalpur (Orissa), Saurashtra, Surparaka etc. One cannot say whether these grants were made to the Pandits by special invitations or whether there were colonies of the Maitrayaniyas in those regions. The manuscripts which were procured for preparing the editions of the Matrayani Samhita and the Manava Srauta and Grhya Sutras belonged to the region known as Baglan. This means that in historical times Maitrayaniyas lived only in this region. In Patanjali’s time, the Kalapakas or Maitrayaniyas lived in Punjab in large numbers. There is no trace of this recension now in that region. Nor do we come across any Maitrayaniya settlement in the region known from epigraphical records. From the fact that the royal family of the Baguls brought with them the Maitrayaniya families from Kanauj to Baglan, it becomes evident that the Maitrayaniyas were originaklly included among the five Gauda sects.</p>
<p>Pg. 106: A verse from the Sahyadrikhanda of the Skandapurana supports this fact. After being settled in Baglan they were enumerated among the five Dravida sects. Ultimately the Maitrayaniyas were confined only to this region. The districts of Gujarat and northern Maharashtra preserved the Maitrayaniya tradition. The credit of preserving on the surface of the earth the tradition and religious practices of the Maitrayaniyas thus goes to the rulers who colonized the Vaidiks in Baglan and patronized them and also to the Vaidiks who came down and maintained the tradition….</p>
<p>The generations of Maitrayaniyas living in Baglan were divided into two branches by reason of the different spoken languages namely, Gujarati and Marathi. Naturally their Maitrayaniya traditions developed along rather different lines. Already during their migration to Baglan which might have taken a long time, the Maitrayaniyas might have suffered from heavy odds resulting in the damage to their religious traditions. During migration and also in Baglan their tradition of domestic rites might have been already preserved. On the other hand, the tradition of sacrificial rituals was declining from the Sutra period itself, hence there is no wonder that the Srautrasutra text had begum to suffer from an insecure tradition. Since the ritual tradition was on a decline, the preservation of Srautrasutra text in a written form must also have suffered. It seems the tradition in northern Maharashtra suffered more than in Gujarat. All the manuscripts, which exist, are copied in fractions. Such a practice might have been responsible for the loose and defective sequence of the Sutra text.</p>
<p>The damage done to the Matrayaniya recension as a whole is quite obvious. The Maitrayani Samhita itselr suffered from insecure tradition. There must have been a Pada text for the Samhita which is now totally lost. A mantra-Samhita serially collecting only the mantra-portions out of the mixed Mantra-Brahmana portions was formulated probably for avoiding the strain on memory of the Vedic students. One is at a loss to know the age of that compilation. In recent times, even a Padapatha was the newly devised for priestly purpose. While the Padapatha in the Gujarat tradition was based in the mantra-portions only, that in the Maharashtra tradition was based on the Samhita-text as it is irrespective of whether it was mantra or brahmana.</p>
<p>Pg. 107 In selecting only the mantra portions for the Padapatha, the Gujarat tradition followed the Sukla Yajurveda tradition in which the mantras form an independent collection. The Maharashtra tradition followed the Krsna Yajurveda Taittiriya tradition in which the Samhita consisting of both the mantras and the brahmana is provided with a Padapatha. Both the Padapathas are defective; the Gujarat Padapatha may be said to be less defective.</p>
<p>Baglan= Gujarat + Northern Maharashtra</p>
<h3 id="samhita-and-padapatha">Samhita and Padapatha</h3>
<p>The Vaidik Samsodhana Mandala has collected numerous manuscripts of the Maitrayani Samhita and its Padapatha from Nashik, Bhadgaon (a village close to Nashik), Nandurbar and Wai (in Satara District). These manuscripts are being collated for a fresh critical edition of the text. The Samhita has a peculiar system of accentuation wherein the Udatta is marked with a vertical line above the syllable, and the various Svaritas are shown with additional distinctive marks. Strangely however, the Padapatha manuscripts do not follow this distinct accentuation, and seem to rather follow the widespread systems stemming from the Rigveda and Taittiriya Yajurveda traditions. Dharmadhikari therefore terms the accent in Maitrayani Pada manuscripts as ‘artificial’ although he admits their utility in determining the accent of the Samhita text and in splitting of the Pada to some extent.

<p>Friedrich Knauer published a portion of the text in 5 parts from St. Petersburg (Russia) in 1901-1903. J. M. van Gelder published the sixth part comprising the Agnichayana in 1921. Subsequently, Gelder completed the work and published the entire text along with an English translation, plus a few Parisistas from Delhi in 1961.</p>
<p>This edition of Gelder was reprinted from Delhi by Shri Sat Guru Publications, appended with a list of suggested corrections and emendations by C. G. Kashikar.</p>
<p>Kashikar has collected 11 fresh manuscripts from Baroda, Nashik and Wai and is preparing a fresh critical edition. Upon examining the fresh manuscript material, KASHIKAR [1990] has suggested the following departures from Gelder’s edition:</p>
<p>First, Gelder divides her text into 11 parts which are further divided into Adhyayas or chapters. Kashikar states that the 10<sup>th</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup> parts are actually Parisistas falling within the realm of Manava Grhyasutras, hence they need to be detached from the Srautrasutra.</p>
<p>Second, part 8 of Gelder’s edition comprising the ‘anugrahika’ is not an integral part of the Manavasrauta Sutra, but rather a Parisista of the Srautasutra.</p>
<p>Third, Kashikar has concluded that the Srauta tradition of the Manavas diverged at some point of time into two streams- the Gujarat tradition which is older, and the Maharashtra tradition (in districts adjacent to Gujarat) which is younger. He proposes the following sequence of the various portions of the Srautasutra</p>

<p>Kashikar has also suggested that the earlier view that Apastamba was indebted to Manava is flawed and a closer examination of the texts rather suggests the reverse.</p>
<h3 id="manava-grhyasutra">Manava Grhyasutra</h3>
<p>The text, with extracts from the commentary was first published by Friedrich Knauer from St. Petersburg in 1897, and the complete text of the commentary with the sutra was eventually published by Ramakrishna Shastri in the Gaekwad’s Oriental Series.</p>
<p>The text is known by three names – Manavagrhyasutra, Maitrayaniya Manava Grhyasutra  and Maitrayaniya Grhyasutra. The preface to this edition was written by B. C. Lele. According to Lele [SHASTRI 1926: 6], these three names are respectively in the order of their increasing antiquity. The commentary states that the author of the sutra is Manavacharya and it is unclear of its author was ‘Manava’ or if it belonged to the school of Manavas. The sutra also cites a few verses by pritka, which do not occur in the Maitrayani Samhita.</p>
<p>The text, as it exists today, seems to be composite with several later accretions. Lele notes [p. 7] –</p>
<p>“&hellip;the opening sections which give the vratacharyaa and sandhyaa as well as the next four sections appear to be later. The Simantonnayana ceremony is mentioned twice at 1.12.2 and 1.15. At the end of the First Purusha we find several Diksas mentioned which do not appear to be directly connected with Grhya ritual. In the second Purusa we find the Prashthikalpa (11.13), a rite consisting of shtaalipaaka offerings not mentioned in the other Grhya Sutras. Section 11.14 contains the interesting worship of the Vinayakas. They are represented as demons which have a malicious influence on the life and wsork of men&hellip;.”</p>
<p>On the relative dates of the sutra – it is often held that the Manavagrhyasutra is older than those of the Taittiriya Krshnayajurveda. Lele [SHASTRI p. 9] also proposes that the extant text, usually titled Manavagrahyasutra, supplanted an older Maitrayaniya Grhyasutra.</p>
<p>The Manavagrhyasutra runs parallel to the Kathakagrhyasutra. The two texts have several entire chapters in common (e.g., vratacharyaa, vaisvadeva etc.) and agree in the choice of expression and mantras. It has been proposed by Jolly that the Kathaka and Maitrayaniya schools arose in adjacent geographical regions, which is why their texts are so similar to each other.</p>
<p>No personal details are known about Ashtavakra, and even his name is deduced as such from an introductory verse occurring at the commencement of his commentary on the second Purusha. The commentator cites Mansmriti, Vasistha Dhamasutra and several other texts without mentioning the source of his citations. He also appears to be well-versed in Mimamsa and Grammar. The commentary does not often discuss the minutiae of various rites.  Besides surviving texts, the commentary also quotes the lost Baijavapa Grhyasutra belonging to the Sukla Yajurveda, and a Kathaka Parisishta.</p>
<p>Followers of the Manavagrhyasutra are typically Modha Brahmins of Gujarat, as is apparent from the colophons of manuscripts of these texts.</p>
<p>Add note on Vinayaka rituals in the Grhyasutra.</p>
<p>A Hindi translation cum commentary on this text was published by Pandit Bhimasena Sharma, the principal disciple of Swami Dayanand Sarasvati (founder of Arya Samaj) in Vikrami Samvat 1861. The work was printed by Vedaprakash Yantraalaya located in Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh.</p>

<ol>
<li>Commentary by Sivadasa, the son of Narada. This is the earliest commentary on the text and its extent in shlokas is 1000. A manuscript exists in the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal [HARAPRASAD SHASTRI 1923: 460-461]. The introductory verses state that the commentary was composed in Varanasi, and that the author compared his text with the Sulbasutra of Baudhayana, in order to point out the differences between the two. Sivadasa also claims that the author of the Sulvasutra was none other than Manu who composed the famous Manusmriti. He calls his Sakha as ‘Manu-Maitri’ Sakha.</li>
</ol>
<p>A Marathi translation of Manava, Katyayana, Apastamba and Baudhayana Sulvasutras was published in 1978 from Mumbai by R. P. Kulkarni [KASHIKAR 1996: 4].</p>
<p>Parisishtas</p>
<p>The Varahas have 22 Parisistas. Of these, the Chaturhotrka, Gonamika and Chhando’anukramani were published by Raghuvira. While a Frenchman Pierre Rolland (1940-74) published studies (in French) on the Vrstotsarga, Rahasya and Bhutotpatti. He also wrote a study (unpublished) on another Parisishta called the Grhyapurusha, which, according to PARPOLA [1976], casts an important light on ancient Indian architecture.</p>

<p>“The Samaveda occupies a unique position in music history, for it preserves probably the world’s oldest notated melodies.

<li>Tamil Nadu: Followers of Kauthuma Samaveda are found in most towns of this state. They recite not only the Samhita together with the Samans, but also the Chhandogya Upanishad. The Kauthuma Samhita is recited utilizing 6 musical notes. STAAL [1961:19] states that the recitation of the Upanishad text is derived from printed editions, and not from an unbroken oral tradition. Consequently, the Upanishad text is not recited with the Vedic accent, since the printed editions do not bear the accent marks. Instead, it is recited in the bhASika svara “an even murmur”, also termed as the daNDaka recitation [STAAL 1961:27].</li>

<h3 id="samhita-1">Samhita</h3>
<p>The Samaveda Samhita is of two types- the Archika samhita containing the mantras, and the Gaana comprising of the melodies.</p>
<p>Samavediya Archika Samhita: The Kauthuma Samhita of the Samaveda comprises of 1875 mantras of which 1800 are found in the published Rigveda Samhita. According to Damodara Satavalekar, the remaining verses are to be found in manuscripts of the Shankhayana Shakha of the Rigveda. The verses of Samaveda are divided into two books: The Purvarchika and the Uttarachika. The verses are accented, and contrary to the notations in the manuscripts of the other Vedas, the accents in the Kauthuma Samaveda are marked by inserting numbers and a few letters above the text of the mantras. The Purvarchika comprises of mantras address to Agni, Indra and Soma. These verses form the backbone of the Gramageyagana songbook. The Gramageyagana comprises of 1 or more melody to which each verse of the Purvarchika, taken in order, is set.</p>

<h3 id="chhandogya-mantra-brahmana">Chhandogya Mantra Brahmana</h3>
<p>The Chhandogya Brahmana is a work of ten divisions called ‘Prapathakas’ and comprises of two parts –</p>
<p>Prapathakas 1-2 form the Mantra Brahmana or the Mantra Parvan and contain mantras used in Grhya rites.</p>
<p>Prapathakas 3-10 constitute the famous Chhandogya Upanishad.</p>
<p>The various early printed editions of the Mantra Brahmana are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>SAMASRAMI Satyavrata. 1872. Serampore. The text contained in this edition is imperfect, being based on faulty manuscripts. A Bengali translation and an original commentary in Sanskrit is included</li>
<li>SAMASRAMI Satyavrata. 1890. Calcutta. The editor revised his first edition with the assistance of more manuscripts that gave a more correct text. He has also revised his Sanskrit commentary to correspond to the new readings.</li>
<li>HALLE Heinrich Stonner. 1901. Das Mantrabrahmana. – This work deals only with the first Prapathaka, and has an accompanying German translation.</li>
<li>JÖRGENSEN Hans. 1911. Darmstadt. – This edition contains the text, a German translation and the commentary of Sayana of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Prapathaka alone</li>
</ol>
<p>Thereafter, the text was published with the commentary of Sayanacharya by Bellikoth Ramakrishna SARMA, and with the commentaries of Gunavishnu and Sayanacharya by Durgamohan BHATTACHARYA [1958].</p>
<p>Commentatorial Tradition:</p>
<p>Two traditional commentaries exist on the Mantrabrahmana.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gunavishnu: He was a native of Bengal, and lived before the 12<sup>th</sup> century AD, since he has been quoted by Raghunandana and others from that period. BHATTACHARYA [1958] has published this commentary and I refer to his description of the same [p. xxiv]– “In an introductory verse, Gunavishnu has modestly described himself as faltering in the correct explanation of the words and their meanings. He has however explained in his commentary many items of etymological interest, and cleared up various points of syntactical obscurities by referring to the Nighantu and the Nirukta and by quoting the rules of Mimansa. He has quoted passages from a number of works including the Brahmana, the Upanishad, the Gryhasutra and the Dharmasutra. In determining the application of mantras in different rites, Gun has always quoted the Gobhilagrhyasutra in support. He has therefore followed the Kauthuma Sakha of the Samaveda prevelant in Bengal. In grammatical discussions, he has cited the sutras of Panini throughout, and has sometimes quoted the Kasikha and the Rgveda Pratisakhya as well. Gun was well conversant with the characteristic traditions of the different Vedic schools, as otherwise he could not have boldly adopted the Mantra-readings, which are, as he himself pointed out, opposed to the Rgvedic texts.”</li>
<li>Sayanacharya: The commentary, like his other Vedic commentaries, is titled the ‘Vedarthaprakasha’ and was apparently authored after he had already completed his commentaries on the Samhitas of the Rigveda, Yajurveda and the Samaveda. Sayana often borrows from Gunavishnu’s commentary, without mentioning his name. He supplements his comments with liberal quotations from the Khadira Grhyasutra (which was prevalent instead of the Gobhila Grhyasutra in South India) together with Rudraskanda’s commentary on the same. Often, his readings of the Mantrabrahmana are superior to those adopted by Gunavishnu [BHATTACHARYA 1958:xxvi]</li>
</ol>
<p>That the two parts have always been considered as constituting one whole can be inferred from the fact that Shankaracharya has quoted from both of them as ‘the Sruti of Tandins’ while commenting on Brahmasutra 3.2.25,26,36</p>
<p>Coming to the Mantra Brahmana, each of the two Prapathakas is further subdivided into eight khandas, or sections. The entire text has 268 mantras, including the 11 additional formulae noted in the most ancient extant commentary by Gunavishnu. These mantras are pre-supposed by the Grhyasutras of Khadira and Gobhila, which prescribe them for various Grhya rites. In fact, the order of the mantras on the Mantra Brahmana parallels the corresponding rites in the Grhyasutras, in the same order. It is as if the Grhyasutras and the Mantra Brahmana complement each other. Certain western Indologists like Oldenberg [SBE XXX, p. 4-8] take this to conclude that the Grhyasutras and the Mantra Brahmana were composed simultaneously. Other Indologists however assume the priority of the Brahmana to the Grhyasutras, following the Indian tradition. Rudraskanda, while commenting on the opening sutra of the Khadira Grhyasutra, clearly states that the sutra presupposes the knowledge of the Brahmana, thereby suggesting that he considered the Brahmana to be older than the Sutra.</p>
<p>The very fact that both the Khadira Grhyasutra (a text of the Ranayaniya or the Sardula Sakha of Samaveda) and the Gobhila Grhyasutra (a text of the Kauthuma Samavedins) presuppose the Mantra Brahmana, it automatically follows that the text belongs to the combined Kauthuma-Ranayaniya Samavedic tradition.</p>
<p>Devatadhyaya lays down the criterion for deciding the deity of the Samaganas.</p>
<p><strong>Samhitopanishad</strong> deals with the ‘secret’ aspect of the Samhitas, the collections of verses are grouped together for various purposes. It emphasizes the responsibilities of the great tradition of the Samaveda and the correct doctrine reflected therein, through the chosen line of disciples. This Brahmana is composed in the sutra style, divided into five chapters. It discusses vidhi, stoma, anuloma, pratiloma etc., in great detail. A few cosmogonic legends area also found in the text. Two commentaries exist on the text – one by Dvijararaja Bhatta, and the second is the Vedarthaprakasha of Sayanacharya.</p>

<ol>
<li>Vakyakara Brahmanandin: A brief comment, called the ‘Vakya’. The work is considered lost but extensive quotations from it are encountered in the works of Advaitins and Vishishtadvaitins. I have collected these.</li>
<li>Bhasyakara Dramidacarya: A commentary on # 1 above. Large and small extracts from the Bhashya are encountered in works like Vedarthasamgraha and Shri Bhashya of Shri Ramanujacharya, subcommentaries thereon by Sudarshana Suri, Rudraskanda’s vrtti on Drahyayana Kalpa; Parashara Bhattar’s commentary on the Sri Vishnu Sahasranama and so on. I have collected these.</li>
<li>Shankaracharya (Advaita): He terms his Bhashya as a short ‘Vrtti’ in the introductory portion. Anandagiri explains that the word ‘short’ is used to contrast it with the massive commentary of Dramidacharya. The commentary refers to some textual variants.</li>
<li>Bhaskara Bhatta (Bhedabheda perspective): Lost, and referred to in Bhaskara’s own commentary on the Brahmasutras. Numerous citations from this work are actually encountered with in the Tippana of Narottama Puri (see below). From these extracts it is clear that Bhaskara pre-supposed the Bhashya of Shankaracharya on this Upanishad, and criticized it in his own commentary. This might be taken as conclusive proof for the genuine character of Shri Shankaracharya’s commentary on the Chhandogya Upanishad.</li>
<li>Narendra Puri: A brief comment (‘Tippana’) on Shankaracharya’s commentary. It criticizes the Bhashya of Bhaskara in a very vitriolic language.</li>
<li>Madhvacarya (Dvaita perspective): Characteristic of his style, he interprets numerous passages in a very different manner than other traditional commentaries on the text. Significant philosophically is his unique interpretation of the <em>mahavakya ‘Tat tvam asi’</em> in the 6<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Upanishad. Madhvacharya interprets it as ‘<em>atat tvam asi’</em> and marshals numerous reasons for doing so.</li>
<li>Anandagiri: A gloss (= Tika) on Shri Shankaracharya’s Bhashya. It follows the Tippana of Narottama Puri very closely, especially in the identification of allusions to the Dramida Bhashya in Shankaracharya’s commentary. The Tika is written in the characteristic lucid style of Anandagiri, and contains some original citations from the Dramida Bhashya as well, indicating that the Dramida Bhashya was available to him.</li>
<li>Sudarashana Suri: Bhashya on the Upanishad from a Vishishtadvaita Vedanta perspective.</li>
<li>Jnananananda: ‘Chandrika’ on the Upanishad from an Advaita Vedanta perspective</li>
<li>Balakrishnananda: ‘Vivarana’ on the Upanishad from an Advaita Vedanta perspective</li>
<li>Shankarananda: Dipika on the Upanishad from an Advaita Vedanta perspective</li>
<li>Abhinava Narayanendra Saraswati: Pupil of Jnanendra Saraswati. The Tika is written from an Advaita Vedanta perspective.</li>
<li>Swami Vidyaranya: 3rd, 4th and 5th chapters of Swami Vidyaranya&rsquo;s anubhUTiprakAsha. It&rsquo;s not strictly a commentary, though. The chapters are called shvetaketuvidyA-prakAsha, sanatkumAravidyA-prakAsha and prajApatividyA-prakAsha. Pl. see Godabarisha Mishra&rsquo;s critical edition published by the Univ of Madras.</li>
<li>Sayanacharya (Advaita): The commentary has been published on the basis of 2 manuscripts- one from Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and the other from the Oriental Research Institute at Mysore (ref. 1). The Dipika, as the commentary is called, is a very lucid paraphrase that follows the Bhasya of Sri Shankaracharya very closely. From the colophons, it is apparent that Sayana wrote this work after completing his commentary on the Samhitas of Rigveda, Samaveda and Yajurveda. In addition to Sri Samharacharya’s Bhasya, the Dipika has relied heavily on the Vaiyasika Nyayamala of Swami Bharati Tirtha, and quotes the same very frequently. In fact, the Dipika might be regarded as a very lucid gloss on the Bhasya of Sri Samkaracharya, and supplements the latter with additional quotes from a plethora of Vedic and Pauranic texts, and gives additional examples, textual analysis etc. to clarify the Upanishadic sentences. At the same time, the Dipika condenses the polemical sections of the Bhashya so that they are more comprehensible. In addition, Sayana wrote a metrical paraphrase of this text, along with 11 other principal Upanishads, in his work titled ‘Anubhuutiprakaasha’.</li>
<li>Vyasatirtha: A sub-commentary on Shri Madhvacharya’s Bhashya on the Chhandogya Upanishad, written obviously from a Dvaita Vedanta perspective. Like his other works, the sub-commentary is marked by acute fidelity to Madhvacharya’s Bhashya, and is superb for its logical acumen.</li>
<li>Vedesha Bhikshu, disciple of Vyasatirtha: ‘Padarthakaumudi’ on the Chhandogya Upanishad, from a Dvaita Vedanta perspective.</li>
<li>Rangaramanuja: Written from a Vishishtadvaita Vedanta perspective. Like his commentaries on most Upanishads, this is also a brief one and tries to incorporate comments on the relevant passages as far as they occur in the works of Shri Ramanujacharya. A noteworthy feature the work is that it cites all the Brahmasutras which refer to a particular passage of the Upanishad, while commenting on that passage. It is well known that the Brahmasutras do deal with only representative passages of the Upanisads and the principles enunciated in the text can be applied to many other parallel Upanisadic texts. This has been well demonstrated by Sri Rangaramanuja and he has applied the Brahmasutras profusely to arrive at a meaning of numerous passages of the Upanisads. Unfortunately, and contrary to expectations, Rangaramanuja does not give any new original citations from the Vakyagrantha or the Dramida Bhashya.</li>
<li>Dara Shikoh: A Persian translation written with the assistance of Sarvavidyanidhana Kavindracharya and other Pundits of Varanasi during the reign of Emperor Shah Jehan.

</ol>
<p>Recently, TARLEKAR [2001] has brought out a fresh edition of the text on the basis of several manuscripts. The edition also has a detailed English translation of all the sutras.</p>
<p>**3. Latyayana Srauta Sutra: **The name of this text indicates that it was authored by a resident of the ‘Latadesha’- a region which included coastal Sindh and Gujarat in ancient times, but got restricted to the region between Mahi and Tapi rivers of Gujarat in later times [ref. 7, pg. 84]. The first edition of the Latyayana Srauta Sutra was published by Ananda Chandra Vedantavagisha from Calcutta in 1872. RANADE [1998] has recently published a critical edition of the text, together with an English translation and notes, extracts from the traditional commentary of Agniswamin and also the textual variations in the analogous sutras of Drahyayana, in 3 volumes.</p>
<p>Although based primarily on the Tandya Brahmana, the text is fairly eclectic in that it quotes specific injunctions from the Brahmanas of Shatyayanis, Raurukis and so on. A very distinctive feature of the work is that it quotes the opinions of several older teachers (e.g. Gautama, DhAnamjaya, Sandilya, Sandilyayana etc.) of Samavedic ritual by name, contrasting and comparing their opinions on ritual minutiae more than a 100 times. It also presupposes the Arsheya Kalpa and the Masaka Kalpa, which are referred to by their names.</p>

<p><strong>Chhandogapara Sutra:</strong> The word ‘Apara’ in the title here is used for ‘after death’ and accordingly, this work contains directions for performing the funeral ceremonies of a Samavedin, and for rites meant to be performed on the 11th day after death (Ref. 1, Pg. 1065, no.1345). The age of this work could not be determined. According to Dikshitar, it is the composition of Gautama [ref.6, pg. 183], in which case it is a very ancient text.

<li>Riktantra: This text is also called the Rktantra Vyakarana or the Chhandoga Vyakarana. It is a Pratisakhya of Samaveda, in five prapathakas, and is alternately ascribed to Audavraji and Sakatayana. There exists no commentary on the first prapathaka, whereas the remaining prapathakas have a commentary called. An edition of the Rktantra has been published by Suryakanta [Ref. 10].</li>

<li>Samatantra: It is a Pratisakhya of Samaveda in 15 Prapathakas, and is attributed to Sage Audavraji. It deals with the rules for converting verses into Samans. It has been published from Varanasi by A. M. Ramanatha Dikshita, along with a commentary attributed to Sayanacharya [1961].  In reality, it appears that the ascription to Sayana is in error and that it is actually much older. The other commentaries of the text, all still in manuscript, are – Bhashya of Dayasamkara, Vrtti-sara of Nrisimha-datta, Samatrantra-bhashya of Ramakrshna Diksita (son of Damodara). [AITHAL 1991:630-632]</li>

<li>Matralakshana: Composed by Vararuchi.</li>
<li>Gautama Siksa or Gautamiya Siksa: It is related to the Samaveda and is attributed to Sage Gautam. It comprises of two Prapathakas of 8 khandas each. The work was first published in the ‘Siksa Samgraha’ from Varanasi. [AITHAL 1991:286-287].</li>

<h2 id="ranayaniya-shakha-of-samaveda">Ranayaniya Shakha of Samaveda</h2>
<p>The Ranayaniya is today found only in the south- in Shimoga and North Kanara districts of Karnataka, in Northern Andhra and southern Orissa [SHARMA 1991:78-79]</p>
<p>Recordings of Ranayaniya Samagas from Tinnevelly (Tamil Nadu) and from Gujarat are however available at Tirupati (HOWARD 1977:xix) indicating that this particular Shakha of the Samaveda has survived in these two areas up to recent times.</p>
<p>Communities of Ranayaniya Samavedins:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Karnataka: Havik Brahmin Samavedins of Honnavar, in the North Kanara Distrinct, are all Ranayaniyas. These Brahmins are worshippers of Lord Shiva, even though they might have Vaishnava names. In contrast, the Shivalli Brahmins of the South Kanara district are Vaishnavites, and followers of Madhvacharya (Dvaita Vedanta) and give Jaiminiya as their Sakha. Somayagas were performed by Havik Brahmins till the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but this tradition has now died out [HOWARD 1977: 114]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajasthan: Of the 12 Gotras of the Dahima Brahmins of Rajasthan, the following adhere to the Ranayani Sakha of Samaveda, together with the Gobhila Sutra – Vatsa, Kautsa, Kasyapa, Sandilya [ASOPA 1988:23-29]. These Samavedin Brahmins worship Lord Vishnu and tie their top knot of hair to the left side of their heads.</p>

<h2 id="jaiminiya-samaveda-sakha">Jaiminiya Samaveda Sakha</h2>
<p>The Finnish scholar Asko Parpola has made a significant contribution to the understanding of the Jaiminiya Samaveda, and his publication. For an almost complete overview of literature (manuscript and published) pertaining to the Jaiminiya Samaveda, refer Parpola [1973]. This web-page excerpts Parpola’s writings extensively, supplementing them with excerpts from works by other authors.</p>
<p><strong>Maharshi Jaimini:</strong> The Mahabharata declares that Sage Veda Vyasa compiled the four Vedas towards the end of dvaapara-yuga, and imparted them to four disciples respectively. Samaveda was imparted to Maharshi Jaimini. Sabha Parvan 4.17 of the same text mentions that the Sage was present in the reign of King Yudhishthira, while Adiparva 48.6 states that he was the <em>udgaata</em> in the <em>sarpayajna</em> of King Janmejaya. The latter context also mentions that Jaimini belonged to the Kautsa gotra.</p>
<p><strong>Brahmin Communities</strong>: The Jaiminiya Shakha is confined to Kerala and Tamil Nadu and its adherents are found among the Namudiri Brahmins if Malabar and in a section of the Brahmins of Tamil Nadu called Choliyapatters in Palghat and in Chidambaram [SHARMA 1991:79]. Veda Vyasa [1930] supplies details on the epigraphical attestations of the Jaiminiya school.</p>
<p>Parpola [1973:9] is certain that the Jaiminiya Sakha was named as the Satyayani Sakha in ancient times. The Satyayani Brahmana is the most often quoted of all the Brahmanas supposedly lost, and most of these quotations agree with analogous passages in the Jaiminiya Brahmana. Others have minor differences, or are verbal paraphrases. Parpola [ibid] argues that the minor discrepancies between the quoted Satyayanaka passages and the Jaiminiya Brahmana passages should not be taken as a proof that the two texts are different because such a discrepancy is seen between the quotations of extant Brahmanas in other works as well. In support of his contention that the Jaimini Sakha is identical with the Satyayani Sakha, Parpola [1973:9] notes that in the Jaiminiya Srautasutra, teachers Satyayani and Tandi are quoted side by side. Secondly, the title of the JUB, as preserved in the text itself, is Satyayani Gayatrasyopanishad. In addition, the name of Jaimini or his epithet ‘Talavakara’ is never found in the list of Acharyas (in Jaiminiya Grhya Sutra 1.14) is never found in ancient texts, but only in later commentaries.</p>
<p>Nambudiris: According to the most comprehensive studies undertaken, approximately 35% of the Nambudiris are Rigvedins, 50% are Yajurvedins and just about 1/8% are Samavedins. The rest are excluded from Vedic study [STAAL 1961:35-36]. Staal [1961] gives a list of the Nambudiri families that follow the Jaiminiya Sakha to this day. Nambudiri recitations are extremely rhythmic, in contrast to the Tamil recitations, which are more musical. HOWARD [1977: 200] estimates that the Namudiri Jaininiya tradition will surely become extinct in near future because exponents of this tradition are now all old, and they refuse to teach the Samaveda to other Namudiris who belong to the Rgveda or Yajurveda by birth.  Fortunately, due to the efforts of Asko Parpola, E. R. Sreekrishna Sarma and Frits Staal, all the Jaiminiya chants have been recorded and thus have been preserved for posterity.</p>
<p>Since the Kerala Jaiminiya tradition is on the verge of extinction, a news item on a recent attempt to revive it is worth quoting in detail –</p>

<p>VHP helps scholars of a Sanskrit chanting legacy start new school</p>
<p>2002-05-30 Published by Hinduism Today Gathered by Staff Reporter</p>
<p>TRIVANDRUM,MAY 30: The ancient Jaiminiya Sama Vedic tradition, a Sanskrit chanting system practiced in the South Indian state of Kerala long ago, is on the verge of extinction. There are only a few scholars alive today who are qualified to teach the recitation of the Vedas in this obscure method, and they reside only in certain parts of Kerala and at Thiruvaiyuru in Tamil Nadu&rsquo;s Tanjavur district. Of these experts there are said to be only five who can chant in this system perfectly without error, and they are all in their late seventies. These five masters are the teachers at a new Veda Vidya Peetham, a school established by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to pass on Vedic knowledge to children in the Panjal village of Kerala&rsquo;s Thrissur district.Classes at the new school are taught in the oral tradition, as they have been from ancient times. According to the school secretary, their aim is to creat the &ldquo;atmosphere of the age-old gurukul tradition,&rdquo; and no corporal punishment is used. On the school grounds are a main building, library and residential accommodations for students. At present, less than ten children attend. Commenting on the new peetham, his Holiness, Sankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakodipeetham, Jagat Guru Jayendra Saraswathi said, &ldquo;I am proud of Kerala for two things: One, it is the land of Adi Sankara. The other is that it is the home of the rare Jaiminiya Sama Veda tradition, still preserved today for our country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tamil Jaiminiyas: They hail from the Thanjavur/Tiruchirapalli region, and call themselves Talavakaras – another name for the same Sakha [HOWARD 1977: 163]. A PaaThashaala was established a few decades ago at Srirangam for teaching the Jaiminiya Samaveda [Parpola 1973:6]. Raghavan [1957 and 1962] has given a traditional list of the villages of Talavakara Brahmins around Srirangam. Parpola opines [1973:23] that the Tamil and Kerala Jaiminiya traditions have existed in mutual isolation for at least the last thousand years. He suggests that in Tamil Nadu, the nucleus of the Jaminiyas has been the Chola country, with the great temple centers of Srirangam, Thanjavur and Chidambarah. The communities in Tirunalveli (known to have lived their at least since the 16<sup>th</sup> century CE from epigraphic evidence) and Palghat represent emigrations from this nucleus area.</p>
<p>Shivalli Kannadiga Jaiminiyas: The Shivalli Brahmins of the South Kanara district are Vaishnavites, and followers of Madhvacharya (Dvaita Vedanta) and give Jaiminiya as their Sakha. The famous Hastamalakacharya, a direct disciple of Sri Shankaracharya, belonged to this community, which was converted to Dvaita Vedanta by Madhvacharya himself, per tradition. No information is available about survival of Samaveda amongst Shivalli Brahmins. The Maharnava, a commentary on the Charanavyuha, states that the Jaiminiyas reside in Karnataka. However, the Jaiminiyas have not been attested outside Kerala and Tamil Nadu as of yet [Parpola 1973:23]. Parpola however refers to a statement by E. R. Sreekrishna Sarma that the Jaiminiyas reside also in Mysore, but this has not been verified so far.</p>
<h3 id="archika-samhita">Archika Samhita</h3>
<p>The root text of the Jamainiyas, on which their melodies are based, is the Jaiminiya Archika Samhita. This text runs parellel to the Kauthuma Samhita of Samaveda, available in easily accessible editions.</p>
<p>Caland first published a bare-bones edition of the text, noting only the first and the last words of the mantra, noting their deviations from the corresponding Kauthuma texts. The edition has a very learned introduction. In 1938, Raghuvira published the complete Devanagari text of the samhita, with the full text of the mantras. The published texts do not have the accent notation like the Kauthuma Samhita. The Jaiminiya Archika Samhita is still recited from memory by the Samavedis among the Namudiri community.</p>
<p>The manuscripts used by Caland all hailed from districts Tirunalveli, Trichy and Thanjavur of Tamil Nadu. Parpola [1973:21-22, fn.3] has noted that the manuscripts from Kerala are slightly different as far as the divisions of the archikas is concerned. For instance, in the Kerala version, the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 7<sup>th</sup> khanda of the third kanda have 9 and 11 verses, whereas Caland’s edition has 10 verses each. Likewise, in Caland’s edition, several Khandas are very large and are split up into smaller sections in the Kerala tradition. There are several other similar differences.</p>
<p>No padapaatha of the Samhita is available. A work named Stobhapadam is available in manuscript at the Trivandrum Library and Parpola [1973:16] suspects that it is a catalog of stobhas linked to the Samhita.</p>
<p>Samans of the Jaiminiya Samhita</p>
<p>The Jaiminiya chants can be subdivided into 3 variations according to Staal [1961]:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Nambudiri chants,</li>
<li>Thanjavur/Thiruchi districts in Tamil Nadu</li>
<li>Tirunalveli district and the area close to Palaghat (Kerala)in Tamil Nadu</li>
</ol>
<p>The notation used by the manuscripts of the Jaiminiya Gramageya and the Aranyaka ganas and their relationship to the actual recitations was a mystery till recently, although the text ‘Dharanalakshana’ (of Sabhapati) which explains the same has been known to exist for several decades. There is a modern commentary called ‘Samalakshanam’ which explains the relevant passages of the Dharanalakshana and describes the notation used in the ganas of the Jaminiya Samaveda [Parpola 1973:18]. It must be noted however that the Dharanalakshana is primarily related to the Tamil style of Jaiminya recitations.</p>
<p>The Uttaragana of Jaiminiya Sakha was perilously close to extinction in 1971, when Staal and Parpola collaborated with a traditional chanter Sri Itti Ravi Namudiri, to record the same for posterity. I shall reproduce the words of Parpola [1973:21-22] that narrate this great saga:</p>
<p>“A plan to edit the Jaiminiya Ganas brought J. F. Staal for the third time in 1970-71 and me for the first time in 1971 to India. He main aim was the recovery of material on the Uttara-Ganas. It turned out that Sri Itti Ravi Namudiri, who had been the main Jaiminiya informant in Kerala of both Bake and Staal on his previous tours, knew only part of the text, and that the man who knew the rest had died recently. However, with the tape-recorder presented to him by Staal, Itti Ravi has subsequently recorded the entire text that he has reconstructed with the help of his pupils. The recordings of the Uttara-Gana, comprising fifty hours, have been bought this year jointly by the Department of Philosophy of the University of California at Berkeley and the Scandinavian Institute of Asian Studies in Copenhagen. Even the Purva-Gana has recently been recorded in its entirety by Itti Ravi and a pupil of his for E. R. Sreekrishna Sarma.</p>
<p>Manuscripts of the Ganas, including the Uttara, are also available: Itti Ravi and one of his pupils have written down (without the svaras) the chant from their memory. The Uttara-Gana consists, according to Itti Ravi, of the Uha-Gana comprising 8 pattus [=Skt. Dasatis] divided into 77 ottus and making together 812 samans, 509 of which are on tristichs and 303 on single verses, and of the Usani, the secret chants, in 16 ottus comprising together 159 samans. If we compare these figures with the information of the Dharanalakshanam, we notice a great difference, for according to Sabhapati the Uham comprises 1802 samans and the Rahasyam 356 samans, which together with the 1523 samans of the Prakrti make up the grand total of 3681 samans. The number of the Prakrti-Gana is almost the same in Kerala. However, if 509 is multiplied by three for the tristichs, as one should, according to Itti Ravi, the Uha-Gana comprises in Kerala 1821 samans.”</p>
<p>Parpola also unearthed a manuscript of a text called Uhaprastava, which provides means of control on the Uttaragana.</p>
<p>The Tamil Jaiminiya Uttaragana tradition is fragmentary and although complete manuscripts exists, the oral tradition comprises of a selection of a few samans [Parpola 1973:22].</p>
<h3 id="brahmanas">Brahmanas</h3>
<p>Three Brahmanas from the Jaiminiya Samaveda Sakha are known – Jaiminiya Brahmana, Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana and Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana.</p>
<h3 id="jaiminiya-brahmana">Jaiminiya Brahmana</h3>
<p>In 1879, Burnell noted that the manuscripts of this text described it as the Talavakara Brahmana although the followers of this Sakha termed is as the Jaiminiya Brahmana. Burnell also noted that the famous Kena Upanishad formed the last but one book of this Brahmana [Parpola 1973:7]. Burnell also noticed the great similarity between the quotations from the now lost ‘Satyayana Brahmana’ occurring in the Sayanabhashya of Rigveda and some passages in the Jaiminiya Brahman. However, he refrained from concluding an identity between the Satyayana Brahmana and the Jaiminiya Brahmana because the followers of the latter believed firmly that the two Sakhas were different. The JB is related to the Tandya Brahmana on one hand and to the Satapatha Brahmana on the other. Complete translation of the text is yet to appear, although Ranade is said to be preparing one, to be published by the IGNCA (Delhi). The portion 1.1-65, dealing with the Agnihotra/Pranagnihotra, has been translated by Bodewitz in 1973. Subsequently, Bodewitz also published the remaining portion of the first adhyaya of the Brahmana, dealing with the Jyotishtoma ritual. By and large, the manuscript material available for the text is replete with defects. Witzel informs that the oral tradition of the Brahmana, presumable more accurate and defect free compared to the written textual tradition, was alive as late as the 1960’s when the last known Nambudiri reciter died before he could be recorded.</p>
<h3 id="jaiminiya-upanishad-brahmana">Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana</h3>
<p>This text is also known as the Talavakara Aranyaka and is the only extant Aranyaka of Samaveda. In the introduction to his commentary on the Kena Upanishad, Shankaracharya states that the Upanishad forms the beginning of the 9<sup>th</sup> chapter of Brahmana of that Sakha. In the extant manuscripts, the Kena Upanishad forms the 10<sup>th</sup> Anuvaka of the Upanishad Brahmana section, which occurs in the 4<sup>th</sup> Adhyaya of the Jaiminiya Brahmana proper. The JUB is then followed by the Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana. The text was first published by Hanns Oertel in 1884 and a Devanagari transcript of the same was published by Rama Deva from Lahore in 1921. The latter edition has a good introduction on the literature of Samaveda by Bhagavad Datta. B. R. Sharma brought out an improved edition, utilizing some more manuscript material in 1967, omitting Anuvakas 4.18-27 (the Kena Upanishad) and also the two further anuvakas dealing with pranas and the savitiri. The Kena Upanishad is preceded by the Satyayani Gayatri Upanisad which ends at 4.17. Actually, the Satyayani Gayatri Upanishad also seems to be a later addition because the 3<sup>rd</sup> adhayaya of the JUB ends with the Vamsa whereas there is another Vamsa at 4.16-17.</p>
<p><strong>Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana</strong>:</p>
<p>A commentary on this text by Jayanta is extant, and occurs at the end of Bhavatrata’s Srautrasutra-Vrtti printed in 1966 [Parpola 1973:7]</p>
<h3 id="kena-upanisad">Kena Upanisad</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bhavatrata (unkown): Portion of a commentary on the entire Talavakara Aranyaka- manuscript preserved at the Vishvesvaranand Vedic Research Institute at Hoshiarpur, India</li>

<li>Damodara Satavalekara</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jaiminiya-srauta-sutra">Jaiminiya Srauta Sutra</h3>
<p>For a long time, only the first portion of the text (covering Agnishtoma) was known, as published by Gaastra in 1906. In 1966, Premnidhi Sastri published the commentary (Vrtti) of Bhavatrata (called Bhavatratiyam) on JSS, on the basis of a solitary manuscript. Unfotunately, the sutra text was not recoverable from the Vrtti since Bhavatrata quoted only the initial and last words of the Sutras. Fortunately, in 1966, Parpola detected a manuscript containing the Sutra text of all the three portions – Agnishtoma, Kalpa and Parisesha/Paryaya, at Thanjavur. The Paryayaadhyaaya also includes a ‘Pratihaara’ sutra of Abhisrenya. Hitherto, the manuscript had been mis-identified in the catalog as the ‘Masaka Kalpa’. The first 10 folios of the manuscript were missing, but the Sutras of the missing portion could nevertheless be retrieved from the Prayogavrtti of Candrasekhara Bhattarya, which was preserved in the same codex [Parpola 1973:15].</p>
<p>Commentatorial Tradition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bhavatratiyam or the Vrtti of Bhavatrata: Parpola is preparing a critical edition of the entire JSS together with the commentary of Bhavatrata as several new manuscripts of the Bhavatratiyam have been unearthed by him. The Vrtti is a very learned commentary. Bhavatrata’s commentary on the Kausitaki Grhyasutra has also been published. In addition, he wrote commentaries on the Jaiminiya Grhyasutra, on Taittiriya Aranyaka and Jaiminiya Aranyaka. His father Matrdatta, composed a commentary on the Hiranyakesin Grhyasutra. Legends and traditions concerning Bhavatrata are still remembered by Nambudiri Brahmins living where the Vrttikara lived 13 centuries ago [Parpola 1973:15]</li>
<li>Prayogavrtti by Candrasekhara Bhattaraya – see above</li>
<li>Kratudipika of Kurangaraja</li>
<li>Adhanapurva-agnishtoma-prayoga of Srinivasa Adhvarindra</li>
<li>Sarvanukramani (dealing with the Darsapurnamasa, adhana, agnihotra and istiprayashittas) by Srinivasa Adhvarindra</li>
<li>Anonymous prayogas like Adhanagnishtomasamani, Agnishtomasama and Atiratrasama</li>
<li>Srutaadhaanakriyaakarma. Parpola [1973:16] has listed a few other works as well, pertaining to the Jaiminiya Srauta tradition.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jaiminiya-grhyasutra">Jaiminiya Grhyasutra</h3>
<p>The text was first published with the Subodhini commentary of Srinivasa Adhvarin by Kasturi Rangacarya in 1898 from Madras [Parpola 1973:12-13]. Subsequently, Caland published the Grhyasutra with the same commentary together with an introduction in Dutch in 1905. This edition was reprinted in 1922 from Lahore with an English translation and the earlier introduction also translated into English.</p>
<p>Parpola has studied the chronological relationship between all the Grhyasutras of Samaveda (Jaiminiya, Khadira and Gobhila) and has concluded that the JGS is the oldest [Parpola 1968:70].</p>
<p>The following Bhashyas and Prayogas etc. exist on the JGS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vrtti of Bhavatrata: Still in manuscript. An edition with a translation is under preparation by Asko Parpola. The edition is proposed to come out in the Kalamulashastra series of the IGNCA Publications Division (New Delhi) sometime in future.</li>
<li>Subodhini of Srinivasa Adhvarin</li>
<li>Karika of Tarunagnihotrin</li>
<li>Anukramanika</li>
<li>Prayogavivarana by A. Rangasvai Aiyangar, published in 8 fascicules from Kummbhakonam in 1923. The author was an authority in the Jaiminiya ritual he died before completing the work. According to the preface (in Tamil), he has utilized all the above four works for his Vivarana [Parpola 1973:13]</li>
<li>Prayaoga of T. Rajagopala Aiyangar (1970), R. Narasimhan (1970) and K. S. Srinivasa Aiyar (1964 and n.d.) – these are listed by Parpola [1973:13]</li>
<li>Manuscripts exist of the following works [Parpola 1973:14] -Jaiminigrhyasutrakarika by Balagnihotrin; Jaiminigrhya Karika of Vinataananda, the work is also called Vainateyakarika; Jaiminiygrhyaprayoga and Prayogasara by the same author- it is uncertain if the three works are different or if they are same.</li>
<li>At the MGOML, numerous other works exist like the Jaiminiyagrhyamantravrtti, Jaiminiyagrhyaprayogaratnamala and so on.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="satyayana-sutra">Satyayana-Sutra</h3>
<p>In manuscripts, the text is also named as ‘Satyayana-proktani prayaschittani’; Satyayana-proktani grhyaprayaschittani’ and Satyayaniproktasarvaarishtasanti’. According to Caland [1920], the text is very old as it is referred to in the (un-published) Drahyayana Gryhaparisista. In fact, the text is very similar to portions of the Bharadvaja Grhyasutra, as noted by Caland.</p>

<h3 id="general-information-on-samaveda">General Information on Samaveda</h3>
<p>The Samaveda Samhita is of two types- the Archika samhita containing the mantras, and the Gaana comprising of the melodies.</p>
<p>Samavediya Archika Samhita: The Kauthuma Samhita of the Samaveda comprises of 1875 mantras of which 1800 are found in the published Rigveda Samhita. The verses of Samaveda are divided into two books: The Purvarchika and the Uttarachika. The verses are accented, and contrary to the notations in the manuscripts of the other Vedas, the accents in the Kauthuma Samaveda are marked by inserting numbers and a few letters above the text of the mantras.</p>
<p>The Purvarchika comprises of mantras addressed to Agni, Indra and Soma. The deity and the meter determines the order of the mantras. Appended to the Purvarchika is the Aranyaka Samhita.</p>
<p>The Uttaraarchika contains verses usually arranged in triads. The first verse of each triad is normally found in the Purvarchika as well.</p>
<p>Gana Books of Samaveda Samhita:</p>
<p>Samaveda has four gana books, comprising the hundreds of melodies chanted during Vedic ritual. These four books are: Gramageyagaana, Araanyakagaana, Uhagaana and Rahasyagaana. The first two are collectively called ‘Purvagaana’ or ‘Prakrtigana’ (= primary or prototype melodies).</p>
<p>The gramageyagaana contains melodies meant to chanted and learned within inhabited quarters (grama, or villages). These melodies are based on the mantras in the Purvarchika texts, and follow the sequence of these mantras. In ritual, the melodies are chanted in the order in which they occur in the gaana-book. Each mantra may be set to several gaanas, not just one. No graamageyagaana is set to any mantra from the Aranyakasamhita.</p>
<p>The Aranyakagaana, as the name suggests, are meant to be chanted away from human inhabitations, in forests, due to their potency, esoteric character. These melodies are based on mantras of the Aranyakasamhita, taken in serial order, although not all mantras of this portion of the Archika Samhita have melodies associated with them. Some Aranyakagaanas are also based on Purvarchika mantras, and these melodies are different from the corresponding gramageyagaana melodies on the same mantras. Purvagana forms part of the Swadhyaya of the Samhita, and are therefore considered Apaurusheya.</p>
<p>In contrast, Uttaragaana contains chants for ritual purposes, i.e., they are liturgical chants. These chants are considered ‘paurusheya’ and are based on mantras of the Uttararchika portion of the mantrasamhitaa. Since verses occur in triads in the Uttaraarchika, the Uttaragaanas are based on triads of verses (whereas the Purvagaanas are based on individual verses). The Uttaragana is divided into two sections known as the Uha and the Uhya or Rahasyagaana: the former borrows some melodies from the Gramageya while the second does so from the Aranyageya. Thus the Uttaragana closely follows the Purvagana in its structure, divisions and notations including the melodic notes. Or in other words, the Purvaganas (Gramageya and Aranyageya) form the archetypes of ganas, to which the Uttaragana based on the Uttararchika is adapted.</p>
<p>The Uha and Uhya ganas of Uttararchika are divided into seven divisions namely Dasharatra, Samvatsara, Ekaha, Ahina, Sattra, Kshudra and Prayaschitta. These names are clearly derived from the respective types of sacrifices at which the corresponding gaanas are chanted.</p>
<p>The Purvagaanas and Uttaragaanas are also respectively often referred to as rUpAntara and svarUpa gaanas.</p>
<p>B. R. SHARMA [1991:80-81] gives some additional information on the nature of Uttaraganas -</p>
<p>“Since they are the products of the human mind, the ganas of Uttararchika are normally name after the Rishis who had composed them. Each of these ganas is divided into five melodic units called Bhaktis to which two more Bhaktis namely Hinkara and Omkara are added- the former before the prastava and the latter before the udgitha- when the Saman melodies are being executed in sacrificial rits by the singers. These five melodic units are named as prastava, udgitha, pratihara, upadrava and nidhana respectively and they are changed by three singer-priests individually; for example, prastava by prastotar, udgitha by udgatar, pratihar and upadrava by pratihartar and lastly the nidhana, the concluding unit of  a Samagana, by all the three in chorus. In sacrificial sessions this is done sitting under the udumbara tree in the yajnashala. The ganas belonging to the Gramageya, as the word indicates, should be chanted in public but the ganas of Aranyegeya, also called the Rahasya, meaning secret, are to be studied and chanted away from the dusty path of life in a forest retreat secrecy. This rule equally applies to the Uha and Uhya or rahasya melodies of the Uttaragana-since they were adapted for the Gramageya and Aranyageya respectively. Therefore, these two collections of melodies namely Aranyageya of the Purvagana and Uhya of the Uttaragana are called Rahasyaganas, secredt melodies. Because the recitation and transmission of these ganas are exectuted in secrecy, every care is taken to see that these ganas are not transmitted to undeserving disciples. Among these the Rathantara and Brihat are the two Samans of great consequence, which are jealously guarded and kept secredt by the Samavedis for reason of great spiritual potency and magic power attributed to these ganas. In the case of the Rathantara in particular, great care is taken while it is being sung on certain special occasions.</p>
<p>The text of the Rathantara is replaced with the mystic sound bha while it is being chanted in public, but at the same time the entire text of the gana is sung in mind so that no one can even surrepititiously learn the mystical Saman by overhearing it. The gana of which the text is not ‘expressed’ but concealed in Stobhas, mystic syllables, is known in Saman parlance as aniruktagana, ‘unexpressed melody’. Here, in this context, the Brahmanas caution the singer telling him that whole replacing the consonants of the original melodies the vowels of those consonants should be carefully affixed to the concerned bhakaras, thus impregnating them with full mystic potency and esoteric value of the original text of the melody. The swaras, (vowels) are regarded as the lofe breath (prana) of consonants of the melodic text, to the bhakaras, the singer, in truth, transfers the full spiritual worth of the replaced melodic text to the anirukta-gana, ‘unexpressed melody’, sung with the original musical notes.</p>
<p>Pg. 81: The silent recitation of the mystic Samans is considered to be more effective since it is done with greater concentration of mind. Fruther the subtle vibration that is generated by the rain in this instance travels through the higher plane quicker in the right direction as projected by the mind. In the mechanical recitation audible to others this may not happen. For this reason, a student is always initiated in secrecy and the mantra, communicated to him by the guru, to begin with is to be recited in a low voice by him. But before he is left alone to do this, the guru sees that the mantra is correctly recited and the formalities are strictly followed by the initiated. The Samaganas are normally executed in order to create a congenial atmosphere by purifying the surroundings by means of the vibrational force generated by the nada of the Samaganas, appropriate to the occasion.”</p>
<p>He also makes a note of some mystical melodies, referred to Ashariragaanas [page 82]: “In this connect I must bring to the notice of the readers that there are references in the Vedas to some of the most secret melodies which are not known to any but to the great mystics who acquired these melodies through their sadhanas, their intensive spiritual exercise, by practicing penance and meditation. These secret melodies revealed to the Rishis, however, are not recorded in the books of the ganas nor are they based on the known Vedic texts; hence their structure, musical notation, the gamut of Saman notes are not known to any but the Sadhakas in this line. In fact these secret melodies are also called anrcam Sam, a gana sung not on Vedic text, meaning a gana entirely sung on stobhas, the mystical syllables, not recorded in any Vedic text or a gana tuned to the melodic notes alone without articulate text. Therefore this gana is also called ashariram sama, the gana having no visible physique i.e., the decipherable text, on which it is sung.”</p>

<p>The Samavidhana Brahman lists the following 13 as the foremost teachers of the Samaveda: Ranayani, Satyamugri. Durvasa, Bhaguri. Gaurudni, Gaulgulavi, Aupamanyava, DaraAla, Gargi Savarni, Varshganya, Kuthumi, Shalihotra, Jaimini</p>
<h3 id="impurity-of-samaveda">Impurity of Samaveda</h3>
<p>According the Manusmriti, the Samaveda should not be recited when the Rigveda and  Yajurveda are being recited. He further adds that the Samaveda is the Veda of the Pitars (manes). According to Dikshitar [ref. 1, pg. xi], this is nothing but an <em>arthavada</em>.</p>

<h2 id="saunaka-sakha-of-the-atharvaveda">Saunaka Sakha of the Atharvaveda</h2>
<p>The name ‘Saunakin’ as that of a Sakha is seen in Kausika Sutra 85.8, Vaitana Sutra 43.25 states that a person who seeks to know witchcraft should perform a Saunaka Sacrifice. In Atharvaveda Parisishta 24.10, the followers of this Sakha are referred to as ‘Saunakeyah’.</p>
<p>BLOOMFIELD [1890:xxxv] notes that the name is found in several corrupt variants outside such as ‘kunakhin’, ‘kaunakhin’ which may be explained in two ways –</p>
<ol>
<li>The phenomes ‘sh’ and ‘ka’ are seen to be interchangeable in India (e.g. Sharkota, and Karkotaka)</li>
<li>The name ‘kunakhin’, which means ‘sick-fingers’, is perhaps used with a malicious or a sinister intent, since this meaning is reminiscent of the evil sorcerers etc., who were often demonized as lepers with deformed up fingers.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sage-saunaka-in-hindu-tradition">Sage Saunaka in Hindu Tradition</h3>
<p>Saunaka is remembered as a Sage in Atharvaveda Parisishta 20.1; 23.3; 24.13; 26.1; 26.31; 54.1; 65.6; 71. Saunaka is mentioned along with Sage Devadarshi in Panini’s Ganapatha. In addition, Saunaka is mentioned in the Ashtadhyayi sutra 4.3.103.</p>
<h3 id="samhita-of-shaunaka-atharvaveda">Samhita of Shaunaka Atharvaveda</h3>
<p>According the edition of Damodar Satavalekar, there are 5977 mantras in the text. Of these, 1260 are repeated from RV (Sakala), 81 from YV (Madhyandina) and 1 from SV (Kauthuma). In addition, 230 mantras occur twice in the text. [Kapur 1983]</p>
<p>The first edition of the Saunaka Samhita was published by Rudolf Roth and D. Whitney from Berlin in 1855. This edition did not have the accents marked on the text.</p>
<h3 id="krama-and-jata-pathas">Krama and Jata Pathas</h3>
<p>Incomplete manuscripts of these Pathas exist in various libraries [Aithal 1991:64-65]. Professor Madhav Deshpande of the University of Michigan (at Ann Arbor) kindly informed me via an email on 03 December 2001, that he is preparing a critical edition of the following -</p>
<ol>
<li>Kramapatha of the 20<sup>th</sup> Kanda of the Samhita</li>
<li>Jatapatha of the 15<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> Kandas</li>
</ol>
<p>He has utilized 6 manuscripts available at Pune for preparing this edition.</p>
<p>Since the 20<sup>th</sup> kanda of this Samhita is almost wholly borrowed from the Rigveda Samhita, and the oral tradition of the Krama recital of the latter is still alive, it is worthwhile investigating the relationship between the kramapathas of the Rigveda and the 20<sup>th</sup> Kanda of the Shaunakiya Atharvaveda Samhita. Professor Deshpande informs me that while the kramapatha of the Atharvaveda Samhita is clearly based on the Rigveda Kramapatha, it has been integrated quite well into the tradition of Atharvaveda. Dr. Deshpande notes that the “G<code>alitas in the Kramapatha for the 20th Kanda show several examples where the Rks occurring in other Kandas are treated as Galitas in the 20th Kanda. This is one of the main indications of the integration of the 20th Kanda with the rest of the AV Samhita&quot;. It is hoped that this edition is published soon.</code></p>
<h3 id="oral-traditionsgeographical-distribution">Oral Traditions/Geographical Distribution</h3>
<p>According to Staal [Howard 1986:110], Atharvavedic recitation is extant only in a few villages of Gujarat, where it was discovered by the Shankaracharya of Dvaraka. However, epigraphy attests to the presence of Atharvaveda across India in earlier times: At Nirmanda on river Satluj (7<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E. probably), at Nellur in Andhra Pradesh (7<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.), near Bijapur in Karnataka (6<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.) and at Bhavnagar in Gujarat (7<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.). Haug [ibid:372] also reported an Atharvavedic tradition in Poona around the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.</p>
<p><strong>Kashmir</strong>: A surprisingly large number of manuscripts of the Saunakiya Samhita exist in the collection of the erstwhile Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir<sup id="fnref:146"><a href="#fn:146" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">146</a></sup>. All these are unaccented, are of recent origin and are written by Kashmirian scribes, although it is not certain whether they were copied from Kashmirian originals or from originals from other parts of India<sup id="fnref:147"><a href="#fn:147" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">147</a></sup>. Only one of them is nearly complete, all the rest cover a few books of the Samhita. Therefore, in our present state of knowledge about these manuscripts, it is difficult to conclude from this collection that the Atharvaveda tradition in its Saunakiya version survived in Kashmir till the nineteenth century or so. It appears that this collection was ignored by VVRI in the preparation of their critical edition of the Saunakiya Samhita.</p>

<p>Persian Translation: According to some Muslim chronicles, the Atharvaveda was translated into Persian during the reign of Emperor Akbar. Badayūni remarks – “In this year a learned Brahman Shaikh Bhāwan, a converted Mussalman had come from Dakhin. His Majesty (Akbar the great) gave me the order to translated the Atharvana. Several of the religious precepts of this book resemble the laws of Islam. During the translation I found many difficult passages which even Shaikh Bhāwan could not interpret. I reported this to His Majesty, who ordered Shaikh Faizi and then Haji Ibrahim, to translate it. The latter, though willing, did not write anything. Among the precepts of the Atharvana there is one precept which says that no man will be saved unless he reads a certain passage. This passage contains many times ‘L’ and resemble very much ‘Lillāh’, ‘Illillāh’. Besides, I found that a Hindu under certain circumstances may eat cow flesh and also that Hindus bury their dead and do not burn them. With such passages the Shaikh used to defeat other Brahmans in argument and he had in fact led them to embrace Islam.” The Ain-I-Akbari of Faizi adds that the translation was entrusted to Hahi Ibrahim Sirhind and that the work was completed. However, no copy of this Persian translation exists today<sup id="fnref:148"><a href="#fn:148" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">148</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Hindi translation of Mahatma Tulasi Ram (d. 1915) of Amritsar – follows the Arya Samaj school of interpretation. This is probably the first translation of the Atharvaveda in any modern Indian language.

<p>Hindi translation by Kshemakaranadasa Trivedi – follows the Arya Samaj school of interpretation. Trivedi was born on 3<sup>rd</sup> November 1848 in Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh. He learnt Sanskrit from Swami Dayanand Sarasvati for some time, and promised him to write a commentary on Vedic texts. His commentary on the Atharvaveda was published in several parts between 1912 and 1921 and was subsequently reprinted by at least two other organizations. Trivedi also published an alphabetical word Index to the Atharvaveda Samhita in Vikrami Samvat 1978 from Narayana Yantraalaya located in Allahabad<sup id="fnref:149"><a href="#fn:149" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">149</a></sup>. The significance of this commentary lies in the fact that hitherto no complete translation or commentary existed on the Atharvaveda Samhita, the Bhashya of Sayanacharya also being fragmentary.</p>

<p><strong>Saubhagya Kanda of Atharvaveda</strong>: According to Atharvanic tradition, the Atharvaveda also has an esoteric and secret portion called the Saubhagya Kanda. Fragments or sections of this work exist in various libraries, and indicate that it is most likely a Tantric work. For instance, the Vaanchhaakalpalataa section exists in Alwar<sup id="fnref:154"><a href="#fn:154" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">154</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Atharvanarahasya</strong>: From various manuscript notices, it appears that the Atharvanarahasya was the name of a formalized or a non-formalized collection of various Upanishads, Upanishad-like texts, stotras and similar material which would be considered the ‘secret’ (rahasya) or the essence of Vedas (the Atharvaveda in this case) in classical Hinduism. Apparently, this collection had a Purvabhaga, and an Uttarabhaga or Uttarakhanda. For instance, a manuscript of the latte has been reported<sup id="fnref:155"><a href="#fn:155" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">155</a></sup>. The Gopalottaratapaniya Upanishad is sometimes considered a part of  Atharvanarahashya<sup id="fnref:156"><a href="#fn:156" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">156</a></sup>. A Narayanahrdayastotra and a Lakshmihrdaya exist in manuscript and are attributed to the Uttarakhanda of the Atharvanarahasya<sup id="fnref:157"><a href="#fn:157" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">157</a></sup>. Other texts included in the Atharvanarahasya are: Trisikhibrahmana (Upanishad)<sup id="fnref:158"><a href="#fn:158" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">158</a></sup>, Nrsimhapanjara, Mahalakshmihrdaya, Lakshmihrdayastotra, Sraavanikarmavidhi<sup id="fnref:159"><a href="#fn:159" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">159</a></sup>, Samayanyasraaddha vidhi, Siddhaantagita<sup id="fnref:160"><a href="#fn:160" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">160</a></sup>, Laksminarayahrdayastotra, Nrsimhapanjara (a Tantric work)<sup id="fnref:161"><a href="#fn:161" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">161</a></sup>. A commentary on the Atharvanarahashya by Govinda Shastri also apparently existed.<sup id="fnref:162"><a href="#fn:162" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">162</a></sup> It is apparent that the Atharvanarahashya is a collection of late texts.</p>
<p>Another text bearing the title ‘Atharvanarahashya’ was authored by a Dhiragovindasharma in the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. A manuscript of this text preserved at Oxford was utilized by Durgamohan Bhattacharya to publish it with a translation.</p>

<p>KUMAR [1981] has conducted a detailed study of the Rishis of Atharvaveda. According to him, there are 130 Rishis in Atharvaveda. The major contributors are -</p>
<p>Atharva – approximately 200 Suktas. As many as 57 Suktas in Kanda VI and all the 18 Suktas of Kanda 15 belong to him. The Seventh Kanda has 43 Suktas attributed to him [p. 52-52]. Significantly, the hymns of Rishi Atharvan typically do not have any other co-author.</p>
<p>Brahma – 101, Bhrgvangira – 29, Bhrgu – 27, Vishvamitra – 19, ShantAti – 17, Atharvangira – 16, Yama – 16, Vasishtha – 15, Medhyatithi – 14, ChAtana – 16, MadhuchhandA – 11, Shukra – 11.</p>
<p>The remaining 116 Rishis have less than 10 hymns attributed to them.</p>
<p><strong>Gopatha Brahmana:</strong> This is the only extant Brahmana of the Atharvaveda. There is no traditional commentary available on this Brahmana, although in his Triccabhaskara (written around 1710 C.E.), Bhaskara Raya refers to his own commentary on the text, although the context is not clear.[Bhaskararaya 8]</p>
<p>The Purvabhaga of the Gopatha Brahman exhibits more originality of content in that it glorifies the Athavan and its priests. In contrast, the Uttarabhaga follows the other Brahmanas in its content, although it introduces legends related to other Atharvan teachers. For instance, it introduces Idhma Angirasa and Barhi Angirasa in the prasitra legend at 2.1.2</p>
<p>PATYAL [1990] lists the following editions of this text –</p>

<p>In addition to the above Upanishads which have a definite link with the Atharvaveda tradition, a collection of 52 Upanishadic texts has also been circulation under the name of ‘Atharvana Upanishads’. This collection includes the texts listed above, and in addition one also finds well-known Upanishads belonging to the other Vedas. In their Atharvavedic version, these well-known Upanishads may show slight textual differences from their respective vulgate versions and could have a different name altogether. Thus, the Kathaka Upanishad is often named as ‘Atharvavalli Upanishad’<sup id="fnref:165"><a href="#fn:165" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">165</a></sup>, and the Nrsimhataani Upanishad as ‘Atharva Tapani Upanishad’<sup id="fnref:166"><a href="#fn:166" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">166</a></sup> in some manuscript colophons.</p>

<h4 id="kausika-sutra">Kausika Sutra</h4>
<p>In his introduction to his commentary on the Atharvaveda, Sayanacharya states that the Kausika Sutra is a ritual text used by followers of 4 Sakhas of the Atharvaveda, beginning with the Saunaka Sakha. Shankar Pandit, who published the commentary of Sayana on Atharvaveda for the first time, had determined [BLOOMFIELD 1890:xxxv] that these 4 Sakhas are Saunakiyas, Aksalas, Jaladas and Brahmavada.  The Aksalas are typically known by another name – the Jajalas {jAjala}.</p>
<p>The Kausika Sutra was first published by Maurice Bloomfield with extracts from traditional commentaries, in 1890 from New Haven (Connecticut, USA).</p>
<p>BAHULKAR [1990:117] lists the following commentaries on the text –</p>
<p>Darila Bhashya</p>
<p>Kesava Paddhati</p>
<p>Dasakarmani</p>
<p>Atharvanapaddhati</p>
<p>Prayogadipa of Devabhadra</p>

<p>Bahulkar is also preparing a critical edition of this text, which utilizes 9 manuscripts of which 7 are being used for the first time. The traditional division into Adhyayas, Kandikas and Sutras is being retained.</p>

<h2 id="paipplada-sakha-of-atharvaveda">Paipplada Sakha of Atharvaveda</h2>
<p>The name of the Sakha itself suggests that it follows the tradition of Rishi Pippalada, who is a celebrated Sage in numerous Hindu texts. In various lists and texts, the name is also alternately given as paippalAdaka, PaippalAdi, pippalAda, paippala, pippala, paippalayAna etc.</p>
<p>He is revered as a teacher in the colophons of certain manuscripts of the Atharvaprayaschittani Sutras.</p>
<p>The Pippaladi Shantigana (Atharvaveda Parisishta 34.20) commences with the very first mantra of the Paippalada Samhita.</p>
<p>Paippalada Brahmin Communities</p>
<p>In the Brahmayajna in southern India, when the opening lines of all the four Vedas are recited, the mantra ‘zaM no devIr abhiSTaya…’ represents the Atharvaveda. This mantra is in fact the opening mantra of the Paippalada Samhita of the Atharvaveda.</p>
<h3 id="paippalada-samhita">Paippalada Samhita</h3>
<p>The Samhita has been found in two versions: Kashmirian and Orissan. The former has approximately 6500 mantras, while the latter about 8000 mantras.</p>
<p>Pundit Dukhishyam Pattanayak [Samvat 2036] got the entire text of the Orissan Paippalada Samhita recited by the Brahmins of district Baripada recorded, and sent the same to the K. L. Janert of Cologne Unviversity (Germany). He also studied some additional manuscripts of the Samhita available at the Orissa State Museum at Bhuvaneshvar and has suggested several emendations to the text published by Durgamohan Bhattacharya. Pattanayak was to edit the entire text with the help of this manuscript material with the assistance of Pt. Yuddhishthira Mimamsaka, who was a lecturer of Sanskrit at the Bhuvaneshvar University for some time. However, the climate of the city did not suit Pt. Mimamsaka and he moved to north India. Perhaps that is the reason why the project of the publication of the entire text was given up.</p>
<p>Dipak Bhattacharya [1997] recent published Kandas 1-15 of the Paippalada Samhita from Calcutta, utilizing the manuscript material procured by his father Durgamohan Bhattacharya.</p>
<p>A critical edition and translation of kandas 13-14 was completed as his PhD thesis by Carlos Lopez of the Harvard University in June 2000.</p>
<p>Overall, it is believed that the Paippalada Samhita text is closer to the Ur-Atharvaveda than the Saunakiya text. NARANG [1981] has compared about 64 readings in the first 10 hymns in the AVZ and their corresponding versions in AVP (K and O) and concludes that in 29 cases, AVP appears better, in 9 instances, AVZ text is better. In 8 instances, both the versions seem to have altered the original text, while no decision can be made in 21 instances. Thus, overall, the Paippalada text appears to be better and older in comparison to the Saunaka text.</p>
<h3 id="paippalada-samhita-jatapatha">Paippalada Samhita Jatapatha</h3>
<p>A fragment of the Jata Patha of the Samhita exists in libraries of western India [Aithal 1991: 65]</p>
<h3 id="paippalada-brahmana">Paippalada Brahmana</h3>
<p>In the Prapachahridyaya, the anonymous author mentions the Paippalada Brahmana and states that it comprised of 8 chapters. This is intriguing.</p>
<p>Following Roth [Caland 1990:407], Witzel too opines that the Gopatha Brahman is an <em>anubrahmana</em> of the Paippalada Brahmana.</p>
<p>In the Anukramani prefixed to his commentary on the 8<sup>th</sup> Ashtaka of the Rigveda, Venkatamadhava states that he who studies the Paippalada Brahmana is a ‘vrddha’ (i.e. very knowledgeable). However, he quotes an ‘Atharvaveda Brahmana’ under RV and the citation matches Gopatha Brahmana</p>
<h3 id="prashna-upanishad">Prashna Upanishad</h3>
<p>Rishi Pippalada is the celebrated sage and teacher in this text, which consists of his replies to 6 disciples, who approach him with questions on various aspects of Hindu spirituality. As pointed out by BLOOMFIELD [1890:xxxiii], the colophons of a manuscript of the Upanishad at Berlin designates it as a text of this Sakha (‘iti pippalAdAtharvaNe sAkhAyAM praznopaniShat samAptA’).</p>

<h3 id="1-meaning-and-importance-of--veda">1. Meaning and Importance of  ‘Veda’</h3>
<p>The word Veda is often derived from 5 roots these days:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Vid jnaane</em>: To know</li>
<li><em>Vid sattaayaam</em>: To be, to endure</li>
<li><em>Vid labhe</em>: To obtain</li>
<li><em>Vid  vichaarane</em>: To consider</li>
<li><em>Vid chetanaakhyaananiveseshu</em>: To feel, to tell, to dwell</li>
</ol>
<p>To these roots is added the suffix ‘<em>ghaw</em>’ according to Ashtadhyayi 3.3.19, the celebrated text of Sanskrit grammar of Panini. Accordingly, the word Veda means ‘the means by which, or in which all persons know, acquire mastery in, deliberate over the various lores or live or subsist upon them.’</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Vedic literature as such signifies a vast body of sacred and esoteric knowledge concerning eternal spiritual truths revealed to sages (Rishis) during intense meditation. They have been accorded the position of revealed scriptures and are revered in Hindu religious tradition. Over the millennia the Vedas have been handed over generation to generation by oral tradition and hence the name “<strong>shruti</strong>” or “that which is heard”. According to tradition they are un-authored (apaurusheya) and eternal.</p>
<p>The Vedic literature is also called by several other names –</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nigama</strong>: Traditional wisdom transmitted from generation to generation</li>
<li><strong>Amnaaya</strong>: The root texts or primordial texts of (Hindu) tradition</li>
<li><strong>Trayi</strong>: The Vedic texts comprising of Versified mantras, prose mantras, and melodies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Theoretically, the Vedic corpus is held in deep reverence in the Hindu society. It constitutes the most authoritative genre of Hindu scriptures. Any other Hindu scripture must agree with the Vedas in order to be considered an authority. Schools of philosophy which reject the authority of the Vedas are considered ‘<em>Naastika</em>’ or heretical, while schools which accept Vedic authority, even if nominally, are considered ‘<em>Aastika</em>’ or orthodox, from a Hindu perspective.</p>
<p>While most Hindus never see Vedic texts in their lifetime, the term ‘Veda’ is used as a synonym for authoritativeness in religious matters. The Vedas are considered full of all kinds of knowledge, and an infallible guide for man in his quest for the four goals – <em>Dharma</em>, <em>Artha</em> (material welfare), <em>Kama</em> (pleasure and happiness) and <em>Moksha</em> (Salvation). In sacred Hindu literature, they are considered the very manifestation of God, and the ultimate source of all wisdom and of all Dharma.</p>
<p>Hindu priests were exhorted to study them regularly, recite their sentences, practice their sacraments and memorize their words. In practice however, this has been restricted to a dwindling minority of the Brahmin caste, despite recent attempts to revive Vedic study, ritual and recitation in the traditional manner. On the other hand, the Vedic texts are now widely available in print, and this has lead to a greater dissemination of their knowledge amongst Hindu masses, then say, a century back. Even here however, the popularization largely concerns the spiritual treatises called the Upanishads – the texts par excellence of Hindu spirituality. In fact, for several centuries now, the word ‘Veda’ has been used by Hindu Acharyas to indicate the Upanishadic texts in particular.</p>
<h3 id="2-extent-and-classification-of-the-vedic-literature">2. Extent and Classification of the Vedic Literature</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Vedas are four in number – Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>The traditional perception of the four Vedas may be illustrated with the following verses of Brahmanda Purana -</p>
<p><em>In his (Daksha&rsquo;s) elaborate sacrifice, all the devas had arrived and were present. So also the various ancillaries of the sacrifice. Vashatkara was there in an embodied form. 2.3.1.22</em></p>
<p><em>The Samans and thousands of Yajusha mantras were there in an embodied form. The Rigveda embellished with the Kramapatha also appeared there. 2.3.1.23</em></p>
<p><em>Yajurveda, endowed with chhandas brilliant with Omkara as its mouth was stationed there along with the Suktas (hymns), the Brahmanas and Mantras intermingled with the arthas (objects, purposes) of the Yajna. 2.3.1.24</em></p>
<p><em>Samaveda endowed with the relevant meters and with all the Mantra melodies at their head was present along with Visvavasu and all the other Gandharvas. 2.3.1.25</em></p>
<p><em>The Brahmaveda was present there accompanied with terrible rites. Due to the accompaniment of the Pratyangiras (hymns that nullify the effect of deprecatory verses), it appeared as if it had two bodies and two heads. 2.3.1.26</em></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>According to tradition, each Veda can be divided into two parts – Mantras and Brahmanas. A collection of Mantras is typically called a Samhita. Currently, and often in ancient Hindu tradition as well, it is often the Samhita portion alone which is referred to as the Veda. For instance, the word ‘Rigveda’ would typically mean the Rigveda Samhita.</p>
<p>The Brahmanas have their own names and are more like theological treatises of the Vedas. The end portions of many Brahmanas have an esoteric content, called the ‘Aranyakas’. Embedded in these Aranyakas, or at their very end, are deeply spiritual treatises called the ‘Upanishads’. For several centuries now, Upanishads are the mainstay of Hindu spiritual traditions, and are held in the highest esteem.</p>
<p>In the case of the Rigveda, Samaveda and the Atharvaveda, there is a clear-cut separation of the Mantra collection from the Brahmana portions. In contrast, the Yajurveda is of two types: Shukla (or white) Yajurveda and Krishna (or black) Yajurveda. In the former, the Mantra and Brahmana collections occur separate from each other. In the latter, the Mantra and the Brahmana portions are intermixed. Thus, the Taittiriya ‘Samhita’ belonging to the Krishna Yajurveda has Mantras interspersed with Brahmana portions. Even the Taittiriya ‘Brahmana’ has both Mantras and Brahmana passages mixed with each other.</p>
<p>Coming to the Brahmana texts, there is often no clear-cut distinction between the Brahmanas proper and the Aranyakas, or between the Aranyakas and the Upanishads. The Brahmana text proper often merges into the Aranyakas and many old Upanishads are actually embedded in the Aranyakas.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions even to the above generalizations on the internal distinctions in the Vedic texts.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-mantras">What are Mantras?</h4>
<p>The mantras are basically hymns sung to the Gods - the devotional outpourings of the souls of poets. The Samhitas of the four Vedas are complied for the smooth performance of Vedic sacrifices &lt;sentence a bit odd&gt;. Four types of priests are needed to perform a Vedic sacrifice:</p>
<ol>
<li>The **<em>Hotr</em> **priest who sings hymns to Gods inviting them to preside over the sacrifice,</li>
<li>The <em><strong>Udgaataa</strong></em> priest who sings sweet hymns in musical tones for the entertainment of the Gods,</li>
<li>The <em><strong>Adhvaryu</strong></em> priest who performs the sacrifice according to strict ritualistic code and makes the offering to the Gods and a</li>
<li>The <em><strong>Brahma</strong></em> priest well versed in all the Vedas who supervises the sacrifice.</li>
</ol>
<p>The four Samhitas are said to have been compiled to fulfill the needs of these four main priests: Rk-Samhita for the Hotr, Sama-Samhita for the Udgaataa, Yajurveda Samhita for the Adhvaryu and the Atharvaveda Samhita for the Brahma priest. Initially however, there was no special connection of the Brahma priest with the Atharvaveda, as this Veda was and is not so closely integrated with Vedic ritual as the other three Vedas are.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mantras are basically of 3 major types, when classified according to their mechanical form: Rks, Yajus and Samans. Rks are versified mantras. Yajus are prose mantras whereas Samans are melodies set on Rk.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Rigveda is so called because it is comprised of Rks.</li>
<li>The Yajurveda is so called because it is composed predominantly of prose mantras (yajus) although it has hundreds of Rks as well. However, even the Riks in Yajurveda are recited as if they were prose passages.</li>
<li>The Samaveda Samhita is composed of melodies called Samans, and also the underlying Rks which are set to these melodies.</li>
<li>The Atharvaveda is comprised of Riks (5/6) as well as Yajus (1/6). Some adept Vedic scholars can set even the mantras of Atharvaveda to melodies.</li>
</ol>
<p>In many ways, the Samhita of the Rigveda constitutes the basis of other Samhitas. Not only is it the most ancient Vedic text, it also contributes hundreds of verses to theother Samhitas. Thus, if we consider Samhitas of Rigveda (Sakala), Yajurveda (Madhyandina), Samaveda (Kauthuma) and Atharvaveda (Saunaka), we find that the following number of mantras are repeated:</p>
<p>RV mantras repeated in RV = 140</p>
<p>YV mantras repeated in YV = 120</p>
<p>SV mantras repeated in SV = 2</p>
<p>AV mantras repeated in AV = 230</p>
<p>RV mantras repeated in SV = 1800</p>
<p>RV mantras repeated in YV = 581</p>
<p>RV mantras repeated in AV = 1260</p>
<p>YV mantras repeated in SV = 1</p>
<p>YV mantras repeated in AV = 81</p>
<p>SV mantras repeated in AV = 1</p>
<p>Theoretically, the Mantras have a higher authority than the Brahmanas.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-brahmanas">What are the Brahmanas</h4>
<p>Commenting on Taittiriya Samhita 1.2.1, Bhatta Bhaskara defines ‘Brahmanas’ as texts which expound the Vedic mantras and Yajnas. In chapter 2 of his Kavyamimansa, Rajasekhar defines the Brahmanas as texts which are characterized by statements of eulogy, censure, exposition and (ritual) application (of mantras). The word is used distinctively to denote certain texts for the first time in Taittiriya Samhita 3.7.1.1</p>
<p>Many scholars, modern and ancient, have tried to define the Brahmanas by stating their characteristics. The reality however is that there is no sharp difference in the characteristics of the Mantra and the Brahmana portions of the Vedas. The only thing that we may state safely is this – Mantras are those portions of the Vedas that are designated as such traditionally. And the rest is Brahmana.</p>
<p>Unlike the mantras, which are mostly in verse, the Brahmanas are predominantly prose. The Brahmanas contain formulas for rituals, rules and regulations for rites and sacrifices and also outline other religious duties. The formulas and rules for conducting extremely complex rituals are explained to the minutest detail. And every ritual is performed for a specific purpose for which a specific effect/benefit is expected. It was felt that there was nothing that could not be achieved by sacrifices – the sun could be stopped from rising and Indra, the chief of gods, could be deposed from his throne. The duties of men professing different occupations, the eternity of the Veda, popular customs, cosmogony, historical details, praise of ancient heroes are some other subjects dealt with in the Brahmanas.</p>
<p>The symbolic and spiritual aspects of the sacrificial religion are meditated upon in the Aranyakas while philosophical issues are discussed in the Upanishads. A detailed discussion of Aranyakas and Upanishads is beyond the scope of this webpage.</p>
<p>Attached to the Vedas are several genres of auxiliary texts – the Pratisakhyas, Anukramanis, Siksas, Kalpasutras, Parisishtas etc. A discussion of these texts is beyond the scope of the present webpage.</p>
<h4 id="_3-vedic-shakhas-and-their-geographical-distribution_"><strong><em>3. Vedic Shakhas and their Geographical Distribution</em></strong></h4>
<p>The Vedic literature that has come down to our times is attached to various traditional schools of recitation and ritual called the ‘<em>shakhas</em>’. All the four Vedas have more than one shakha extant. In the past, the number of shakhas studied was many times more.</p>
<p>According to the Mahabhasya of Patanjali, there were 21 shakhas of Rigveda, 9 of Atharvaveda, 101 of Yajurveda (86 of Krishna Yajurveda and 15 of Shukla Yajurveda, according to later authorities) and a 1000 varieties of chanting of Samaveda. Maybe, the number 1000 for the Samaveda merely refers to ‘numerous’. Nevertheless, although only 20 or so Shakhas of the Vedas are extant now, we do possess names of most of the lost Shakhas of the Rigveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. Fragments of many of the lost shakhas are also available as quotations in ancient works. For the Samaveda, we do not have more than 40 names extant.</p>
<p>Two different Vedic shakhas might share one or more texts amongst themselves. Conversely, the distinction between two shakhas of the same Veda might result from the use of a different Samhita text, and/or a different Brahmana text, and/or different Kalpasutra text and so on. For e.g., the Baudhayana and the Apastamba shakhas use the same Taittiriya Brahmana, Taittiriya Samhita and Taittiriya Aranyaka but follow different Kalpasutras. On the other hand, the Shankhayana and the Kaushitaka shakhas use the same Samhita and Shrauta Sutra but their Brahmanas have slightly different readings and their Grhyasutras are quite different.</p>
<p>A group or a community of people who study a particular shakha in its entirety (Samhita + Brahmana + Aranyaka + Kalpasutra + any additional texts) and perform its ritual constitute a ‘<em>charana</em>’. For instance, Brahmins who study the Taittiriya Samhita/Brahmana/Aranyaka together with the Kalpasutra of Apastamba say - “I follow the Apastamba charana’.</p>
<p>In certain cases, we have instances of ‘mixed shakhas’. For instance, the followers of Shakala shakha have adopted the Kalpasutra of Ashvalayana. The Ashvalayana shakha, which had the now well-known Ashvalayana Sutra, has in turn lost oral traditions of its Samhita. Likewise, the Kaushitakins of Kerala often use the Samhita of Shakalas.</p>
<p>The various shakhas of the Vedas were, at one time, spread throughout South Asia. Their geographical location has not been constant down the ages, as communities of Brahmins professing a particular shakha migrated from one part of India to the other, or adopted another shakha when it became impossible for them to sustain the tradition of their own shakhas.</p>
<p>It is quite certain however, that the tradition of recitation of the Vedic texts originated in north India, and this region was the area where almost all the shakhas originally arose. From various sources, we can determine the following geographical distribution of Vedic Shakhas at various intervals of times, and their present state of survival :-</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Shakala RV</strong></em>: Thrives in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu and to some extent in Uttar Pradesh. Might have existed in Punjab. Nambudiris of Kerala recite even the Brahmana and Aranyaka with accents. Accented manuscripts of Brahmana and Aranyaka are available to this day.</li>
<li><em><strong>Shankhayana Rigveda</strong></em>: Gujarat and parts of Rajasthan and Maharashtra. Oral tradition extinct, only manuscripts of Samhita are extant. Ritual lives in a very fragmentary condition</li>
<li><em><strong>Bashkala RV</strong></em>: Claims have been made about its existence in Kerala, Rajasthan, Bengal and Assam as a living tradition, but have never been verified. The Samhita exists in manuscript. Nambudiris of Kerala are said to follow this Shakha of RV as far as the Samhita is concerned but studies of their oral tradition do not seem to bear this out.</li>
<li><em><strong>Ashvalayana RV</strong></em>: Manuscripts of the Samhita have been found in Kashmir, Maharashtra (Ahmadnagar) and Patna (Bihar). In parts of central and eastern India, Shakala RV texts are often attributed to Ashvalayana. For instance, the Aitareya Brahman is often called Ashvalayana Brahmana in West Bengal. Oral traditions extinct although the followers of Shakala Shakha in Maharashtra often term themselves as Ashvalayanas because they follow the Kalpasutra (Shrautasutra + Grhyasutra) of Ashvalayana.</li>
<li><em><strong>Paingi RV</strong></em>: Exited in Tamil Nadu, in and around Andavan. Oral traditions lost but Brahmana texts rumored to exist.</li>
<li><em><strong>Mandukeya RV</strong></em>: Magadha and eastern and central Uttar Pradesh. Possibly lower Himalayas in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. No text or oral tradition extant although the Brhaddevata and Rigvidhana might belong to it.</li>
<li><em><strong>Shaunakiya AV</strong></em>: Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Avadh region in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh. Only Gujarat has maintained the oral traditions, and the shakha has been resuscitated in recent times in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and in Andhra Pradesh.</li>
<li><em><strong>Staudayana AV</strong></em>: According to Majjhima Nikaya, followers of this shakha lived in Koshala (central and eastern Uttar Pradesh). The shakha is completely lost.</li>
<li><em><strong>Paippalada AV</strong></em>: Followers are currently found in parts of Orissa and adjacent areas of Bihar and West Bengal and recite the Samhita in <em>ekasruti</em> (monotone syllable). Epigraphic and literary evidence shows that they once thrived in Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and parts of Gujarat, East Bengal and in Tamil Nadu as well.</li>
<li><em><strong>Devadarshi AV</strong></em>: According to literary evidence, followers of this Shakha once lived in coastal Andhra Pradesh. Other AV shakhas said to have been prevalent in that region were Shaulkayani and Munjakeshi. The shakha is completely lost.</li>
<li><em><strong>Charanavaidya</strong></em> and <em><strong>Jajala AV</strong></em>: Perhaps existed in Gujarat, Central India and adjacent parts of Rajasthan. According to the Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas, the Samhita of the Charanavaidya shakha had 6026 mantras.</li>
<li><em><strong>Mauda AV</strong></em>: According to some scholars, they existed in Kashmir</li>
<li><em><strong>Madhyandina YV:</strong></em> Currently found all over North India- Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and even Maharashtra (up to Nashik), West Bengal, Assam, Nepal. Along with Taittiriya Yajurveda, it is the most prevalent Vedic shakha. Followers of this school were found in Sindh (Pakistan) in the 19<sup>th</sup> century but became extinct after Hindus were ethnically cleansed by the Muslim majority after 1947.</li>
<li><em><strong>Kanva YV</strong></em>: Currently found in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. In Orissa, the followers of this shakha follow a slightly different text. Epigraphic evidence shows that they were once present all over India, as far as Himachal Pradesh and possibly in Nepal.</li>
<li><em><strong>Charaka YV</strong></em>: Interior Maharashtra, adjacent parts of Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh. Followers of this shakha now follow the Maitrayani YV shakha, having lost their own texts.</li>
<li><em><strong>Maitrayani YV</strong></em>: In Morvi (Gujarat), parts of Maharashtra (Naskik/Bhadgaon, Nandurbar, Dhule). Earlier, they were spread all the way east up to Allahabad and extended into Rajasthan and possibly into Sindh.</li>
<li><em><strong>Kathaka YV</strong></em>: The oral traditions became extinct possibly a few decades ago. They were found in central and eastern Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, possibly west Punjab and NWFP. In later times, they got restricted to Kashmir, where all their extant manuscripts have been unearthed. Recently, the entire Hindu minority was cleansed from the Kashmir valley by Islamists, and so the shakha might be deemed extinct completely now.</li>
<li><em><strong>Charayaniya Katha YV</strong></em>: Existed in Kashmir.</li>
<li><em><strong>Kapisthala Katha</strong></em> <em><strong>YV</strong></em>: Found in West Punjab around the time of the invasion of Alexander. Also in parts of Gujarat. Only a fragmentary Samhita and Grhyasutra text exist, and followers of this shakha are said to exist at the mouths of Narmada and Tapi rivers in Gujarat.</li>
<li><em><strong>Jabala YV</strong></em>: Central India, around the Narmada region. In Maharashtra, there still exist Shukla-Yajurvedin Brahmins who call themselves ‘Jabala Brahmins’, but there is no knowledge of the existence of any texts of this shakha.</li>
<li><em><strong>Taittiriya YV</strong></em>: Buddhist texts and some versions of Ramayana attest their presence in the Gangetic plains but currently they are found all over Southern India. The Taittiriyas are themselves divided into numerous sub-schools. Among these, the followers of Baudhayana and Apastamba were found all over South India (including Maharashtra), while the Hiranyakeshins were found mainly in Konkan and Western Maharashtra. The Vaikhanasas have a more eastern presence- around Tirupati and Chennai. The Vadhulas are present currently in Kerala and earlier in adjacent parts of Tamil Nadu. The Agniveshyas, a subdivision of the Vadhula immigrants from Malabar, are found around Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu. The Apastamba, Hiranyakeshin, Vaikhanasa and Baudhayana schools have survived with all their texts intact. The Vadhulas survive, with most of their texts while the Bharadvajas and Agniveshyas are practically extinct as a living tradition although their fragmentary/dilapidated texts survive.</li>
<li><em><strong>Kauthuma SV</strong></em>: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu (tradition revived with the help of Brahmins from Poona), Kerala, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar (tradition revived a century ago), West Bengal (tradition has been revived recently). There are numerous varieties of Kauthuma chanting. This shakha is the most vibrant tradition of Samaveda.</li>
<li><em><strong>Ranayaniya SV</strong></em>: Orissa (manuscripts available, status of oral tradition not known), Maharashtra, Karnataka (the Havyak &lt;you mean havik?&gt; community for instance), Uttar Pradesh (till recently in Bahraich and Mathura), Rajasthan (till recently in Jaipur). The existence of this shakha was endangered till recently, but it has been strengthened with the help of institutions like the Kanchi Kamakoti Matha.</li>
<li><em><strong>Jaiminiya/Talavakara SV</strong></em>: Two distinct sub streams- the Namudiri recitations in Central Kerala, and the recitations of Tamil Nadu Brahmins in districts adjacent to Kerala and in and around Srirangam. The survival of these schools is endangered.</li>
<li><em><strong>Shatyayaniya SV</strong></em>: Said to have been prevalent in Tamil Nadu and parts of North India. The shakha is no longer extant.</li>
<li><em><strong>Gautama SV</strong></em>: Said to have been prevalent in Tamil Nadu and in Andhra Pradesh till the 17<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E. Many followers of the Kauthuma school in Andhra Pradesh still call themselves ‘Gautamas’.</li>
<li><em><strong>Bhallavi SV</strong></em>: Said to have been prevalent in Karnataka and parts of North India</li>
<li><em><strong>Other Shakhas of YV</strong></em>: A text called ‘Yajurvedavriksha’ gives the geographical distribution of more than 100 Shakhas of Yajurveda. This description is being left out for brevity.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-extant-vedic-texts">4. Extant Vedic Texts</h3>
<p>The Vedic texts were traditionally transmitted orally (or at least predominantly without the aid of manuscripts, which might have been used sparingly as memory aids). This was essential because the texts were ‘accented’, or in other words the different words or letters therein were recited according to different pitch/tones. Very elaborate mnemonic devices were developed to preserve the texts with great fidelity, and harsh divine vengeance and evil repercussions were promised to those who deformed or mutilated the text in any manner. As a result, several Vedic texts were indeed transmitted over several millennia with utmost fidelity, together with accent. The texts that are used for aiding the memorization and recitation of the Vedas with utmost fidelity, are called ‘Lakshana Granthas’. These texts include Padapathas, Ghanapathas, Kramapatha and other Vikrtis or modifications of the root text, phonetic treatises like Sikshas and Pratisakhyas and so on.</p>
<p>In some cases however, the accents were lost with time and the texts had to be recited without the Vedic accents. For instance, the Brahmanas of the Samaveda lost their accents even as early as the time of Kumarila Bhatta (7<sup>th</sup> century C.E.). Similarly, the Paippalada Samhita is recited by its followers today without the Vedic accents (i.e., in <em>ekasruti</em>). In the case of the Madhyandina Samhita, the oral intonations are not related to the accent of the written text. The table below lists only the texts that exist (in print or manuscript) OR are rumored to exist in manuscript. The various cells describe whether the printed editions or manuscripts are available or not, and whether the oral traditions are extant or not. The symbol ‘X’ indicates that no information is available.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that the Vedic literature was several times its current extent, and most Vedic texts are lost. The extant literature however is a good and a comprehensive representative of the overall corpus.</p>

<h3 id="6-contents-of-samhitas-and-brahmanas-a-brief-survey">6. Contents of Samhitas and Brahmanas: A Brief Survey</h3>
<h4 id="1-the-rigveda-samhita">1. The Rigveda Samhita</h4>
<p>This is the oldest Vedic text, as also the largest. It comprises of 10552 mantras in 1028 hymns (=Suktas). The hymns are divided amongst 10 books called the ‘mandalas’. Mandala 9 has 114 hymns address to Soma. Mandalas 1 and 10 are considered later additions, for most part.</p>
<p>The Rigveda Samhita is often also divided into 8 parts called ‘Ashtakas’ which are further divided into 8 chapters each. Thus, there are 64 chapters according to this classification, which is later than the Mandala scheme.</p>
<p>On the whole, the Rigveda mostly consists of hymns to be sung to the various gods as manifestations of the One Divinity. Varuna, Mitra, Surya, Savitr, Vishnu, Pusan, the Ashvin twins, Agni, Soma, Yama, Parjanya, Indra, Maruts, Rudra, Vishvakarman, Prajapati, MAtarishvan, Ushas, Aditi are some of the Gods encountered in the Rg Veda. Varuna - the god of the sky, Indra - the god of war &lt;that is rather limited description!&gt; and Agni - the god of fire, are more popular than Vishnu and Rudra (Shiva). Surya, Savitr and Pusan all refer to the solar deity and the Gayatri mantra is addressed to Savitr. Ushas and Aditi are goddesses. Almost a quarter of hymns each are addressed to Agni and to Indra. Mandala X has several hymns pertaining to more popular topics, to spiritual topics, cosmogony and other miscellaneous matter.</p>
<p>The hymns are altogether attributed to 407 Rishis, or Sages, of which 21 are women Sages ( = Rishika). The Sages belong, in general, to 10 families, each of which has a special hymn (=Apri Sukta) associated with them. Mandalas 2-8 are family mandalas since each of these mandalas contains hymns predominantly from 1 major family of Vedic seers. These families subsequently gave rise to most of the Brahmin communities of the Hindu society. Mandala 2 is associated with Grtsamadas, Mandala 3 is associated with Vishvamitra and his lineage, 4 with Vamadeva and related Rishis, 5 with Atris, 6 with Bharadvajas, 7 with Vasisthas. Mandala 8 has numerous hymns by Kanvas while Mandala 9 has several hymns by Kashyapa Rishis.</p>
<p>The mantras are composed in 7 major and dozens of minor prosodic meters.</p>
<h4 id="2-yajurveda-samhitas">2. Yajurveda Samhitas</h4>
<p>As stated earlier, the Yajurveda has two main divisions – Shukla Yajurveda and Krishna Yajurveda. In the former, the mantra and Brahmana portions are collected in separate texts, whereas in the later, the two portions are found interspersed.</p>
<p>The extant Shukla Yajurveda Samhitas are Madhyandina and Kanva.</p>
<p>The extant Krishna Yajurveda Samhitas are Kathaka, Maitrayaniya, Taittiriya (also called ‘Apastambi’ Samhita), Kapishthala (fragmentary) and possibly Charaka.</p>
<p>Of the extant Yajurveda Samhitas, the two major ones currently are the Madhyandina and the Taittiriya.</p>
<p>The great sage Yajnavalkya is said to have collected and edited the Ur-Shukla Yajurveda Samhita, called the Vajasneyi Samhita. The Madhyandina Samhita comprises of 1975 kandikas or 3988 mantras (the prose kandikas are split up into several mantras) arranged into 40 chapters according to the order of performance of Vedic sacrifices. All but the last chapter (which is called the Ishavasya Upanishad) are employed in the Vedic ritual. The Yajurveda is largely prose, with about 700 verse mantras, most of which are directly borrowed from the Rigveda. The Yajurveda therefore is a liturgical text, but also contains sacrificial formulas to serve the purpose of ceremonial religion (yaju is derived from the root “yag” – to sacrifice). Coming to the Madhyandina Samhita specifically,</p>
<ol>
<li>Chapters 1-2 deal with Darsapurnamasa rites,</li>
<li>Chapter 3 with sacrifices performed in the morning and the evenings, sacrifices performed every four months at the start of the three seasons</li>
<li>Chapters 4-8 with Soma sacrifices</li>
<li>Chapters 9-10 with Rajasuya and Vajapeya</li>
<li>Chapters 11-18 with construction of altars for yajnas</li>
<li>Chapters 19-31 with Sautramani rite</li>
<li>Chapters 22-25 with the Ashvamedha</li>
<li>Chapters 26-29 give material supplementary to earlier chapters</li>
<li>Chapters 30-39 contain mantras for novel and unique rites like the Purushamedha, Sarvamedha, Pitrmedha and Pravargya</li>
<li>Chapter 40 is the Isavasya Upanishad</li>
</ol>
<p>Very popular in South India, the Taittiriya Samhita deals with detailed descriptions of sacrifices like Agnishtoma, Jyotishtoma, Vajapeya, Rajasuya, etc It is divided into 7 kandas which are further divided into 5-8 Prapathakas each. The Taittiriya Brahmana, the Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Taittiriya Upanishad are associated with this Samhita. In the Yajur Veda, Vishnu becomes more important. Shiva is also mentioned. Prajapati, the creator of the world, is identified with Vishvakarman. Brahman comes to signify the creative principle of the world. In general, the contents of this Samhita parallel the Shukla Yajurveda Samhitas although exotic and special rites like the Purushamedha are absent here.</p>
<h4 id="3-the-samaveda-samhitas-and-melodies">3. The Samaveda Samhitas and Melodies</h4>
<p>It is purely a liturgical collection that comprises of 1875 Rks, of which all but 75 Rks are traceable to the published Shakalya Samhita of the Rigveda. The rest are all said to occur in the Shankhayana Samhita of the Rigveda. All these verses are set to melodies, called the Samans. The origins of Indian classical music lies in the Sama Veda.</p>
<p>The Samhita is divided into two broad divisions- <em>Purvarchika</em>, on which the <em>Gramageya</em> and the <em>Aranyaka</em> samans are set, and the <em>Uttararchika</em>, on which the <em>Uha</em> and the <em>Uhya</em> chants are set. The ganas (=samans) of Gramageya and Aranyageya form the basic collection called the Prakritigana or the archetypes of ganas, to which the Uttaragana based on the Uttararchika is adapted. The marked difference between the melodies of Purvarchika and Uttararchika is that the former is constituted on a single verse basis while the latter on units of three verses. The Uttaragana is divided into two sections known as the Uha and the Uhya or Rahasya: the first is adapted to the Gramageya while the second to Aranyageya. Thus the Uttaragana closely follows the Purvagana in its structure, divisions and notations including the melodic notes. While Purvagana forms part of the Swadhyaya or daily recitations, like the Samhitas, which are considered to be apaurusheya, meaning thereby that they were not composed by the Rishis but revealed to them by Brahma, whereas the Uttaragana was believed to have been composed by the acharyas for liturgical purposes by adapting them to the Purvagana. Hence, they are called Uhaganas, adapted melodies. The Uha and Uhya ganas of Uttararchika are divided into seven divisions namely Dasharatra, Samvatsara, Ekaha, Ahina, Sattra, Kshudra and Prayaschitta, clearly indicating the class of sacrifices at which they are generally executed.</p>
<p>The Ranayaniya Samhita is not published yet but appears to be materially identical to the Kauthuma Sahmita, although its Samans are quite different.</p>
<p>The root text of the Jaiminiyas, on which their melodies are based, is the Jaiminiya Archika Samhita. This text runs parellel to the Kauthuma Samhita of Samaveda, available in easily accessible editions. The Samhita has approximately 1650 mantras and its Saman tradition is quite different from the main Kauthuma tradition.  The Jaiminiya chants can be subdivided into 3 variations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Nambudiri chants,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanjavur/Thiruchi districts in Tamil Nadu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tirunalveli district and the area close to Palaghat (Kerala) in Tamil    Nadu</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="4-atharvaveda-samhita">4. Atharvaveda Samhita</h4>
<p>It is often said that the Atharva Angirasa was originally not given the status of a Veda, but seems to have been later elevated to the position. The main theme of the Atharva Veda is cure for diseases, rites for prolonging life and fulfillment of one’s desires, statecraft, penances, magic, charms, spells and sorcery. While the Gods of the Rg Veda are approached with love, the Gods of the Atharva Veda are approached with cringing fear and favor is curried to ward off their wrath. Homage is paid to them to abstain from doing harm. Sophisticated literary style and high metaphysical ideas mark this Veda. The two extant Samhitas of Atharvaveda are Shaunakiya and Paippalada.</p>
<p>The former has 5977 mantras arranged in 20 books called ‘kandas’ while the latter has approximately 7950 mantras arranged in as many kandas.</p>
<p>This Veda offers a better insight into the actual culture and life of the Vedic society, because of its significant ‘popular’ content – hymns connected with wedding, agriculture, battle, medicine, domestic ceremonies, coronation and so on. Significantly, dozens of hymns are also devoted to Hindu spirituality, and are often at par with the Upanishads.</p>
<p>The Atharvaveda has numerous names –</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Bhrgvangirasa Veda</em> – because of association with Bhrigus and Angirases</li>
<li><em>Atharvangirasa Veda</em> – Because of association with Atharvana and Angirasa priests, and because of a dual nature (sorcery as well as ‘shanti-pushti’ rites)</li>
<li><em>Kshatraveda</em> – because it has several hymns dealing with war, rites of coronation and so on.</li>
<li>*Brahmaveda *– because it has several hymns dealing with spirituality</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="5-aitareya-brahmana-of-rigveda">5. Aitareya Brahmana of Rigveda</h4>
<p>This Brahmana is common to the Shakala and Ashvalayana shakhas of Rigveda. It comprises of 8 groups (called ‘Panchikas’) of 5 chapters each. Hence, the text comprises of 40 chapters. Of these, the first 30 are presumably the composition of Rishi Mahidasa Aitareya, whereas the last 10 chapters were added by Rishi Shaunaka. The main contents of this text are as follows –</p>
<ol>
<li>Chapters 1-13 deal with the duties of the Hotr priest in the Agnishtoma sacrifice</li>
<li>Chapter 14 deals with the meaning of the word ‘Agnishtoma’ and sundry matters</li>
<li>Chapters 15-17 describe the Ukthya, Shodasha, Atiratra and other sacrifices</li>
<li>Chapter 18 contains rules for the Hotr priest</li>
<li>Chapters 19-24 discuss the duties of the Hotr priest at the twelve minor sacrifices</li>
<li>Chapters 25 deals with sundry matters – expiations needed to be performed by the sacrificer, appropriate times of performing the Agnishtoma, duties of Brahma priest</li>
<li>Chapters 26-30 deal with the duties of the Gravastuta, Subrahmanya and 6 other minor priests involved in the Soma sacrifices</li>
<li>Chapters 31-40 deal with the sacrifices performed by the Kshatriyas (e.g. Vajapeya and Rajasuya) and the mutual relationships of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="6-shankhayana-brahmana-of-rigveda">6. Shankhayana Brahmana of Rigveda</h4>
<p>This Brahmana text comprises of 30 chapters and is still studied in Gujarat and parts of Maharashtra. Its contents run parallel to the Aitareya Brahmanam but its arrangement is more systematic.</p>
<h4 id="7-kausitaki-brahmana-of-rigveda">7. Kausitaki Brahmana of Rigveda</h4>
<p>This text differs from the Shankhayana Brahmana only in a few words and syllables here and there. The other difference is that in this Brahmana, even the sentences are enumerated. It is prevalent only in Kerala, where it is recited orally. Portions of the text are recited with accents.</p>
<h4 id="8-kanva-and-madhyandina-shatapatha-brahmanas-of-the-shukla-yajurveda">8. Kanva and Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmanas of the Shukla Yajurveda</h4>
<p>The Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmana (SBM) is divided into 14 Kandas containing 100 adhyayas, 68 prapathakas, 436 Brahmanas and 7179 Kandikas</p>
<p>The Kanva (SBK) text is divided into 17 Kandas, 104 adhyayas, 435 Brahmanas and 6806 Kandikas. Note that unlike the Madhyandina version, there is no division into Prapathakas.</p>

<p>The Shatapatha Brahmana is perhaps the most important Brahmana text from the perspective of Vedic studies.</p>
<h4 id="9-taittiriya-brahmana-of-krishna-yajurveda">9. Taittiriya Brahmana of Krishna Yajurveda</h4>
<p>The Brahmana comprises of 3 kandas, which are divided into 8, 8 and 12 adhyayas respectively. The Brahmana is also sometimes divided into 8 ashtakas, in the style of Rigveda. These adhyayas are further divided into anuvakas or sections, which contain sentences on a particular topic. There are a total of 17480 sentences in the Brahmana. The first kanda of the text deals with the Agnyadhana, Gavamayana, Vajapeya, Soma, Nakshatreshti and Rajasuya. The 2<sup>nd</sup> kanda deals with Agnihotra, Upahomas, Sautramani, Vaisysava and others. The last kanda gives some additional details on the Nakshatreshti, the Ashvamedha and some parables like that of Bharadvaja, together with the Purushamedha Yajna.</p>
<h4 id="10-vadhula-brahmana-or-the-anvakhyana-brahmana-of-krishna-yajurveda">10. Vadhula Brahmana or the Anvakhyana Brahmana of Krishna Yajurveda</h4>
<p>It is an anu-brahmana or a minor Brahmana like work, embedded in the Vadhula Shrautasutra. The work has not been published so far and is in manuscript.</p>
<h4 id="11-panchavimsa-brahmana-of-samaveda">11. Panchavimsa Brahmana of Samaveda</h4>
<p>This text derives its name from the fact that it has 25 chapters called Prapathakas, which are further subdivided into 347 sections called ‘khandas’. It is also called the ‘Tandya Mahabrahmana’ and is the principal Brahmana text of the Kauthuma and the Ranayaniya schools. This Brahmana deals with the employment of various Samans in different Vedic rituals, discusses Soma sacrifices in detail, and narrates legends about various Sages to whom different Samans were revealed. The contents of the Brahmana are as follows –</p>
<ol>
<li>Prapathaka I : Collection of Yajus</li>
<li>Prapathakas II-III : Vistutis</li>
<li>Prapathaka IV –IX.2 : Various rites (Jyotishtoma, Ukthya, Atiratra, Prakrtis of ekahas and ahinas)</li>
<li>Prapathaka IX.3 – IX.10 : Somaprayaschittas</li>
<li>Prapathaka X – XV : Dvadashaha rite</li>
<li>Prapathaka XVI – XIX : One day rites</li>
<li>Prapathaka XX – XXII: Ahina rites</li>
<li>Prapathaka XXIII – XXV : Longer rites i.e., the Sattras</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="12-shadavimsa-brahmana-of-samaveda">12. Shadavimsa Brahmana of Samaveda</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, it is an appendix to the Panchavimsa Brahmana, forming its 26<sup>th</sup> chapter as it were. The text deals with the Subrahmanya litanies and with one-day abhichara (sorcery) rites. This is a short text comprising 5 sections.</p>
<h4 id="13-samavidhana-brahmana-of-samaveda">13. Samavidhana Brahmana of Samaveda</h4>
<p>This text comprises of 3 prapathakas. It deals with the recitation of Samans with a view of obtaining specific fruit/results. It is paralleled in the Rigveda tradition by a text called Shaunakiya Rigvidhana, and in the Yajurveda tradition by Katyayaniya Yajurvidhana.</p>
<h4 id="14-arsheya-brahmana-of-samaveda">14. Arsheya Brahmana of Samaveda</h4>
<p>The text is merely a kind of an Arshanukramani, or an index of Sages connected with the Gramageya and Aranya Samans. A particular Saman might have more than one Rishi or Sage associated with it, and these might be different from the Sage linked to the underlying Rk on which the Saman is sung. It is divided into 3 Prapathakas.</p>
<h4 id="15-devatadhyaya-brahmana">15. Devatadhyaya Brahmana</h4>
<p>It lays down the criterion for deciding the deity of the Samaganas.</p>
<h4 id="16-chhandogya-brahmana">16. Chhandogya Brahmana</h4>
<p>The Chhandogya Brahmana is a work of ten divisions called ‘Prapathakas’ and comprises of two parts –</p>
<ol>
<li>Prapathakas 1-2 form the Mantra Brahmana or the Mantra Parvan and contain mantras used in Grhya rites.</li>
<li>Prapathakas 3-10 constitute the famous Chhandogya Upanishad.</li>
</ol>
<p>Coming to the Mantra Brahmana, each of the two Prapathakas is further subdivided into eight khandas, or sections. The entire text has 268 mantras, including the 11 additional formulae noted in the most ancient extant commentary by Gunavishnu. These mantras are pre-supposed by the Grhyasutras of Khadira and Gobhila, which prescribe them for various Grhya rites. In fact, the order of the mantras on the Mantra Brahmana parallels the corresponding rites in the Grhyasutras, in the same order. It is as if the Grhyasutras and the Mantra Brahmana complement each other.</p>
<p>A discussion of the Chhandogya Upanishad is beyond the scope of the present webpage.</p>
<h4 id="17-samhitopanishad-brahmana">17. Samhitopanishad Brahmana</h4>
<p>This text deals with the ‘secret’ aspect of the Samhitas. The collections of verses are grouped together for various purposes. It emphasizes the responsibilities of the great tradition of the Samaveda and the correct doctrine reflected therein, through the chosen line of disciples. It also discusses the fee that ought to be given to one’s religious teachers.</p>
<h4 id="18-vamsa-brahmana">18. Vamsa Brahmana</h4>
<p>This is a very short Brahmana, containing lists of ancient Samavedic teachers.</p>
<h4 id="19-jaiminiya-brahmana">19. Jaiminiya Brahmana</h4>
<p>After the Shatapatha Brahmana, this is perhaps the second most important Brahmanas because it is a fairly long text and because it is a storehouse of several Vedic legends and stories. The text is divided into three main divisions called the ‘kandas’. The main ritual sections of the text are – Agnihotra (1.1-1.65), Agnishtoma (1.65-1.364); Gavaayamaana (2.1-80); Ekaahas (2.81-234) or one day Soma sacrifices; Ahinas or sacrifices lasting upto 12 days (2.235-333); Sattras or longer sacrifices (2.334-370); Gavaayamaana (2.371-442), Dvadashaaha (kanda 3). The last kanda has very interesting geographical and historical information. The text as printed has several unclear words. Although it runs parallel to the Tandya Mahabrahmana, it is more detailed in its treatment than the latter. The other two Brahmanas of the Jaiminiya shakha are the Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana and the Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana.</p>
<h4 id="20-jaiminiya-arsheya-brahmana">20. Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana</h4>
<p>Its contents are similar to the Arsheya Brahmana of the Kauthuma shakha, but the specific names of the two texts differ a lot. This text names only 1 Sage per Saman, while the Kauthuma Arsheya Brahmana often lists more than one Sage.</p>
<h4 id="21-gopatha-brahmana">21. Gopatha Brahmana</h4>
<p>This is the only extant Brahmana of the Atharvaveda. It is divided into two major parts – Purvabhaaga and Uttarabhaaga. These in turn are altogether divided into 11 sections called ‘Prapathakas’. The Purvabhaga of the Gopatha Brahman exhibits more originality of content in that it glorifies the Athavan and its priests. In contrast, the Uttarabhaga follows the other Brahmanas in its content, although it introduces legends related to other Atharvan teachers. Embedded in the Gopatha Brahmana are Upanishad texts like the Pranava Upanishad. According to the Atharvana Charanavyuha, the text originally had 100 Prapathakas and was therefore much larger in extent.  Significantly, Gopatha Brahmana 1.1.29 quotes Vyasa to the effect that he who knows the Atharvaveda knows all.</p>
<h4 id="22-aitareya-aranyaka">22. Aitareya Aranyaka</h4>
<p>It comprises of 5 Aranyakas further divided into 18 chapters. The first three Aranyakas are ascribed to Mahidasa Aitareya, the 4<sup>th</sup> is merely a collection of Mahanamni verses, and the fifth Aranyaka is attributed to Ashvalayana (or sometimes, to Rishi Shaunaka).</p>
<ol>
<li>Aranyaka I deals with  with the Mahavratas of the fundamental duties, and with Saman-stotras meant to be sung on particular days.</li>
<li>Aranyaka II.1-3 explain the meaning of ‘uktha’ while Aranyaka II.4-6 are the famous Aitareya Upanishad.</li>
<li>Aranyaka III is a ‘Samhita Upanishad’, i.e., it treats the Rigveda Samhita and its various mnemonic forms as objects of meditation and reflection. Numerous Vedic Sages are mentioned in this section.</li>
<li>Aranyaka IV is merely a collection of Mahanamni verses.</li>
<li>Aranyaka V is like a Sutra text, and deals mainly with the Nishkevalya shastra that is recited during the afternoon ceremony portion of the Mahavrata rite.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="23-shankhayana-aranyaka">23. Shankhayana Aranyaka</h4>
<p>The text is divided into 15 chapters, and its contents are similar to the Aitareya Aranyaka. The famous Kaushitaki Upanishad is embedded in this text as sections III-VI.1-4. The first two chapters resemble Brahmanas, and the last chapter is often considered a later addition.</p>
<h4 id="24-taittiriya-aranyaka">24. Taittiriya Aranyaka</h4>
<p>This work comprises of 10 Prapathakas. The first two are called ‘Kathakam’ because they are said to have been borrowed from the Kathaka shakha of Yajurveda.</p>
<p>Prapathaka 5 deals with the Pravargya rite.</p>
<p>Prapathakas 7-9 are the famous Taittiriya Upanishad.</p>
<p>Prapathaka 10 is the Mahanarayana Upanishad, or the Yajnika Upanishad. This Prapathaka is often considered an appendix because its extent and contents are unsettled and vary from region to region. It is a compilation of Upanishadic matter together with miscellaneous mantras for recitation at various occasions and for various purposes.</p>
<h4 id="25-brihadaranyaka-of-shukla-yajurveda">25. Brihadaranyaka of Shukla Yajurveda</h4>
<p>This text forms the 17<sup>th</sup> book of the Kanva Shatapatha Brahmana, and the 14<sup>th</sup> book of the Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmana. The initial 2 Prapathakas in the Madhyandina version deal with the Pravargya rite, and the last 6 constitute the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, whose details are beyond the scope of this webpage. In the Kanva version, the Pravargya portions are present separately as kanda XVI.</p>
<h4 id="26-maitrayaniya-aranyaka">26. Maitrayaniya Aranyaka</h4>
<p>Since this text is identical with the Maitrayaniya Upanishad in 7 Prapathakas, its discussion is beyond the scope of the present webpage.</p>
<h4 id="27-katha-aranyaka">27. Katha Aranyaka</h4>
<p>It comprises of 3 Prapathakas, of which II and III largely deal with the Pravargya rite.</p>
<h4 id="28-jaiminiya-upanishad-brahmana">28. Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana</h4>
<p>This text is also known as the Talavakara Aranyaka and is the only extant Aranyaka of Samaveda. In the introduction to his commentary on the Kena Upanishad, Shankaracharya states that the Upanishad forms the beginning of the 9<sup>th</sup> chapter of Brahmana of that Sakha. In the extant manuscripts, the Kena Upanishad forms the 10<sup>th</sup> Anuvaka of the Upanishad Brahmana section, which occurs in the 4<sup>th</sup> Adhyaya of the Jaiminiya Brahmana proper. The JUB is then followed by the Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana. This Aranyaka deals with the esoteric meanings of various Samans, and also deals with concepts that are later found in Tantric Hinduism. It also gives spiritual interpretations of several Rigvedic mantras.</p>
<h3 id="f-age-of-the-samhitas-and-the-brahmanas">F. Age of the Samhitas and the Brahmanas</h3>
<p>It is difficult to date the various Samhitas and Brahmanas of the Veda very precisely because of the following reasons –</p>
<ol>
<li>First, they are primarily liturgical, ritualistic and spiritual texts. Hence, any information on the material aspects of the culture that they belonged to, would be incidental.</li>
<li>Second, they were composed and transmitted by very elitist classes of Brahmin priests and therefore are not representative of the culture and civilizations of the periods to which they belong. This makes it difficult to correlate them with archaeological data.</li>
<li>Third, they appeared to have been written and compiled predominantly in modern Indian states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and therefore, any corroborating information from other parts of India would be of limited utility.</li>
<li>Fourth, the texts, as available today, are quite heterogeneous and layered and it is often difficult to separate the layers chronologically.</li>
<li>Fifth, we are still in the dark about the precise chronological and cultural relationship between the archaeologically dated Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and the culture pre-supposed by the Vedic texts.</li>
<li>Sixth, we do not know precisely the extent of transformation (in terms of content and language) that these texts underwent before they were finally frozen into their present forms. Thus, while the present forms of these texts might be dated on the basis of principles of Historical Linguistics, we would still not know when the Ur-texts were composed.</li>
<li>Seven, the extant Vedic texts are a fraction of the original literature and it is known that at least some of the lost texts showed different linguistic features. Therefore, any conclusions drawn on the basis of linguistic studies could only be provisional.</li>
<li>And last, the script of the IVC still remains un-deciphered. Most of the earlier failures of attempts (more than 50) were probably due to the unjustified assumption that the script represented a ‘proto-Dravidian’ language.</li>
</ol>
<p>The whole issue has become extremely vitiated because of heavy politicization, and because the earlier chronologies proposed for these texts were often inspired by white supremacist views and Christian missionary biases.</p>
<p>The conventional views, first proposed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by Western Indologists, who were often (but not always) constrained by Biblical biases (“the world was created in 4004 BCE”) or influenced by the ‘<em>white man’s burden</em>’ mindset, were that the Rigveda was composed around 1200 BCE. The Rigveda was then said to have been followed chronologically by all the other Vedic texts. The emerging studies of Comparative Linguistics and Philology, and the myth of the Aryan Invasion Theory were made to lend further credence to these views.</p>
<p>With the discovery of a pre 1500 BCE civilization in the Indus basin (and subsequently in Gujarat and as far east as the Ganges and as far south as the Godavari river) it was assumed that this newly found civilization was non-Vedic. The composers of the Vedas were then said to have destroyed the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) with the help of horses and chariots and iron weapons (later on) and pushed the original inhabitants of the IVC area into peninsular India. This is called the <em><strong>Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT)</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The theory further states that the Vedic people (called Aryans) were fair and tall like Nordic Europeans, in contrast to the inhabitants of the IVC area, who were presumably short and dark. The verses of Rigveda were twisted to see massacres of these dark ‘Dasyus’ perpetrated by the invading white Aryans, as a result of which the Dasyus then fled to south. The Aryans were said to have invaded in several massive waves, so much so that they came to dominate modern Pakistan, northern India and Afghanistan completely in a few centuries, and obliterated all the traces of a non-Aryan past. The descendants of the Dasyus, who were supposedly pushed to South India, were equated with modern Dravidian speakers and even certain words said to be ‘borrowed’ from Dravidian languages were found in the Rigveda, despite the fact that the earliest literature in any Dravidian language (Tamil to be specific) post-dates Rigveda by atleast 1200 years. The AIT was also initially promoted by certain influential archaeologists like Mortimer Wheeler. No primary evidence was really adduced to support the AIT. The theory was rather based on the fact that the Vedic language was determined to belong to the same family as Greek, Latin etc. This langauge family was called the Indo European family or the IE family. Secondly, several arguments of silence were used. For instance, the AIT’ers pointed out that the unearthed motifs of the IVC culture do not show the horse or the spoke wheeled chariot at all whereas these play an important role in the Vedas and also in other IE cultures. Conversely, the supposed absence of mention of items like tigers and rice which were indeed attested at IVC sites in the Rigveda was taken as another proof that the Aryans had nothing to do with the IVC. Certain other curious arguments were also cited. For instance, the AIT’ers pointed that the word for the elephant in the RV was ‘Mrgahastin’ (or ‘the animal with a hand’), indicating that the Aryans found this creature novel after they entered South Asia from Central Asia. Such arguments actually fall flat when it is pointed out that the ‘snake’ is often referred to as ‘toothed rope’ in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Dissenting voices were indeed by Indian scholars raised right from the start, but the AIT was accepted as the correct view by Western and several Indians till recently. In fact, it is still <strong>the</strong> view stated as a fact in works on World History and other related fields due to academic inertia.</p>
<p>Opponents to the AIT were often termed as ‘Hindu chauvinists’, ‘Indian Nationalists’ and so on (and these terms are still used by proponents of the new Avatar of the AIT which is the AMT- see below). In recent decades however, opposition to the AIT has mounted considerably and no respective Indologist will publicly uphold the AIT in its crass form any longer. The following were the objections of the opponents:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is absolutely no archaeological evidence of any invasion of the IVC area by Aryans. No burnt cities, no massive destuctive migration trails. There is also no proof of migration of Dravidian speakers from the IVC area to South India.</li>
<li>The Vedas themselves are completely silent about any migration or invasion. They pre-suppose the geography, flora and fauna of North India and have no traces of any extra-Indian features. (Some scholars still continue to see the rivers and animals of Central Asia, Afghanistan and even Europe in Rigvedic hymns. We can ignore them as being quite farfetched). From very early times, Indians have had no memory of having come from outside to settle down in North India. In fact, the area pre-supposed by the Rigveda and even other Samhitas actually corresponds with the area that the IVC occupied. Any invading race likes to write about its victories and its advent from a foreign land- things which are rather absent in the RV or other Vedic literature. Similarly, the Dravidian speakers themselves have no memory of being pushed south from the IVC area. Rather, their traditions speak of a migration from more southern areas, which were submerged by the encroaching sea!</li>
<li>The verses of Rigveda that supposedly describe the massacres of inhabitants of IVC are grossly misinterpreted. There more credible as well as traditional interpretations do not see any ethnic genocide mentioned therein.</li>
<li>The Anthropologists further said that there is no break in skeletal continuity in NW India from 2800 BCE to around 800 BCE. Therefore, skeletal remains do not support any invasion or even a migration.</li>
<li>Archaeologists point out that if an urban and a literate people like the IVC area inhabitants were pushed to South India, they could have easily set up urban centers there. However, Dravidian culture was clearly Neolithic till the middle of the first millennium BCE. How can a literate and an urban civilization lose its character so fast?</li>
<li>Archaeologists have pointed out that the IVC did not really die out suddenly as would have happened had Aryan invaders or migrants overwhelmed IVC residents. Rather, it moved to new areas like Gujarat, and subsequently to the Gangetic plains. In other words, they see a clear continuity in culture and civilization from IVC to later Ganges based culture.</li>
<li>The Rigveda and even later texts extol the river Sarasvati as the ‘mother of all rivers’. The river is said in the texts to have flowed across Haryana, Rajasthan before joining the sea/disappear into the sands. As we come to later texts, the river diminishes in importance (and size) and then, it is replaced by the Ganges. In fact, satellite imagery in recent decades conclusively established that such a might river did flow in that area and interestingly, the archaeologists have discovered 100’s of new sites around (and even on) the dried bed of the river. The evidence is very clear then- that the maximum concentration of IVC sites was indeed on the Sarasvati river and that the culture moved to other areas when the river dried out. Now, the river seems to have dried out by 1500 BCE, and therefore it follows that the Aryan culture becomes contemporary in time and space with the IVC. The ‘Sarasvati paradigm’ is something, which the modern proponents of AIT (now AMT) have not been able to explain away satisfactorily. In fact, even late Vedic texts mention the performance of rituals on the banks of Sarasvati and Drishdvati, which would be anachronistic of these texts were composed around 600 BCE (which is when the AIT’ers and even most modern Indologists date them).</li>
<li>Frawley’s Paradox: In the case of Aryans, we are left with a massive literature that is several times the length of the Bible. We further know that the extant literature is merely a fraction of what existed once. Yet, we have very little material traces from the period 1400 BCE to 600 BCE in the area and the period when these texts were apparently composed. In contrast, we have in IVC a sprawling civilization covering 1.5 million square km. with more than a 1000 urban sites identified. And yet, there is no literature extant, only a few thousand seals with a few writing symbols.</li>
<li>Genetic evidence also does not lend support to the AIT and is inconclusive at best.</li>
<li>Oceanic Imagery: The internal evidence of texts is also adduced to counter the AIT. It is pointed out that if the Aryans were a pastoral society, their texts would not refer to boats, ships and oceans. In fact, there are more than a 100 references to oceans and ships, which is consistent with the fact that the IVC had archaeologically attested trade relations with the Sumerian culture.</li>
<li>Arguments based on technology are also advanced. It is pointed out that the geometry pre-supposed by the IVC architectural remains is actually reflected in the ritualistic Vedic texts.</li>
<li>A very problematic fact for the proponents of AIT is the fact that the Vedic texts contain certain astronomical information (positions of constellations etc.), which takes us well into the IVC  period (and even beyond that) and area. This could not have been the case if the Aryans were a pastoral society and were resident in Central Asia. In fact, the original location of proto-IE speakers has still not been traced and from the perspective of archaeology, proto-Indo-Europeans remain and enigma. So is it even justified to talk of Aryans as a race? The issue is compounded by the fact that there is no archaeologically attested trail of Aryans even outside India!</li>
<li>The arguments of silence proposed by proponents of AIT are also explained. For instance, although rice is not mentioned in the Rigveda, rice dishes certainly are. And tiger might have been subsumed in the word for lion (as still is the case in modern times to some extent). Alternately, since the tiger was actually present all the way to Central Asia, its non-mention in the Rigveda is merely by chance. Also, the use of the word ‘Mrgahastin’ or ‘Hastin’ for the elephant does not indicate novelty because although snakes occur everywhere in the world except in the Polar region, they are called ‘toothed ropes’ in even a late text like the Atharvaveda. And yet nobody can state that the Aryans saw the snake for the first time when they entered South Asia. In other words, the elephant has been given that name because the Vedic language as such is picturesque.</li>
<li>The notion that the IVC drew a lot from the Sumerian culture and that the Aryans were themselves invaders from Central Asia takes an ‘Iranocentric’ view of Indian civilization. Such a view is now being questioned by archaeologists. They point that most developments in the IVC area were indigenous to India. For instance, it is now believed that Iron was introduced into India from peninsular India. A site called Mehrgarh has been discovered in Baluchistan. At this site, organized agriculture is attested up to 6<sup>th</sup> millennium BCE. This is the time around which agriculture started in the Middle East as well. Excavations have shown that writing originated in the IVC area around 3300 BCE, which is around the time it started in Sumer as well. Very early domestication of animals is now attested archaeologically in IVC area. And in the case of many IVC sites, it now appears that there was a gradual transformation from a pre-historic Neolithic culture to the urban, literate IVC culture, which had a significant interaction with the Neolithic cultures in Vindhyas and also in the east.</li>
<li>The cultural continuity of the IVC culture with much later culture in north India is also stressed to conclude that there was no AIT which lead to a break in the cultural continuity of north India. For instance, it is now known that the weights and the ratios of bricks used in India later on are virtually identical to the corresponding artifacts found in the IVC area.</li>
<li>It is also pointed out that supposed points of distinction between the IVC and the Aryans (viz. the horse, the chariot and iron) should start appearing archaeologically around the time of the supposed invasions/migrations. This is not really the case. Thus, chariots are not attested archaeologically in India till the 3<sup>rd</sup> cent. BCE (although they are mentioned by Greeks around 323 BCE) and likewise, horse remains do not start appearing suddenly around 1200-1400 BCE everywhere in north India. In fact, horse remains have been now found in IVC sites as early as 1700 BCE and even earlier in the non-IVC areas.</li>
<li>All the Indian traditions (Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Atheist) clearly pre-suppose several millennia of development of their philosophical, religious, theological systems. This runs counter to the idea that the Aryans entered India around 1500 BCE and came to dominate only in the course of subsequent centuries.</li>
<li>Cattle breeds in the middle show an ingression of Indian breeds genetically. In murals etc., we see that the Indian humped cattle started appearing in the Middle East around the middle of the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BCE. This is around the same time that the Aryans moved into India from Central Asia. So did the cattle move out of India while men moved into India, at the same time?</li>
</ol>
<p>The results of the objections such as those listed above have lead the proponents of the AIT to reformulate their views in several views. Some Indologists in the West (who are predominantly philologists and linguists) have tried to adduce reasons why the invading Aryans have not left behind any material traces. Thus, they have redefined certain terms in the Vedas to mean something different from their earlier definitions. For instance, The Rigvedic word ‘<em>pur</em>’ which was earlier taken to mean a city or a fortress is now said to denote mud dwellings with palisades and so on. The word ‘<em>grama</em>’ which earlier denoted ‘village’ or a settlement in general is now taken to mean a ‘cart-wagon’ (like that of gypsies). In other words, it is postulated that since the Vedic Aryans were a gypsy like community, they could hardly be expected to leave any material trace!</p>
<p>Most Indologists, having abandoned the idea of large-scale invasions are now proposing other models. For instance, some subscribe to the ‘elite dominance’ model according to which a small number of Indo-Aryan (IA) speakers entered the IVC area to dominate the collapsing IVC and soon came to dominate the natives with the help of horses and chariots (termed as ‘Vedic Tanks.’). These invasions are being re-christened as ‘migrations’ and ‘acculturation’. Some others are proposing a continuous process of interaction of IVC inhabitants with IA speakers of Afghanistan and Bactria accompanied by small-scale migrations (but large scale transfer of language). Needless to say, at this stage, all these models that are being proposed to explain the lack of evidence of invasions are often really invasions described in a euphemistic way, or are completely chaotic and unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>However, the proponents of this Aryan Migration Theory (AMT) have advanced sophisticated arguments based on linguistics to emphasize that at least the horse, the chariot and the language of Vedic Aryans was imported from Central Asia in the late 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BCE. They highlight the fact that in the language tree, Vedic Sanskrit appears a rather late language. They emphasize the supposed cultural dichotomy between IVC (no horse, no chariot, bath, bricks) and the Aryan culture (horse and chariots are important, no public bath, no bricks). They have tried to explain away the astronomical evidence as misinterpretations of Vedic passages and have made (totally unsuccessful) attempts to see a Dravidian language in IVC seal inscriptions. Moreover, they see a ‘Dravidian’ or an ‘Austro-Asiatic’ or even a ‘Language X’ substratum in Rigveda as a proof that when the Aryans came to North India, it already had speakers of proto-Dravidian, para-Munda or of hypothetical languages like the language X. They also suggest that the so-called horse bones unearthed in the IVC area and also in peninsular area actually came from poorly documented excavations. Therefore, they cannot be stratified, and therefore dated perfectly. In other words, they stick to the old paradigm that horse was indeed brought from outside by the Aryans into South Asia. AIT/AMT proponents also seek to malign opponents by branding them as ‘dangerous people’, ‘chauvinists’, ‘Hindutva fanatics’, ‘theologians’ and so on.</p>
<p>To counter these views, the AIT opponents point out that -</p>
<ol>
<li>It is possible that while the RV was indeed composed in the same period as the IVC or even earlier, it was redacted several times and given its present form around the middle of the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BCE so that linguistically its language is close to Greek, Avestan and Latin.</li>
<li>Recent researches have actually shown that when the various books of the RV are arranged chronologically, we have to deduce a movement from east to west (i.e. from Uttar Pradesh to Afghanistan), which is just the opposite of AIT (and is therefore called the Out of India Theory or the OIT).</li>
<li>Third, it is pointed out that the arrival of the horse and the chariot is not attested archaeologically and moreover, the word of horse (=ashva) could have referred to some other similar animal as it did in Sumer.</li>
<li>Fourth, it is proposed that the RV and other Vedic texts do not represent the culture of the IVC area as such, but only of the Haryana/Sarasvati/UP area (which is evident from the internal testimony of the texts as well). Therefore, for this reason and also those stated in the first paragraph of this section, we can hardly expect a 1:1 correspondence between RV culture and IVC.</li>
<li>Fifth, it is shown that the legends in the RV represent the most archaic and holistic versions of several IE mythological themes, indicating that it was rather the IE speakers who left India in various waves.</li>
<li>Sixth, they highlight the fact that names of geographical places in north India and Pakistan do not have any Dravidian or Austro-Asiatic substrate, which is rather odd if the Aryans displaced Dravidian or Austro-Asiatic features.</li>
<li>Seventh, it is stated that if the Aryans had indeed brought the horse into India, then the Dravidian word for the same would have been borrowed from Vedic Sanskrit, but this is not the case.</li>
<li>Eight, it is seen that late chariot features (like spoke wheeled) that are attested only as late as 2000 BCE, are to be found mentioned only in the latest parts of the Rigveda. The earlier parts of Rigveda are actually free of any references to spoke wheeled chariots, and presume only solid wheeled wagons and chariots.</li>
<li>Nine, the presence of Dravidian words as such in the Vedic texts need not pre-suppose a substratum, but only a borrowing from an adjacent culture which was contemporary (and not necessarily one which was overcome via immigration or invasion).</li>
<li>Ten, the AIT/AMT opponents refer to the fact that the horse in the Rigveda has 34 ribs (and is therefore of a South East Asian/South Asian variety now mostly extinct) and is therefore not the Central Asian horse which has 36 ribs. The argument is that had the Aryans brought their horse from Central Asia, it would have had 36 ribs and not 34.</li>
<li>Eleven, AIT opponents point to the fact that certain linguistic peculiarities in modern Indo-Aryan languages of North India are not deductible either from Vedic Sanskrit or from Dravidian/Austro Asiatic. So is the case with numerous aspects of Hindu religion. All this suggests that the Vedas themselves represent the religious beliefs of only a section of the ancestors of modern Hindus. Consequently, it is inaccurate to represent Vedic Aryans as a ‘group’ that displaced IVC people. It is possible rather that inhabitants of different parts of the IVC area, peninsular India and the Gangetic plains were resident in their respective areas for along time and with time, their beliefs fused even further to lead to the formation of the magnificent construct that Hinduism is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Opponents of AIT often tend to point to the Eurocentric or Marxist (within India) biases of the up-holders of AIT/AMT, a charge that is resisted by (some of) them stoutly. A great drawback of the OIT theories is that similar to AIT/AMT, it is not attested archaeologically. In its defense, it must be said however that the theory is rather new and therefore archaeologists will take several years to correlate their data with the suggestions of the OIT’ers, whereas the AIT/AMT has had a head start of 150 years to influence the mute findings of the archaeologists.</p>
<p>It would not be out of place to mention that most recent attempts aimed at the decipherment of the IVC script presume a language related to Sanskrit. All attempts to date have, however, been a failure.</p>
<p>The above was but a brief resume of a few conflicting viewpoints. As things stand, majority of Indologists (Linguists, historians, archaeologists) in India reject the AIT or even the AMT and almost all the archaeologists in the West and an increasing number of specialists from other fields are also rejecting these theories. Some linguists are now proposing that there is no way of determining the IE homeland and so the matter is best left ignored. They also agree that the old paradigms of the spread of the centum and satem groups of IE languages are no longer valid because of the discovery of a centum language recently right in the foothills of Himalayas. In other words, the current state of linguistic data is such that it cannot be used as the primary evidence to support AIT/AMT but rather only as secondary evidence. And as for the primary, alternate, non-linguistic evidence for AIT/AMT - it is not yet forthcoming.</p>
<p>Within India, the matter has become highly politicized. Marxist historians (who have monopolized government institutions and grants in India since 1960’s), politically active or fundamentalist Muslims, Christian missionaries/evangelists, Dravidian Nationalists (and also members of the oppressed lower castes, who are often incited by the aforementioned categories) and many other lay Indians of all religious and political persuasions still defend the AIT or the AMT. In contrast, although a majority of academicians in India have rejected the AIT (and some even the AMT), the anti-AIT view is often associated with Hindutva politics (although there does not appear to be a real cause and effect relationship between them). While proponents of the Hindutva viewpoint would naturally favor OIT today, historically the case has been quite the opposite. In fact, it has been and is still in the interest of Marxists and of the fundamentalist sections of the Indian minorities (as well as the Dravidian Nationalists) to uphold the paradigms foisted on Indians by their erstwhile colonial masters.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we need is a dispassionate look at the multifaceted evidence and also completely de-link the issue of the exact relationship between Aryans and IVC from the question of Indian Nationalism. What happened 35 centuries ago (or a earlier) is hardly of relevance to the question “Who is an Indian” because national identities and borders have been fluctuating all over the world down the ages.</p>
<h3 id="g-methods-of-interpreting-the-vedic-texts">G. Methods of Interpreting the Vedic texts</h3>
<p>Numerous methods have been used in ancient and modern times to interpret Vedic texts. A resume of the same is given below. Note that since the Vedic literature itself is heterogeneous, there isn’t a single method that is best suited for interpreting the entire Vedic literature. For instance, if the hymn in question is merely a praise of an act of charity, it is futile to impart a spiritual meaning to it. So also, if the hymn reflects a spiritual method, it is inaccurate to force a ‘nomadic culture’ meaning into it just to satisfy the requirements of AIT. There is no sharp boundary between these different methods of interpretation, all the more because many of these are indispensable even for the other methods of interpretation. For instance, no one can ignore Vedic grammar while translation Vedic hymns. The various methods of interpretation of Vedic texts are as follows -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Yajnika School</em></strong>: This is a ritualistic interpretation of the Vedas and is exemplified to a great extent in the Brahmana texts themselves. In certain cases, it is seen that the ritual employment of a mantra has no relationship to its actual meaning. Rather, the mantra seems to have been rubricated into the ritual merely on account of the presence of a word or two that have a phonemic similarity to a word that would correctly describe an object or an act connected with the ritual. It must be noted however that the employment of the Vedic Samhitas in rituals has actually contributed to their preservation down the ages. Moreover, the details of the ritual acts in the Brahmanas often give some measure of the cultural background and the material aspects of ancient India. Last, the Samhitas of Yajurveda and Samaveda are in reality liturgically arranged for aid in ritual performances. After the Samhitas and the Brahmanas, we have another vast corpus of literature called the Kalpasutra, which describes the minutiae of Vedic rituals in a systematic and a comprehensive manner. The Kalpasutras are considered in a separate section. Most of the extant commentaries of the Vedas follow this technique although they draw elements from other modes of interpretation as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Nairukta School:</em></strong> This is the etymological method of interpretation of words or phrases occurring in the Vedic mantras and its origins can be traced to the Brahmana text themselves. The text par excellence of this mode of interpretation is the Nirukta of Yaska, which itself is a commentary on a collection (called Nighantu) of difficult words occurring in the Vedas. The Nirukta of Yaska was apparently preceded by a dozen works belonging to this genre as he quotes them profusely. Nirukta is considered one of the 6 Vedangas of the Veda along with grammar, astronomy, phonetics, ritual and prosody.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Dharmashastric School:</em></strong> In his Nirukta, Yaska quotes the opinion of some who derive legal instructions from certain verses of the Rigveda. For instance, in Nirukta 3.3, he observes that some interpret Rigveda 3.31.1 to mean that daughters can also inherit the property of their father whereas some state that only sons are eligible for inheritance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Naidana School:</em></strong> Nothing much is known about this school of interpretation although a text called the Nidana Sutra by Patanjali exists. From the citations of their views in the Nirukta of Yaska, it appears that they were closely allied to the Aitihasika school of interpretation with the caveat that they paid more attention to the original context of or the cause for the composition of Vedic hymns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Mimamsaka School</em></strong>: The followers of this school believe that all the Vedic texts should be treated as a harmonious whole, that the correct import of the hymns can be understood if we consider the context, the relationship of various sentences and of words in those sentences; if we consider parallel passages in various texts; and if we interpret passages after determining their central import. Unfortunately, the method is mostly restricted to the interpretation of Brahmanas, Aranyakas and the Upanishads, as exemplified in the Purva and Uttara Mimansa Sutras (and also numerous commentaries on them). The Vedas are considered eternal, uncreated Word, free of any references to temporal events and free of defects associated with human compositions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Aitihasika School:</em></strong> The followers of this school of interpretation hold that each and every mantra or hymn is related to an Itihasa i.e., a traditional account of ancient events, and accordingly they interpret the concerned hymn or verses in conjunction with that Itihasa.  For instance, Yaska narrates an Itihasa connected with the Nadi Sukta (Rigveda III.33) wherein Sage Visvamitra is said to have addressed the rivers with the concerned mantras whereupon they allowed him to cross over. The Brahmana texts contain numerous such Itihasas and the now-lost Shatyayani Brahman is often quoted by the commentators of Rigveda for these Itihasas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Parivrajaka School:</em></strong> This school seeks to highlight the spiritual import of mantras. While several hymns of the Vedic Samhitas indeed convey spiritual ideas very directly, followers of this school of thought hold that even the other hymns can be explained in a spiritualistic manner. Examples of this method of interpretation are the commentary on the first 40 hymns by Shri Madhvacharya (13<sup>th</sup> cent. C.E.) and the commentary of Atmananda on the Asya Vamasya Sukta (Rigveda I.164). Kapali Shastri has written a spiritual commentary on the entire first Ashtaka of the Rigveda while Swami Brahmamuni has written a spiritual commentary on the entire Kauthuma Samaveda Samhita. This is not to say that this mode of interpretation is modern. Rather, the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and the Upanishads themselves expound numerous verses in the spiritual mode. In his Nirukta, Yaska cites the views of several followers of this method of interpretation, as does Sayana in his commentaries on various Vedic texts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Vaiyyakarana School:</em></strong> This is a general method of interpretation by the application of the rules of grammar to Vedic mantras. It is taken into account by all the other schools while commenting on the mantras. The Padapathas of the Vedic Samhitas is the earliest such commentary on these texts. These Padapathas seek to analyze the compound words occurring in the mantras according to certain rules of grammar. The Padapatha of Rigveda Samhita is by Shakalya, on Samaveda Samhita is by Gargya, and on the Taittiriya Samhita is by Atreya. The Padapathas on the Shaunakiya Atharvaveda Samhita, Maitrayani Samhita, Rigvediya Shankhayana Samhita, Rigvediya Ashvalayana Samhita, Shukla Yajurvediya Kanva Samhita and the Madhyandina Samhita also exist but are anonymous. Later grammarians however often reject a few analysis contained in the Padapatha as being opposed to the rules of grammar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Arya Samaj School of Interpretation:</em></strong> This was found by Swami Dayanand Sarasvati (1824-1883) and is exemplified by his commentary on the Madhyandina Yajurveda Samhita and approximately 7.5 mandalas of the Rigveda Samhita. After him, various scholars of the Arya Samaj have written numerous commentaries on the 4 major Vedic Samhitas in English, Hindi, Marathi and other Indian languages. These commentaries conform to the ideals regarding the Vedas propagated by the Arya Samaj: First, the Vedas are held to preach pure monotheism and therefore Agni, Indra etc., are held to be merely names of the one God. Second, the Vedas are said to encompass the Samhitas only, not the Brahmanas. Third, the Vedas are said to be the eternal word of God revealed at the beginning of creation, and as such, they are devoid completely of historical accounts or proper names. Fourth, since the Vedas are divine knowledge, they contain all the branches of knowledge (even modern ones like telegraphy, aeronautics and so on) in the root form. Fifth, all the modern commentaries on the Vedas are held to be spurious. Only the works composed by sages from Brahma to Jaimini (including the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Sutras and so on) are held to reliable commentaries on the Vedas. Even these are to be rejected in so far as they are in conflict with the intent of the Samhitas. Sixth, even amongst the Samhitas, only the following 4 were revealed by God- Shakalya, Madhyandina, Shaunaka and Kauthuma. All the other Samhitas are composed by men and are like glosses on these 5 Samhitas. Seventh, the method of Yaska and Vyakarana are to be relied upon heavily to interpret the Vedas and the later Hindu texts like Puranas etc., must be rejected completely. There are several other principles followed by this school of interpretation (in one of his own works, Swami Dayanand himself lists 16 such principles).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**_Shri Aurobindo’s School of Interpretation: _**This is a modern version of the ancient Parivrajaka school of interpretation and is discussed in numerous works of Sri Aurobindo like ‘The Secret of the Veda’ and of his followers like Kapali Shastri and David Frawley. Herein, the various gods in the Samhitas are said to represent different states of consciousness on the spiritual journey of men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Pauranic School:</em></strong> This is not really a school of interpretation, and refers to a few partial commentaries on the Vedic Samhitas that seek to discover the biographies of Hindu deities like Sri Rama and Sri Krishna in the hymns. This method is similar to the Aitihasika school, with the big difference that here that the ‘Itihasa’ does not pertain to the Seer of the hymn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Indological Method</em></strong>: This method is adopted currently by virtually all Vedic Scholars outside India and also by numerous scholars within India. It is has the greatest internal diversity and we have lumped various methods of interpretation of the Vedas only for the sake of convenience. Several members of this school take the Rigveda to be an Indo-European text that must be interpreted with the help of parallel traditions in the other branches of the Indo-European language family. Linguistics and Philology are relied upon heavily. Some Indologists like Ludwig suggested wholesale emendations in the traditionally handed texts, whereas others, like Max Mueller, strongly advocated the accuracy of the traditionally handed text. Scholars like Oldenberg completely rejected the traditional commentaries like those of Sayana, while others like Pischel emphasized that the Vedas are Indian texts and ought to be interpreted keeping in mind Indian paradigms as reflected in the traditional commentaries. Indologists of course take into account the Vedic Vyakarana, Nirukta and the Brahmanas and Kalpasutras into account, but are often also seen to reject their testimony on various grounds, some of which are highly conjectural. For instance, the AIT was taken as gospel truth in the past and accordingly a lot of hymns were interpreted as if they represented battles between tall, fair, long nosed Aryans and black, short native Indians. The most remarkable contributions of these scholars have been the creation of massive concordances, indices and scholarly exegetical notes on the Vedic texts (besides publishing critical editions of the same), correlation of ideas mentioned in the Vedic texts with parallel ideas in other literary traditions, analysis of the internal chronology of these texts and composition of exhaustive commentaries and translations in various languages. At times however, some of this work appears to be mere conjecture dressed up in jargon of the field, and too divorced from what the Vedic tradition has to say about itself. Nevertheless, an intensive study of both modern as well as old exegetical traditions is a must for comprehending the Vedic texts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Polytheism, monotheism, monism have all been read into the Vedic hymns. Max Muller even coined the term “henotheism”, as the transitional stage between polytheism and monotheism in the hymns. It is the opinion of modern scholarship that the Vedic hymns reveal the gradual progress of philosophical thought i.e., from polytheism to monotheism to monism. This major flaw in interpretation is not surprising when it is understood that such an opinion springs from viewing Indian philosophy through a Western philosophical looking glass.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between Western philosophy and Indian philosophy, especially the scriptures, is that while Western philosophy tries to uncover the real with the use of the intellect, Indian philosophy is basically an attempt to logically reconcile the world of experience with the spiritual experience of the sages. The sages – Yajnavalkya, the Buddha, Mahaveera – had experienced reality – unlike Western philosophers they’re not speculating, analyzing with the help of reason what reality may be – they know what it is. They have experienced it and using analogies they try to describe it. Indian scholarship is more interested in seeking the ‘fruit’ of Vedic studies, whereas the Western scholarship concerned primarily with the ‘roots’ of the Vedic texts and words.</p>
<p>The scriptures are not to be interpreted as progress in philosophical thought. What’s claimed as polytheism and monotheism is but the identification of the various manifestations of the One Supreme Being. Unity in the Divine is what the Vedic Sages have proclaimed as the highest teaching and numerous verses supporting this are spread across each Veda, from the first mantra portion to the last Upanishad portion: “the One real which the wise declare as many”; “Purusha is all this, all that was and all that will be”; “the real essence of the Gods is one”; “The same real is worshipped as Uktha in the Rg, Agni in the Yajus and Mahavrta in the Saman”; “the indescribable is the ground of all names and forms, the support of all the creation”; “He is immanent in all this creation and yet he transcends it”.</p>
<p>Likewise the different parts of the Veda – Mantras, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and the Upanishads – too don’t signify the progress of philosophical thought. The Veda is a whole package towards spiritual liberation. One cannot directly start with the Upanishads, which teach the highest truth. One must first develop the physical, mental and moral maturity to be eligible to learn such truth. The Mantras, Brahmanas and parts of the Aranyakas serve such a purpose. The four parts of each Veda can also be mapped to the four stages of life (ashrama) of the twice born (dvija). As a student (brahmachArin) one is to chant the hymns and live a life of control and virtue. As a householder (grhasta) one is to observe the injunctions laid forth in the brAhmanas. In the forest dweller stage (vAnaprastha) one is to meditate upon the spiritual truths behind the rituals as explained in the Aranyakas and practice austerity. With the mental and moral maturity developed during the three previous stages one can finally take up the life of a wandering mendicant (samnyAsin) and study the highest truth taught in the Upanishads. Such is the orthodox Indian view.</p>

<p><strong>1. Hymn to Agni RV 1.1.1-9</strong></p>
<p>I praise Agni, put at the head of the sacrifice, God, priest, Hotr, distributing great riches. ||1||</p>
<p>Agni is fit to be praised by former and also by present seers; he shall bring the gods here.||2||</p>
<p>Through Agni one expects to gain day by day, wealth, indeed prosperity, which is honorable, most abundant in heroes. ||3||</p>
<p>Agni, the ritualistic sacrificial worship which you are pervading everywhere, assuredly goes to the gods. ||4||</p>
<p>Agni, Hotr, wise, truthful, having most wonderful fame, God, may he come with the gods. ||5||</p>
<p>Indeed O Agni! When you intend to bestow good fortune to the worshipper, that Angiras is surely your truth. ||6||</p>
<p>Daily, O Agni! The lighter of darkness, we approach you with prayer, bearing obeisance. ||7||</p>
<p>We come to you, who are ruler of sacrificial rites, guardian of cosmic law, bright, growing in your home. ||8||</p>
<p>Agni, be easily accessible to us, like father to son, accompany us for good fortune. ||9||</p>
<p><strong>2. Hymn to Indra (Rigveda VIII.45.1-3)</strong></p>
<p>Let those who come here light the fore and spread the grass in unbroken line, who have Indra, ever young, for a friend. ||1||</p>
<p>Large the fuel, great is the chant, and high is the sacrificial pole of those who have Indra, ever young, for a friend. ||2||</p>
<p>Irresistible in war, the hero drives the foe with warriors, who have Indra, ever young, for a friend. ||3||</p>
<p><strong>3. Jnana Sukta (Rigveda X.71.1-11)</strong></p>
<p>When, Lord of our Prayer! The First of the sacred Speech, and the Foremost,</p>
<p>The sages uttered, giving the Un-named a name.</p>
<p>Which was their best, and their most stainless,</p>
<p>Then they, with love, revealed the Divine secret in their souls. ||1||</p>
<p>When the sages formed the Speech with their mind,</p>
<p>Straining it, as they strain flour with the sieve,</p>
<p>Therein have friends discovered the bonds of friendship,</p>
<p>Whose holy beauty lies hidden in that Speech. ||2||</p>
<p>With worship they followed the steps of the Speech,</p>
<p>And found it installed in the hearts of sages.</p>
<p>They acquired it and gave it at many places,</p>
<p>And seven singers intone it together. ||3||</p>
<p>There is the man who sees but has not seen the Speech!</p>
<p>There is the man who hears but has not heard her!</p>
<p>But to another, Lady Speech reveals her lovely form,</p>
<p>Like a loving wife, finely robed, to her husband. ||4||</p>
<p>There is a man who, they say, is firm and secure in friendship,</p>
<p>None should urge him to contests.</p>
<p>But he wanders, with an illusion that is barren,</p>
<p>And the speech he hears bears no fruit or flower! ||5||</p>
<p>For one deserting a friend who knows the truth,</p>
<p>There is no grace even in the holy Speech.</p>
<p>What he hears, he hears amiss,</p>
<p>Aye, to be sure, he does not know the path of righteousness! ||6||</p>
<p>Friends who are well endowed with sight and hearing,</p>
<p>Are unequal in the quickness of their mind.</p>
<p>Some look like pools that reach to the mouth or the armpit,</p>
<p>And some like lakes on which a man can bathe. ||7||</p>
<p>When, with the mental impulse shaped by the Spirit,</p>
<p>Friends who know the Speech perform rituals together,</p>
<p>Some are left back with much they still need to know,</p>
<p>While others move onward, regarded as adepts. ||8||</p>
<p>Those, who go neither backward nor forward,</p>
<p>Are no men of knowledge!</p>
<p>Nor performs of the sacred rites, they, the inept ones,</p>
<p>sinfully seize the Speech,</p>
<p>And spread it out as weavers weave the thread. ||9||</p>
<p>All a delighted when a friend comes,</p>
<p>Crowned with fame, a victor in the Assembly.</p>
<p>He wards off their sins, wins for them nurture,</p>
<p>And is always prepared for the tribulations of life. ||10||</p>
<p>One is strong with the power of the verses,</p>
<p>The second sings the song in the Sakvari measure.</p>
<p>The third, an adept, speaks of the knowledge of the Spirit,</p>
<p>And the last lays down the rules of the sacred rites. ||11||</p>
<p><strong>4. Purusha Sukta (Rigveda X.90.1-16)</strong></p>
<p>Purusha is 1000 headed, 1000 eyed, 1000 footed;</p>
<p>And, pervading the earth on all sides</p>
<p>He exists beyond the 10 directions. ||1||</p>
<p>(Purusha = Immanent, Creator God)</p>
<p>Purusha indeed is all this,</p>
<p>What has been and what will be,</p>
<p>And the Lord of immortality</p>
<p>Transcending by mortal nurture. ||2||</p>
<p>Such is his magnificence, but</p>
<p>Purusha is greater than this;</p>
<p>All beings are a fourth of him,</p>
<p>Three fourths- his immortality-lie in heaven. ||3||</p>
<p>Three-fourths of Purusha ascended,</p>
<p>The fourth part was here again and again,</p>
<p>And, diversified in form, it moved</p>
<p>To the animate and the inanimate world. ||4||</p>
<p>From him was Viraj born, and</p>
<p>From Viraj was born Purusha;</p>
<p>And, as soon as born, he spread over</p>
<p>The earth from behind and front. ||5||</p>
<p>When with Purusha as offering</p>
<p>The Devas performed a sacrifice,</p>
<p>Spring was the molten butter, summer</p>
<p>The fuel, and autumn the oblation. ||6||</p>
<p>On the grass they besprinkled him,</p>
<p>The Sacrifice Purusha, the first born,</p>
<p>With Him the gods sacrificed,</p>
<p>And those Sadhyas and the Rishis. ||7||</p>
<p>From that sacrifice, fully offered,</p>
<p>Was gathered the mixed milk and butter.</p>
<p>And animals ruled by Vayu arose</p>
<p>The sylvan and the domestic. ||8||</p>
<p>From that sacrifice, fully offered,</p>
<p>The Rik and the Saman were born,</p>
<p>The Chhandas was born of that,</p>
<p>And from that was the Yajus born. ||9||</p>
<p>From that were born horses, and the</p>
<p>Animals with two rows of teeth;</p>
<p>Yea, kine were born of that, and</p>
<p>Of that were born the goat and the sheep. ||10||</p>
<p>When they divided the Purusha,</p>
<p>Into how many parts did they arrange him?</p>
<p>What was his mouth? What were his two arms?</p>
<p>What are his thighs and feet called? ||11||</p>
<p>The brAhmana (priest) was his mouth,</p>
<p>If his two arms were made the rAjanya (kshatriya - warrior),</p>
<p>His two thighs the vaishya (merchant and agriculturist),</p>
<p>From his feet the shudra (laborer class) was born. ||12||</p>
<p>From his mind was born the moon, and</p>
<p>From his eye the sun. From his mouth</p>
<p>Were Indra and Agni born,</p>
<p>And Vayu was born from his breath. ||13||</p>
<p>From his navel came the mid-air,</p>
<p>From his head the sky was fashioned,</p>
<p>From his feet the earth, and from his ear,</p>
<p>The quarters. Thus they formed the worlds. ||14||</p>
<p>Seven were the sticks of the enclosure</p>
<p>Thrice seven the logs of wood prepared,</p>
<p>When the gods, performing the rite,</p>
<p>Bound, as their victim, Purusha. ||15||</p>
<p>With sacrifices the gods worshipped the Sacrifice,</p>
<p>Those were the earliest holy ordinances.</p>
<p>The mighty Ones attained the height of heaven</p>
<p>Where the ancient Devas, the Sadhyas, abide. ||16||</p>
<p><strong>5. The Nasadiya Hymn (Rigveda X.129-1-7)</strong></p>
<p>Neither Being nor nor-Being existed then;</p>
<p>There was no sky, nor the heaven, which is beyond.</p>
<p>What covered? Where was it and in whose shelter?</p>
<p>Was the water the deep abyss in which it lay? ||1||</p>
<p>There was no death, hence neither was anything immortal;</p>
<p>There was no distinction between night and day.</p>
<p>By its inherent force the One breathed windless;</p>
<p>Nothing other than that existed. ||2||</p>
<p>Darkness there was,</p>
<p>In the beginning all this was a sea without light;</p>
<p>That which, becoming, by the void was covered,</p>
<p>That One by the force of heat came into being. ||3||</p>
<p>Desire entered the One in the beginning,</p>
<p>It was the earliest seed, the product of thought.</p>
<p>The Sages searching in their hearts with wisdom</p>
<p>Found the bond of Being in non-Being.</p>
<p>Their ray extended light across the darkness;</p>
<p>But was the One below or was it above?</p>
<p>Creative force and fertile power was there;</p>
<p>Below was energy and will, above. ||4-5||</p>
<p>Who knows for certain? Who shall declare it here?</p>
<p>When was it born and when came the creation?</p>
<p>The Gods came later,</p>
<p>Who then knows when it arose? ||6||</p>
<p>None know when creation has arisen;</p>
<p>Whether he made it or did not make it,</p>
<p>He who surveys it in the highest heaven,</p>
<p>Only He knows, or maybe even he knows not! ||7||</p>
<p><strong>6. Samjnana Sukta (Rigveda X.191.2-4)</strong></p>
<p>Walk together in harmony, speak in harmony</p>
<p>Let your minds be of one accord,</p>
<p>As the gods of old, being of one mind,</p>
<p>Accepted the share of sacrifice</p>
<p>(so may you share your belongings). ||2||</p>
<p>May your counsel be common, your assembly united,</p>
<p>Common the mind, and the thoughts of these- united.</p>
<p>A common purpose do I lay before you,</p>
<p>And worship with your common oblation. ||3||</p>
<p>Let your aims be common,</p>
<p>And your hearts of one accord,</p>
<p>And all of you be of one mind,</p>
<p>As you may live well together. ||4||</p>

<p>“Some ask- ‘If a man establishes the sacrificial fire and then dies while touring abroad, then how does one do his Agnihotra. To this, we reply that it is to be performed by offering the oblation of the milk of a cow which has been suckled by a calf that is not its own. This is because the milk of such a cow is akin in nature to the Agnihotra of such a dead man. Alternately, perform the Agnihotra with the milk of any cow. Others state the relatives of the dead man should keep the alters of that man fired up without offering sacrificial oblations till the bones of the dead man have been collected after cremation of his corpse. And if the corpse is not traceable, then twigs from 360 ‘flame of the forest’ trees should be cut and fashioned into a human figure. This should then be cremated with full ceremony and at that time, the fires from the altar established by the dead man should be extinguished by a transfer to his funeral pyre. The likeness of the corpse should be created in this manner- 150 twigs for the torso, 140 for the twigs for the two thighs. 50 for the legs and the rest should be placed above its head. Thus ends the procedure for the atonement performed for a man who establishes a sacrificial fire in the altar but dies while touring abroad.” XXXII.1-2</p>

<p>Chapter XIII: Thereafter, when the body is made fit for a state of desirelessness, he should be bent over the offering to Brahman. In this way, he will drive repeated deaths away. “The Soul is to be envisioned, to be heard, to be thought of and to be meditated upon.” “Him (the Soul) they aspire to know by reciting the Vedas, by practicing the rigors of studentship (including celibacy), by asceticism, by faith, by ritual sacrifices and by fasting” says Sage Mandukeya. “Therefore, he who knows this should, becoming tranquil, restrained (in senses), still in meditation, enduring of the opposites and immersed in faith, perceive the Soul in his own soul,” thus says Sage Madavya. That Purusha, who lives in the midst of life forces, and is a repository of consciousness, is incomprehensible and ought to be distinguished (form the animate and inanimate creation) as ‘Not this, Not this’ this.” “This Soul alone is the Kshatriya, it is the Brahminhood, it is all the divine beings, the Vedas, all the worlds, it is all beings, indeed it is all! This Soul is that is designated by ‘Tat tvam asi’ (That Thou are). This Soul is to be comprehended in ‘I am Brahman’. This Brahman (the Supreme Soul), without any predecessor, without any superior, without another equivalent, immanent in all, without an exterior (i.e. all pervading), is this Soul- the Brahman (the Supreme Being), the entity that experiences everything in the Universe- such is the doctrine”- says Sage Yajnavalkya.</p>
<p>Chapter XIV: The best of the Riks, the best of the Yaju mantras, pinnacle of the Saman chants, the crown of the head of the Atharvans- he who studies not the Veda is indeed called ignorant. He (as if) cleaving is head himself, becomes a corpse.” (And) he is but a (lifeless) pillar that bears a burden, who recites the Veda without knowing the meaning of his chants. (But) he who knows the meaning along wins prosperity. He rises to Heaven, shaking off his sin through Spiritual Knowledge.”</p>

He who has attained the Supreme Knowledge through Samnyasa (renunciation) is indeed this Purusha. He is all that is perceptible in the present, was perceptible in the past and will be perceptible in the future. Though apparently human, His true nature is that which is settled by the Vedas and what is attained by his new birth is in right knowledge. He is firmly established in the richness of knowledge imparted by His teacher, as also in his faith and in Truth. He has become the self resplendent. Being such a one, He remains beyond/separate the darkness of ignorance. O Aruni! Having become one possessed of knowledge by realizing Him, the Supreme, through Samnyasa, and with your mind fixed in your heart, do not again fall a prey to death.

<p><strong>2. Narayana Sukta (Prapathaka X, Anuvaka 13)</strong></p>
<p>“This universe is the Eternal Being (Narayana), the imperishable, the supreme, the goal, multi-headed and multi-eyed (i.e.,omnipresent and omniscient), the resplendent, the source of delight for the whole universe. This universe is the Supreme Being (Purusha) alone; hence it subsists on That, the Eternal which transcends it (in every way), -the omnipresent Absolute which destroys all sins. The protector of the universe, the Lord of all Souls (or Lord over Self), the perpetual, the auspicious, the indestructible, the Goal of all creation, the Supreme object worthy of being known, the Soul of all beings, the Refuge unfailing (is He).  The Lord Narayana is the Supreme Absolute; Narayana is the Supreme Reality; Narayana is the Supreme Light; Narayana is the Supreme Self; Narayana is the Supreme Meditator; Narayana is the Supreme Meditation.  Whatever all this universe is, -seen or heard of, -pervading all this from inside and outside alike, stands supreme the Eternal Divine Being (Narayana). He is the Limitless, Imperishable, Omniscient, residing in the ocean of he heart, the Cause of the happiness of the universe, the Supreme end of all striving, (manifesting Himself) in the ether of the heart which is comparable to an inverted bud of the lotus flower.  Below the Adams apple, at a distance of a span, and above the navel (i.e., the heart which is the relative seat of the manifestation of Pure Consciousness in the human being), effulges the Great Abode of the universe, as if adorned with garlands of flames. Surrounded on all sides by nerve-currents (or arteries), suspends the lotus-bud of the heart in an inverted position. It is in a subtle space (a narrow aperture, the Sushumna-Nadi), and therein is to be found the Substratum of all things. In that space within the heart resides the Great Flaming Fire, undecaying, all-knowing, with tongues spread out in all directions, with faces turned everywhere, consuming food presented before it, and assimilating it unto itself. His rays, spreading all around, side ways as well as above and below, warm up the whole body from head to foot. In the center of That (Flame) abides the Tongue of Fire as the topmost of all subtle things. (Note: Due to the attachments and entanglements of the Jiva in worldly enjoyment and suffering, the Consciousness is enshrouded in potential as well as expressed objectivity, and hence it appears like a tiny streak of flame within the dark clouds of ignorance. But when the Jiva rises above worldliness the Consciousness is realized as he Infinite.) Brilliant like a streak of lightning set in the midst of the blue rain-bearing clouds, slender like the awn of a paddy grain, yellow (like gold) in colour, in subtlety comparable to the minute atom, (this Tongue of Fire) grows splendid. In the Middle of That Flame, the Supreme Self dwells. This (Self) is Brahma (the Creator), Siva (the Destroyer), Hari (the Protector), Indra (the Ruler), the Imperishable, the Absolute, the Autonomous Being. Prostrations again and again to the Omni-Formed Being, the Truth, the Law, the Supreme Absolute, the Purusha of blue-decked yellow hue, the Centralised-Force, Power, the All-Seeing One. Prostrations again and again to the Omni-Formed Being, the Truth, the Law, the Supreme Absolute, the Purusha of blue-decked yellow hue, the Centralised-Force, Power, the All-Seeing One.

Tell us- which one is the best for us?’ Then he replied to them: “All these are merely the manifest/frontal forms of Brahman, the Immmortal, the Formless. To whichever form each man is devoted here, in the realm of that deity does that man rejoices. For it has been said- ‘Verily, this whole is Brahman.

<h2 id="the-upanishads-an-alphabetical-list">The Upanishads: An Alphabetical List</h2>
<p>The Upanishads are the best known, and the most authoritative texts of Hindu spirituality. They form the core of Vedanta, a school of philosophy now generally taken as a synonymn for Hindu philosophy and spirituality.<sup id="fnref:168"><a href="#fn:168" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">168</a></sup> Generally, the Upanishads are taken to mean the 10 odd texts, which have been commented upon by by notable Vedantins like Sri Sankaracarya and Sri Madvacharya<sup id="fnref:169"><a href="#fn:169" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">169</a></sup>. However, Hindu tradition recognizes more than 200 texts as Upanishads. Collectively, these texts deal with a wide variety if topics – spirituality, devotion, yoga, asceticism, sectarian worship and meditation, esoteric meanings of rituals and even magical charms<sup id="fnref:170"><a href="#fn:170" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">170</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This paper lists, in an alphabetical order, the names of all texts designated as ‘Upanishads’, ‘Brahmana-Upanishad’ and ‘Upanishad-Brahmana’ by the Hindu tradition. Under each name, the following additional information will be provided –</p>

<p>The following important pieces of information have been omitted in this paper. –</p>
<ol>
<li>An exhaustive list of translations and commentaries on the text</li>
<li>Chronological information</li>
<li>Category or class under which the Upanishad is included<sup id="fnref:173"><a href="#fn:173" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">173</a></sup>
These will be dealt with in other papers, that are currently under preparation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the texts designated by tradition as Upanishads etc., I have added information on those specific hymns, chapters, and longish sections from four Vedic Samhitas, Brahmanas and Aranyakas, whose contents are similar to the ideas of the ten major Upanishads.</p>
<p>The four Samhitas that I have considered here are: Rgveda Samhita<sup id="fnref:174"><a href="#fn:174" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">174</a></sup> (together with the Khilmantra collection<sup id="fnref:175"><a href="#fn:175" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">175</a></sup>), Vajasneyi Samhita (in its Madhyandina and Kanva versions<sup id="fnref:176"><a href="#fn:176" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">176</a></sup>), Atharvaveda’s Shaunakiya Samhita<sup>9</sup>, Atharvaveda’s Paippalada Samhita<sup id="fnref:177"><a href="#fn:177" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">177</a></sup>. The Samhitas of Samaveda are left out because they have very little original material<sup id="fnref:178"><a href="#fn:178" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">178</a></sup>. The Samhitas of Krshna Yajurveda are also ignored by and large<sup id="fnref:179"><a href="#fn:179" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">179</a></sup>, because their ‘Upanishadic’ matter is minimal, and is found in isolated, short sections, embedded in the larger ritualistic material<sup id="fnref:180"><a href="#fn:180" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">180</a></sup>. There is considerable Upanishadic material in the Jaiminiya Brahmana, Shatpatha Brahmana<sup id="fnref:181"><a href="#fn:181" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">181</a></sup>, Taittiriya Brahmanas and the Gopatha Brahmana, with some of their ‘Upanishadic’ sections being quite long<sup id="fnref:182"><a href="#fn:182" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">182</a></sup>, as long as some Upanishads themselves. The Brahmanas have dozens of ad-hoc cosmogonical legends<sup id="fnref:183"><a href="#fn:183" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">183</a></sup> and theories embedded in their ritualistic matter. These have been ignored, and so have been the numerous short sentences or sections having a spiritual tinge. This paper considers only those sections of the Brahmanas and the Aranyakas that are ‘Upanishadic’ and are fairly long.</p>
<p>Some scholarly readers might consider my selection of individual ‘Upanishadic’ sections from the Samhita-Brahmana-Aranyaka literature as idiosyncratic. Such readers must appreciate the fact that any such selection is bound to be subjective. This is because the subject matter covered by the Upanishadic texts is very large, and there is a great overlap of their doctrines with those found in other Hindu texts. With some justification or the other, it is even possible to treat the entire Rgveda as a spiritual text. Tarkateerth Lakshman Shastri Joshi has already done a very comprehensive collection<sup id="fnref:184"><a href="#fn:184" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">184</a></sup> of ‘Upanishadic’ passages, from the Samhita-Brahmana-Aranyaka literature. He has included the cosmological legends and short sections omitted in this paper. Numerous smaller anthologies of ‘speculative’ hymns from Vedic texts have also appeared in print<sup id="fnref:185"><a href="#fn:185" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">185</a></sup>. In the preparation of this paper, these published works have been of immense help, and I request the interested reader also to refer the same.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that several Upanishads have also been lost over the last three millennia, much like the bulk of Vedic literature. Occassionally, one encounters quotations from these lost Upanishads in later literature. Appendix I lists these lost Upanishads, along with with references to later texts that cite them<sup id="fnref:186"><a href="#fn:186" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">186</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="aksyupanishad">Aksyupanishad</h3>
<p>The text has two northern and 1 southern versions. Of the northern version, there are two tyoes – a shorter one called the Netropanishad, and a longer one titled the Asyupanishad. In the version that is prevalent in southern India, there are two parts. The first part is called the ‘Cakushmati vidyaa’ and is practically identical with the entire text of the northern version. The second part is a brahmavidyaa of the seven Yogabhumikas, and is absent in the northern version. This brahmavidyaa comprises of 38 or 39 shlokas.</p>
<p>There is a Bhashya of Appayadikshita (d. 1901) available in manuscript, at the Adyar Library [SCHRADER 1908:123-4]. The colophons attach the text to Sukla-Yajurveda.</p>
<p>**Allopanishad: **According to SCHRADER [1908:136-7], the text was composed in the reign of Akbar, to propagate his idea of a universal religion. The text is considered spurious in southern Indi, but is considered sufficiently authoritative in northern India, to be recited by Brahmins in the house of a twice-born Hindu at the Vasantotsva or similar occasions when a few select texts from the four Vedas are read. Interestingly, Swami Dayanand Sarasvati (d. 1883) closes the discussion of Islam (in chapter XIV of his magnum opus, the Satyartha Prakasha) with a comment on the authenticity of this text. He emphasizes that the text is spurious, and that therefore the religion of Islam cannot be derived from any Vedic roots.</p>
<p>The Upanishad as such does not admit that Allah is the deity of another religion. Rather, the word is taken as a synonym of Varuna. Prominent deities mentioned in this text are Mitra, Varuna and Allah. SCHRADER [ibid.] notes that Allah is introduced through the medium of Vedic personages such as Ila or Ida. The text is marked with Vedic accents, but the printed versions as such show several faults of grammar and accent.</p>
<p>Attempts to integrate this spurious text with the Vedic tradition are seen in the existence of even a jaTaapaaTha manuscript, with accents [SCHRADER 1908:68].</p>

Nilakantha gives a reason for this omission and states that these two Brahmanas strictly belong to Asvamedha Karmakanda and are dealt with in the 10th prapathaka of Madhyandina Satapatha Brahmana.

<li>
<p>Vakyakara Brahmanandin: A brief comment, called the ‘Vakya’. The work is considered lost but extensive quotations from it are encountered in the works of Advaitins and Vishishtadvaitins. I have collected these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bhasyakara Dramidacarya: A commentary on # 1 above. Large and small extracts from the Bhashya are encountered in works like Vedarthasamgraha and Shri Bhashya of Shri Ramanujacharya, subcommentaries thereon by Sudarshana Suri, Rudraskanda’s vrtti on Drahyayana Kalpa; Parashara Bhattar’s commentary on the Sri Vishnu Sahasranama and so on. I have collected these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shankaracharya (Advaita): He terms his Bhashya as a short ‘Vrtti’ in the introductory portion. Anandagiri explains that the word ‘short’ is used to contrast it with the massive commentary of Dramidacharya. The commentary refers to some textual variants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bhaskara Bhatta (Bhedabheda perspective): Lost, and referred to in Bhaskara’s own commentary on the Brahmasutras. Numerous citations from this work are actually encountered with in the Tippana of Narottama Puri (see below). From these extracts it is clear that Bhaskara pre-supposed the Bhashya of Shankaracharya on this Upanishad, and criticized it in his own commentary. This might be taken as conclusive proof for the genuine character of Shri Shankaracharya’s commentary on the Chhandogya Upanishad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Narendra Puri: A brief comment (‘Tippana’) on Shankaracharya’s commentary. It criticizes the Bhashya of Bhaskara in a very vitriolic language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Madhvacarya (Dvaita perspective): Characteristic of his style, he interprets numerous passages in a very different manner than other traditional commentaries on the text. Significant philosophically is his unique interpretation of the <em>mahavakya ‘Tat tvam asi’</em> in the 6<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Upanishad. Madhvacharya interprets it as ‘<em>atat tvam asi’</em> and marshals numerous reasons for doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anandagiri: A gloss (= Tika) on Shri Shankaracharya’s Bhashya. It follows the Tippana of Narottama Puri very closely, especially in the identification of allusions to the Dramida Bhashya in Shankaracharya’s commentary. The Tika is written in the characteristic lucid style of Anandagiri, and contains some original citations from the Dramida Bhashya as well, indicating that the Dramida Bhashya was available to him.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Swami Vidyaranya: 3rd, 4th and 5th chapters of Swami Vidyaranya&rsquo;s anubhUTiprakAsha. It&rsquo;s not strictly a commentary, though. The chapters are called shvetaketuvidyA-prakAsha, sanatkumAravidyA-prakAsha and prajApatividyA-prakAsha. Pl. see Godabarisha Mishra&rsquo;s critical edition published by the Univ of Madras.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sayanacharya (Advaita): The commentary has been published on the basis of 2 manuscripts- one from Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and the other from the Oriental Research Institute at Mysore (ref. 1). The Dipika, as the commentary is called, is a very lucid paraphrase that follows the Bhasya of Sri Shankaracharya very closely. From the colophons, it is apparent that Sayana wrote this work after completing his commentary on the Samhitas of Rigveda, Samaveda and Yajurveda. In addition to Sri Samharacharya’s Bhasya, the Dipika has relied heavily on the Vaiyasika Nyayamala of Swami Bharati Tirtha, and quotes the same very frequently. In fact, the Dipika might be regarded as a very lucid gloss on the Bhasya of Sri Samkaracharya, and supplements the latter with additional quotes from a plethora of Vedic and Pauranic texts, and gives additional examples, textual analysis etc. to clarify the Upanishadic sentences. At the same time, the Dipika condenses the polemical sections of the Bhashya so that they are more comprehensible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vyasatirtha: A sub-commentary on Shri Madhvacharya’s Bhashya on the Chhandogya Upanishad, written obviously from a Dvaita Vedanta perspective. Like his other works, the sub-commentary is marked by acute fidelity to Madhvacharya’s Bhashya, and is superb for its logical acumen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vedesha Bhikshu, disciple of Vyasatirtha: ‘Padarthakaumudi’ on the Chhandogya Upanishad, from a Dvaita Vedanta perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rangaramanuja: Written from a Vishishtadvaita Vedanta perspective. Like his commentaries on most Upanishads, this is also a brief one and tries to incorporate comments on the relevant passages as far as they occur in the works of Shri Ramanujacharya. A noteworthy feature the work is that it cites all the Brahmasutras which refer to a particular passage of the Upanishad, while commenting on that passage. It is well known that the Brahmasutras do deal with only representative passages of the Upanisads and the principles enunciated in the text can be applied to many other parallel Upanisadic texts. This has been well demonstrated by Sri Rangaramanuja and he has applied the Brahmasutras profusely to arrive at a meaning of numerous passages of the Upanisads. Unfortunately, and contrary to expectations, Rangaramanuja does not give any new original citations from the Vakyagrantha or the Dramida Bhashya.</p>

<p>This Upanishad purports to be an esoteric portion of the Mahaakaala Samhita. It teaches the Viraat-dhyana in which parts of the Universe are meditated upon as different parts of the body of the Great Devi. The splendour and majesty of the latter is described in beautiful poeti terms, although the bulk of the text consists of slightly modified quotations from older metrical Upanishads, particularly the Svetasvatara. Interestingly, the opening verses state that the principal Sakhas of Atharvaveda, in serial order, are Vaaratantavi, Maunjaayani, Taarnabaindavi, Saunaki, Paippaladika and Saumantavi, and that the Upanishad belongs to all the six of them.</p>

The text gives an etymology for the name ‘Heramba’, which is a synonym for Lord Ganesha.  Thereafter, Paramesvara teaches the esoteric Heramba-tattva to Parvati. According to this teaching, Sri Ganesha is the god of gods, or the Supreme God. The text is composed in Indravajraa (Upajaati) meter.</p>

<li>Bhartrprapanca (Bhedabheda Vedanta): Was probably on Madhyandina recension of Yajurveda. No longer extant. Hiriyanna interprets a statement in Anandagiri’s gloss on Suresvara’s Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Varttika to mean that Bhartrprapanca also wrote a commentary on this Upanishad.</li>
<li>Samkaracarya (Advaita Vedanta): This is on Kanva recension of Yajurveda</li>
<li>Uvata (Vaidik commentary): This is a part of the commentary on the entire Yajurveda (Madhyandina recension). According to the colophons of this work, Uvata hailed from Anandapura in Gujarat, but wrote his commentary while living in Avanti (= Ujjain) during the reign of Raja Bhoja (996-1051 C.E.). According to some, Uvata and Kaiyata were brothers of the Kashmirian scholar Mammata, and were therefore Kashmiri Pundits. However, this view is untenable because the colophons clearly state that he was the son of Vajrata, who was from Gujarat. At the commencement of his commentary, Uvata lists the exegetical principles (<em>vyakhya dharmas</em>) that he will employ. The commentary is brief and precise.</li>

<p><strong>Netropanishad</strong>: It is the shorter version of the Caksusopanishad, that is prevalent in northern India. The Caksushopanishad exists in a slightly different version in southern India (see Aksyupanishad above). Writing at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, SCHRADER [1908:123] wrote that the text was still used in Amritsar against the diseases of the eye – eight Brahmins were called in to the house of the patient for the recitation of the text over a particular length of time.</p>

<p>**Niralamba Upanishad: <strong>The Upanishad consists of questions such as ‘Who is Brahman’, ‘Who is Paramatman’ and so on.</strong> **There are two recensions of this text – the Northern and the Southern. The Northern recensions itself exists in two versions – a shorter and a longer version. The former is published in Indische Studien, vol.XVII by Weber. The longer version is three times longer than the shorter one because the answers to the questions therein are much more complete, and are embellished with quotations from other texts. According to SCHRADER [1908 1908:207], this longer version rather looks like a commentary on the core text. It is the southern recension that is typically printed in collections of 108 Upanishads, and has a commentary on it (in manuscript) by Appayyadiksita.</p>
<p>There is even a ‘middle’ recension of the text, that is midway between the Northern and the Southern Recension.</p>

<p>The Samhitopanishad of Rgveda exists in two versions – the Aitareya version is Aranyaka III.1-2 of the Aitareya Aranyaka. There is a second version embedded in the Sankhayana Aranyaka.</p>
<p>The Samhitopanishad of Samaveda exists as a Brahmana or an Upabrahmana text titled ‘Samhitopanishad Brahmana’. This text is attached to the Kauthuma and the Ranayaniya Sakhas of Samaveda.</p>
<p>The Krshna Yajurveda has two Samhitopanishads – The Kathasiksa Upanishad (see above), and the Taittiriya Siksa Upanishad comrpsing the Siksavalli or Prapathaka VII of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. For details, see under ‘Taittiriya Upanishad’ above.</p>

<p><strong>Siddhantashikhopanishad:</strong> This text is like a Purva-tapini or a prologue to the Siddhantasaaropanishad. Like the Rudropanishad, it enjoins the necessity of devotion to Lord Shiva. The Upanishad maintains that the the manifestation or appearance of this devotion happens only when the votary wears the ashes and rudraksha beads on his persona, and therefore the text prescribes the method of wearing them. The text is in shloka meter [SCHRADER 1908:293-294].</p>
<p><strong>Siddhantasaaropanishad:</strong> SCHRADER [1908:203] says that the name is not at all appropriate to the contents of the text.</p>

<p><strong>Svasamvedyopanishad:</strong> According to SCHRADER [1908:300-301] – “This Upanishad, inspired as it seems, by the Mahayanist doctrine of vacuity (sunya-vaada), proclaims a most radical agnosticism by asserting in four chapters: (1) that there is no reincarnation (existence being bubble-like), no knowledge, no god (isvara), no world; that all traditional literature, Sruti and Smrti, is the work of conceited fools; (2) that Time the Destroyer and Nature the Originator are the rulers of all existence, but not good an bad deeds, and that there is neither hell nor heaven (nirvana); (3) that, ‘deluded by flowery speech, people cling to gods, teachers, sacred places, though there is, in reality, no difference at all between high, middle. And low, Vishnu and a dog; (4) that, though all words are untrue and all ideas mere illusions, yet liberation (jivan-mukti) is possible by a thorough realization of Bhavadvaita.”</p>

<strong>Syaamopanishad</strong>: The text is practically identical to the first 1/3 of the Kaalikopanishad.</li>

<p>**Taittiriya Upanisad: **The Atharvana version of the text lacks the first valli, as well as the section following ‘suvarNajyotiH ya evaM veda ityupanishat’.</p>
<ol>
<li>Vrtti of Kaundinya: According to Taittiriya Kandanukramani and the Grhyasutras of Apastamba, Baudhayana and Hiranykeshi, Kundin or Kaundinya wrote a Vritti on the Taittiriya texts. The nature of this vritti is not made clear, although a ‘Kaundinya Kalpa’ is mentioned in the Tantravarttika of Kumarila Bhatta. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Kaundinya indeed wrote a commentary on the Taittiriya Upanishad. The Siksha text of Kaundinya on the Taittiriya Shakha however survives and has been printed.</li>
<li>Bhashya of Guhadeva: The explanation of Guhadeva on a mantra occurring in the Taittiriya Aranyaka is quoted  in a commentary on Nirukta. Since the Vedantin Shri Ramanujacharya recalls Guhadeva as his ideological predecessor in his work ‘Vedarthasangraha’, it is often surmised that Guhadeva must have authored a commentary on the Taittiriya Upanishad. However, the evidence is clearly insufficient to warrant such a conclusion.</li>
<li>Bhashya of Kapardiswamin: He is the famous author on numerous texts of the Apastamba and Bharadvaja sub-schools of the Taittiriya Yajurveda. Although Shri Ramanujacharya remembers him as his ideological predecessor. However, he is not known to have written commentaries on any Upanishad or even on the Apastamba Dharmasutra (which has the Vedanta like Adhyatmapatala). His works do show however that he was a Vaishnava. Hence Shri Ramanujacharya invoked his authority to demonstrate that followers of Vedic religion can be Vaishnavas as well and therefore the Shri Vaishnava doctrine is not unorthodox.</li>
<li>Bhasya of Sri Shankaracharya: According to tradition, this was the first Upanishad on which Shri Shankaracharya commented because he himself belonged to the Taittiriya Shakha. The Bhashya starts with mangalacharna shlokas, which is uncharacteristic of Shankaracharya’s works. Perhaps, the tradition is indeed true and Shankaracharya intended these shlokas to be construed as the mangalacharana shlokas for all his works. In one of these shlokas, he reverentially bows to his predecessors and states that he is following their views in writing his commentary on the Upanishad. It is unclear however which predecessor he is referring to.</li>

<p>**Tejobindu: **There are two recensions of the text -</p>
<ol>
<li>The Northern Recension with the Dipika of Narayana Bhatta, son of Ratnakara Bhatta. This is a very short text of 14 verses only.</li>
<li>The Southern Recension which is much longer than the Northern Recension. This text adds 448 slokas to the Northern Recension. The first 36 slokas transfer the subject of Yoga to a more ideal plan, followed by a discourse of Lord Siva to Kumaara (Chapter II of 42 verses) on Akhandaikarsachintmatrasvarupa. The third chapter, of 74 slokas deals with Atmanubhava, and the fourth chapter, consisting if 81 slokas, deals with Jivanmukta. The fifth is an explanation to Nidaagha by Rbhu on Atmaanaatmaviveka in 105 verses. The sixth chapter, consisting of 110 verses is another Advaitic discourse by Rbhu and the text finally concludes with a warning that the great Shaiva/Shaankariya teaching should not be repeated to an unworthy person. This longer version has a commentary on it by Appayaadiksita, that exists in manuscript at Adyar [SCHRADER 1908: 187-188].</li>
</ol>
<p>**Tripuraa Upanishad: **Attributed to Sri Samkaracharya, the 3 ‘puras’ being the 3 chapters. It is a digest of the entire Upanishadic thought along Advaita lines. Other names of the text are Traipuropanishad, Tripuraamahopanishad, Srividyopanishad, and Sricaturthasatapathe Purvashatke Kaamakalopanishad. A manuscript of the text at Adyar also has Vedic accents on it.</p>

<p><strong>Tripuraasundari Upanishad:</strong> This is the same as Tripuraataapinyupanishad.</p>
<p>Tripuraatapinyupanishad: This text is commonly known as Sundaritapinyupanishad and Tripurasundaryupanishad in northern India. The text has six chapters, each of which is called an ‘Upanishad’. The first four ‘Upanishads’ are sometimes clubbed together into a ‘Purva’ Upanishad, and the last two into an ‘Uttara’ Upanishad. The last Upanishad is a very short section, often missing in manuscripts from Southern India. In some manuscripts, the six Upanishads are numbered as sixtieth to sixty fifth, perhaps in an attempt to augment the collection of fifty-two Atharvana Upanishads [SCHRADER 1908: 194]. A manuscript of a Bhashya by Appayyadiksita on the first five Upanishads exists at Adyar.</p>
<p><strong>Trisikhibrahmanopanishad:</strong> This text exists exists in two recensions – a Southern Recension, and a shorter Northern Recension that lacks verses 32b- 161 of the former [SCHRADER 1908: 197-198].

A manuscript of a Bhashya by Gopaalaashrama Yogindra is also reported<sup id="fnref:215"><a href="#fn:215" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">215</a></sup>.</p>
<p>**Tulasi Upanishad: **This Upanishad deals with the secretive power of the Tulasi plant. The Tulasi leaves are considered indespensible during the performance of sraaddhas, and the text warns that it is dangerious to pluck the leaves for any other false/non-religious purpose or at the wrong time. Manuscript at Adyar [SCHRADER 1908:ii].</p>
<p>**Turiya Upanishad: **Manuscript at Adyar [SCHRADER 1908:ii]. The text seems to have an intimate relationship with the famous Mandukya Upanishad.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The Northern recension<sup id="fnref:216"><a href="#fn:216" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">216</a></sup> is titled ‘Sri Shankaracharya’s Vajasuchyupanishad-subodhini’ in manuscript colophons and has three parts. The first part defines who is a Brahmin. The second part discusses the nature of moksa while the last part explains the Mahavakya.</p>

<p>Numerous manuscripts from this library were transferred to Vishvesharanand Vedic Research Institute (Hoshiarpur, Panjab) and subsequently to Chandigarh, but this particular manuscript does not appear to have been one of them. GUPTA did make an attempt to find more details about the manuscript from former librarians of this collection but was told that the owner of the manuscript hailed from Uttar Pradesh and was willing to show the Padapaatha of only one Ashtaka at a time. The owner refused to part with the manuscript and the Library did not make any transcript from the same.</p>
<p>Published by the Gujarat Printing Press, Bombay in 1912 [GUPTA 1967: 9].</p>
<p>The edition has numerous appendices, tables, and other useful data such as comparison of Ravana’s interpretations with those of other commentators, his grammatical analyses of Rgvedic text and so on.</p>
<p>According to Bijaganita of Bhaskara, Daivajna Pandit Surya was 31 years old when he wrote this commentary on Lilavati [GUPTA 1967: 6].</p>
<p>This adds up to 5649 mantras of the Rgveda Samhita.</p>
<p>According to Arya Samaj traditions, Swami objected to his host, the Maharaja of Jodhpur’s courtship with a Muslim prostitute named Nanjijaan. Fearing that the Swami might prevail and would succeed in getting her ousted from the Palace, she bribed Swami Dayanand’s cook, who apparently mixed a poison (or finely ground glass according to some accounts) in Swamiji’s milk, resulting in his death after a few weeks.</p>
<p>Subscribers included Max Mueller and Monier-Williams.</p>
<p>The work was reprinted several times by the Sabha, and also by other organizations such as the Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (the apex organization of Arya Samaj). The initial portion of the commentary was published with extensive annotations and footnotes by Ramlal Kapoor Trust. Arsha Sahitya Prachar Trust translated the Sanskrit text of the initial portion of the commentary into Hindi afresh (since the Hindi translation of the original translators is not very polished, and sometimes deviates from the Sanskrit text) and published it in two volumes, which contain approximately 35 initial hymns of Rgveda.</p>
<p>He permitted patrons to buy the Introduction separately from the commentary however.</p>
<p>According to Swamiji, the RV, YV, SV and AV were respectively revealed to Sages Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Angira. He rejected the traditional view that the four Vedas initially constituted one book that was divided into four parts by Veda Vyasa.</p>
<p>His complete commentary on the entire Yajurveda (Madhyandina) Samhita also survives and has been published several times.</p>
<p>However, for the first five adhyaayas of the Samhita, the topics are given for each individual anuvaaka, not for each varga.</p>

<p>Historically however, other schools of Hindu philosophy, such as Samkhya and Vaiseshika, have also traced their doctrines in these texts.</p>
<p>These 10 Upanishads are: Isa, Katha, Kena, Mundaka, Mandukya, Prasna, Chhandogya, Brhadaranyaka, Aitareya and Taittiriya. Very often, the following texts are added to this list of the most hallowed Upanishads – Kausitaki, Maitrayaniya and Svetasvatara.</p>
<p>For instance, the Garuda Upanishad.</p>
<p>A listing of the Upanishads, such as the present paper, is somewhat difficult because different texts are often known by the same name, while the same text might have several different names. In many cases, a particular section(s) of one text is classed as a separate text. The reader will encounter examples of all these scenarios in this paper.</p>
<p>This is important, because the same Upanishad often exists in multiple recensions having a few or several differences amongst them.</p>
<p>For instance, the Narayana Upanishad is classified as a ‘Vaishnava Upanishad’, the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is classified under ‘Older Upanishads’ and so on.</p>
<p>Ed. by Pandit Damodara Satavakelara, published by the Swadhyaya Mandala (dist. Valsad, Gujarat). Numerous reprints of this text have appeared, and the one used by me is dt.</p>
<p>VSM edition</p>
<p>Again, the editions by Damodara Satavalekara were used.</p>
<p>This Samhita has still not been published satisfactorily. It comprises of 20 books (called ‘kandas’). For kandas I-XV, I have used the edition of Dipankar Bhattacharya (1997, Asiatic Society of Bengal: Calcutta). For the remaining five kandas, comprising more than half the Samhita, the devanagari script edition by Raghuvira (Asha Sahitya Prachar Trust: Delhi</p>
<p>For e.g., of the 1875 mantras in the Kauthuma Samhita of Samaveda, 1800 are found in the Rgveda Samhita. The originality of Samaveda lies in its sacred melodies (samans), which cannot be ‘described’ like here as one would describe a spiritual text.</p>
<p>The extant Samhitas are: Taittiriya, Maitrayaniya, Kathaka and the fragmentary Kapishthala Samhita.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize here that there is no clear distinction between ‘ritual’ and ‘spirituality’ (or ‘karmakanda’ and ‘brahmakanda’) in the Vedic texts. Many portions of the Upanishads are quite ritualistic, while the ritualistic Vedic Samhitas and Brahmanas have ‘spiritual’ ideas scattered in them.</p>
<p>In fact, the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad itself is the concluding portion of the Satapatha Brahmana. Earlier books of the Satapatha (for instance Kanda X in the Madhyandina version of Satapatha Brahmana) also contains very long sections resembling Upanishads.</p>
<p>E.g., the initial sections of Jaiminiya Brahmana and the concluding sections of Taittiriya Brahmana, long sections of the Gopatha Brahmana etc.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Paippalada Samhita appears to be a precursor to all these cosmogonical sections of the Brahmanas.</p>
<p><em>Dharmakosa, Upanisatkanda</em>, Volume II, Part I. 1950. Ed. by Tarkateerth Lakshmanshastri Joshi. Prajna Pathasala Mandala: Wai (Maharashtra)</p>
<p>E.g. Louis RENOU, P. DEUSSEN, L. SCHERMAN [1887]</p>
<p>A particularly large number of lost ‘srutis’, often with an Upanishadic quality about them, are found quoted in the works of the pre-eminent Dvaita Vedanta teacher Sri Madhvacharya. His critics have alleged that many of these ‘srutis’ are the teacher’s own fabrications. I personally do not subscribe to these allegations against him. The omission of texts cited by him will be made up for in a later edition of this paper after I have devoted some thought to this question.</p>
