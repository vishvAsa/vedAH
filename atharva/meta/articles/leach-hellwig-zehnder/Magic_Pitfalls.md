**Believing in Magic and Other Pitfalls **

**with Interpreting the Atharvaveda**

**Abstract:** Both recensions of the Atharvaveda contain extensive information on the liturgical resources that poet-priests could use to perform lifecycle rites marking birth, puberty, marriage, and death; rites for making protective amulets and tal-ismanic armor; apotropaic rites for overcoming destructive or demonic forces; 

and rites for healing wounds, fever, diseases, and other ailments. As such, the 

Atharvaveda  is a voluminous source for understanding various ideals, values, and practices of ancient Indians. Unfortunately, over the past 150 years, European and American scholars have uniformly interpreted the Atharvaveda  as a text inherently containing magical rituals. Even today, it is common for conference papers 

to feature code words for magic in their titles \(“medicinal magic,” “magical,” 

“spell,” “charm,” “sorcery,” “incantation,” etc.\). This interpretative stance suggests that Vedic scholars still uncritically accept magic as a natural category of human behavior. Unfortunately, magic is above all a theoretical category with serious, 

if not bankrupt analytical conclusions about human motivations and behavior. 

What is more, the Atharvaveda  played a central role in the development of the various theories of magic at the turn of the twentieth century, and this convoluted hermeneutical process negatively shaped our interpretation of the text. Since the broad concept of magic has fallen out of favor in the past three to four decades 

in the social sciences and humanities, this paper will challenge Vedic scholars to abandon it wholesale in favor of contemporary theories for understanding human 

behavior. This paper will thus highlight some generalizable and unifying theoret-

ical ways to understand the hymns and rituals represented in the Atharvaveda, especially in terms of agency, performance, and identity formation. As a case 

study, the paper will examine a specific type of ritualized discourse whereby early Vedic ritualists lengthen their lives and the lives of their patrons. 

Magic is a dangerous word, more dangerous than magic itself, because it is such a handsome term to cover everything that we fail to understand. The term is used far too often as a vague kind of explanation, but in fact it explains nothing. – Jan van Baal \(1971: 55\) Open Access. © 2025 the author\(s\), published by De Gruyter.

**1  Introduction**

The Atharvaveda contains extensive information on the liturgical resources ancient Indian priests can employ to perform a host of rituals. Both recensions of the text include hymns for use in lifecycle rites marking birth, puberty, marriage, and death; rites for educating and protecting priests; for praising gods and other abstract concepts; for acquiring a partner or making protective amulets; for gaining wealth, 

knowledge, and prestige; for overcoming destructive or demonic forces; and for 

healing wounds, fever, diseases, and other ailments. The Atharvaveda is an invaluable source for understanding numerous values, practices, and ideals of ancient 

Indians who performed its rituals, patronized its specialists, and moved within the wider Vedic world circa 1000 BCE. 

There is unfortunately a systemic problem in Vedic scholarship with under-

standing the Atharvaveda. Over the past 150 years or so, Western scholars have almost uniformly interpreted the text as containing magical rites.1 In fact, it is frequently defined as ancient India’s magical text par excellence. This view persists in recent scholarship on the text. For example, in his book The Roots of Hinduism \(2015\), Asko Parpola reproduces with little critical reflection the same ideas about magic, sorcery, and witchcraft in the Atharvaveda that date back a century or more \(pp. 130–133\).2 In a similar vein, it is commonplace for conferences on ancient 

India to include multiple papers on the Atharvaveda that feature code words for magic in their titles \(“spell,” “charm,” “sorcery,” “incantation,” etc.\). My intention here is not to critique wholesale the value of the scholars’ contributions, which are important for understanding the Atharvaveda, but simply to draw attention to the fact that the analytical category of magic stills persists in contemporary scholarship with little critical reflection. 

The ubiquitous invocation of magic to explain Atharvavedic rituals – and all 

Vedic rituals for that matter – indicates that scholars still accept magic as a natural category of human behavior. Scholars utilize the concept with little critical reflection as if it is a settled method for describing ritual behavior and the quality of its practitioners’ mindset. It is also telling that Vedic scholars rarely cite the exact theories of magic that inform their interpretations. The problem here is that when scholars invoke magic as an explanatory device they all too often fail to recognize that magic is above all a theoretical category that originated around the turn of the 20th century in Western intellectual circles in which the Atharvaveda played a **1** For a survey, see Patton 2005: 38–44.

significant role.3 The concept of magic was not invented at this point \(more below\), but the way cultural historians and textual anthropologists use it was. 

Furthermore, the normalizing of magic ignores the fact that the category was 

hotly contested for over a hundred years with absolutely no settled agreement 

among scholars on how to understand it or if it was worth using in the first place. 

From roughly 1880 to 1980, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, histori-

ans, theologians, and even Sanskritists argued over the definition of magic, which was set in stark contrast with religion and science \(with unsuccessful attempts to reconcile the non-scientific concepts into the equally problematic modifier “magico-religious”\).4 With colonial certainty, social evolutionary theory, and the scientific rationalism of modernity, many of these thinkers systematically classified the behaviors and beliefs of non-Western peoples or non-educated Europeans as “less 

than” – as overly emotional, irrational, childlike, or primitive. At its heart, magic was false, mistaken, or misguided belief. To illustrate, in a patronizing tone, E. B. 

Tylor \(1871: 101\) judges the belief in magic to be “one of the most pernicious delu-sions that ever vexed mankind.” As one of its early and most influential theorists, James Frazer \(1922: 11\) articulates a similar condescending view: “. . . magic is a spurious system of natural law as well as a fallacious guide of conduct; it is a false science as well as an abortive art.” In other words, people who practice magic are immoral and erroneously attempt to transcend nature through misguided laws of 

sympathetic association;5 or they use those laws to acquire metaphysical power 

\(aka mana\);6 or such practices serve to alleviate anxiety in times of crisis \(aka cathartic wish-fulfilment\).7

From the outset, it is important to state that the concept of magic has been 

deployed historically in three ways. According to Jens Braarvig \(1999: 30\), magic was first used as an emic “intra-textual” term for internal practices in ancient 

Greek culture \(although it was frequently used to deprecate the practices of for-

**3** For example, the Atharvaveda was used to justify the theories of scholars like Marcel Mauss and Rudolf Otto, both of whom were trained Sanskritists. In addition, James Frazer \(1922: 67\) utilized the work of Hermann Oldenberg, who in turn was influenced by Mauss, Otto, and Frazer in developing his theory of Vedic magic as “prescientific science” \(1919\). 

**4** See e.g. Thite \(2003: 131\), who states “The Weltanschaung of the Vedic texts is magicoreligious rather than scientific.” Cf. Thite 1982. For a critique of this viewpoint in the study of ancient Indian medicine, see Engler 2003. 

**5** Frazer 1922. 

**6** Mauss 1972 \[1904\]. Oldenberg \(1919: 129ff.\) argues that Vedic rituals were ultimately concerned with the acquisition and increase of magical power. 

**7** Malinowski 1955 \[1925\]. As a counter example, Evans-Pritchard \(1929, 1937\) expresses skepti-cism about the universal application of the concept of magic and argues for contextual analysis over general theories.

eigners\).8 Second, Christians deployed it throughout history as an “inter-textual” 

term for unchristian practices deemed abhorrent.9 In Daniel Dubuisson’s \(2016: 1\) forceful words:

it is the Church, in the first place, as an organ of power, that came up with the malevolent, demonic conception of magic, in order to make of it its titled adversary as a living antithesis to religion. This means that its clerics created a “figure” that was quite original but entirely negative, which they disfigured and mutilated. 

Finally, scholars used it as an “extra-textual” theoretical term to categorize types of behavior and belief that they deemed to fall outside the categories religion and science \(Braarvig 1999: 30\). In the last case, it is crucial to disrupt the space between the assumption that magic is a natural or universal category, on the one hand, and its scholarly creation, on the other. In other words, we should always differentiate between how ancient Indians would have understood their own concepts and 

practices \(aka the emic level\) and the theoretical impositions we employ to translate them \(aka the etic level\). We must therefore assess the worth of theorists and their theories, especially those we have all too readily naturalized, as a matter of course.10

The point should be self-evident but unfortunately needs repeating. The the-

oretical concept of magic has always been laden with fraught ethnocentric biases, as well as highly questionable conclusions about human psychology, behavior, and 

motivations. As Stanley Tambiah \(1990\) points out, scholars turned magic into a 

universal analytical category to underscore the superiority and civilized nature of Western European cultures. In a book-length study, Randall Styers \(2004\) unravels the theoretical history of the concept, while tracing its negative impact on 

our understanding of various cultural practices and ideas. He argues that magic 

persists as a hermeneutical category because it functions to offset and define the categories religion and science, often by exclusion or opposition. At its heart, it **8** For a critical examination of the use of the term mageia as a discursive category in ancient Greece, see Stratton 2007. 

**9** See Rage and Rider 2019. 

**10** Cf. Dubuisson 2016: 28–30. In the case of ancient India, consider the term abhicāra, which scholars all too often translate as “black magic, sorcery.” This translation readily envelopes the term into a hermeneutical history distinct from its contextual use since abhicāra literally means “hostile move, aggressive rite” \(from abhí √ car “to move against, attack”\) and the tradition glosses it as hiṃsākarman or “harmful rite” \( Amarakoṣa 3.2.265\). To my mind, there is a significant difference between recognizing that some Vedic rituals are designed to harm \(think of modern political attack ads\) and interpreting such practices as evidence of sorcery or black magic. Indeed, the very notions of “white” and “black” magic carry problematic, if not racist undertones. See Grambo 1975: 82. Cf. 

MacDonald 1984–1986: 89 and 1995: 144–145. 

Believing in Magic and Other Pitfalls with Interpreting the Atharvaveda **235**

is a polemical concept. In addition, magic served as a foil for modernity, which 

emphasized science and rationality. Consequently, cultures that practice magic 

were classed as thoroughly non-modern and an anathema to the West’s intellectual 

and moral agenda. In this sense, magic reflects Western, Christian, and colonial 

ideals that define themselves in juxtaposition with an irrational and non-scientific other. In the words of Jonathan Z. Smith \(2004: 218\), the concept of magic creates a “shadow reality” that can only be defined by “the reflection of its opposite \(‘religion,’ ‘science’\) in a distorting fun-house mirror.” 

In the 1970s and 1980s, a major shift occurred as the concept of magic was all 

but expunged from the interpretative lexicon of ethnographers and social theo-

rists due to its historical baggage. In contemporary social science theory, it is rare to see the concept discussed with any sincerity. We should take seriously Edmund 

Leach’s \(1982: 133\) assessment that “after a lifetime’s career as a professional 

anthropologist, I have almost reached the conclusion that the word \[magic\] has 

no meaning whatsoever.” In my opinion, scholars have successfully replaced the 

concept with ritual because in truth “magical acts are ritual acts” \(Tambiah 1985: 60\), and the field of ritual studies offers fruitful ways to analyze human behavior in terms of embodied performance, discourse analysis, and the politics of ritualiza-tion, broadly put.11 As Catherine Bell \(1992: 6\) aptly observes, “ritual has replaced terms such as ‘liturgy’ versus ‘magic’, which were used to distinguish high religion from primitive superstition or our ritual from theirs.” Bell’s point underscores an unavoidable problem with the concept: magic is what “they” do. It has always been used to qualify the behaviors of people coded in negative terms: as foreign, weak, immoral, primitive, ignorant, and in league with the devil or other corrupt forces. 

The point here is that from a theoretical perspective, the concept of magic 

does not explain human behavior in a sophisticated manner, nor does it take into 

account the complex discursive worlds that people inhabit and the ways that 

such discourse inhabits and speaks through them. It is also not generalizable to 

the widest possible cultural or historical contexts, which is a hallmark of sound theory. Let me demonstrate this last point through a few hypothetical scenarios. 

If the theories of magic have any cross-cultural utility, we should be able to apply them fruitfully to modern advertising campaigns, political attacks ads, digital 

bullying, or calls for conference presentations.12 Through complex metaphorical 

and metonymic analogies \(though not as simple as Frazer’s sympathetic laws\) and 

through historically institutionalized values, each one of these practices is designed **11** For in-depth consideration of this issue, see Thomassen 1999.

to influence how people behave and how they should think about the behavior of 

others. As Barry Stephenson \(2015: 68\) observes “One way of defining magic is as 

the use of symbolic means to produce empirical effects. In this sense, magic is not restricted to ‘traditional’ or ‘primitive’ societies but is at work in the modern West, too: advertising ought to be proof of that.” I suspect however that it would sound silly to talk about attack ads as dark spells aimed at destroying political careers; or internet trolls as modern-day sorcerers hurling curses at their enemies; or advertising campaigns as charms designed to instill consumers with desire. I am also 

sure academics would dislike thinking that an acceptance of a paper magically safeguards their livelihood, or that they wear protective talismans around their necks at conferences to radiate their power and privilege, while warding off hotel security. If the most basic definition of magic is a ritual designed to achieve a goal, then we perform magical rites every day.13 Democracies are truly founded on the magic 

of voting, although the COVID-19 pandemic has counteracted the magic of hand-

shaking. What is more, the phrase “you’re fired\!” carries a magical force unlike any other in the capitalist world, and the thaumaturgic power of “I now pronounce you married” can have everlasting effects.14 If magic is a ritual that attempts to flout the laws of nature, then by implication all failed scientific experiments are examples of magic. This would also include the use of many nutritional supplements, exercise fads, and other health regimes. If magic is a ritual that attempts to influence the world through harnessing supernatural power, then all religious practices that invoke non-empirical realities for specific ends are forms of magic. I doubt modern day Christians \(or any religious person\) would appreciate this conclusion.15 Finally, if we reduce magic to discrete, almost pathological, analogical thinking \(so James Frazer\), then what form of human thought is not magical?16 As Douglas Hofstadter \(2007\) cogently argues, cognition cannot happen without complex analogical 

**13** The idea that magical practices reflect primitive, non-modern, irrational attempts to influence or overcome natural laws \(killing enemies, healing diseases, securing love, expelling misfortune, etc.\) are rampant throughout early theories. For example, luminaries like Tylor \(1871\), Frazer \(1922\), Mauss \(1972 \[1904\]\), and Malinkowski \(1955 \[1925\]\) all conclude in varying degrees that magic is a kind of false pseudo-science that seeks to achieve specific yet impossible goals.

For a sustained critique of Frazer’s theory of magic, see Evans-Pritchard’s 1933, 1965, Wax and Wax 1963, and Beattie 1971.

processes at various neurobiological, syntactic, grammatical, semantic, and sym-

bolic levels. The human brain makes analogies ceaselessly, relentlessly, and for the most part unconsciously at various levels of recursive abstraction. In Hofstadter’s words, analogy is the “motor of the car of thought” and “the interstate freeway of cognition”: it is the “fuel and fire of thinking.”17 Finally, Yuval Noah Harari \(2015: 31\) nicely corroborates my heuristic assumption about the similarities of human 

behavior cross-culturally:18

People easily acknowledge that “primitive tribes” cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Take for example the world of business corporations. Modern business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales. 

The serious issues outlined above represent some, but not all, of the unavoidable problems with the concept of magic. It cannot do the theoretical work we need it 

to do to explain Vedic ritual behavior in a sophisticated manner because it cannot do the same work to explain why I am writing this paper, yet both practices have 

more in common than we are comfortable admitting. Both practices are public 

performances that marshal expert knowledge and training to convey an author-

itative position that is designed to shape the quality of professional and interpersonal relationships for socioeconomic and political ends. I work my wizardry on a podium and with a keyboard, Vedic poets on a ritual fire and with hymns. What is 

more, magic reflects a history of ethnocentric and condescending perspectives. To put it differently, after 25 years of reading Sanskrit texts and thinking about early Vedic ritual culture, and equally reading just about everything I can get my hands on relating to magic, I have concluded that the concept of magic is analytically

bankrupt. Unlike the concept of religion, which has undergone a critical reassessment in the field of religious studies in the past few decades,19 the concept of magic is unsalvageable as a theoretical category.20 As far as I can tell, the interpretative utility of the concept cannot be divorced from its hermeneutic legacy and the negative baggage it brings to bear.21

My assessment is not radical by any means since Jonathan Z. Smith \(2004\) 

argues that magic should be jettisoned as an analytical category because it is val-ue-laden, ambiguous, and insufficiently neutral. In a similar tone, Wouter Hane-

graaff \(2012: 157\) states that magic and its synonym superstition are “wholly 

unsuitable as neutral instruments in scholarly interpretation: they belong to the category of value judgments and political Kampfbegriff \(battle concepts\), not of valid ‘etic’ terminology.” In Vedic scholarship, several scholars have drawn similar conclusions. Laurie Patton \(2005\) argues that the concept of magic has been used 

in dubious, reductive, and unfruitful ways. Its use has prevented scholars from 

seeing the complex sociopolitical structures and epistemologies that Vedic ritualists negotiate and reinterpret. Drawing on theories from performance studies and 

cognitive linguistics, Patton argues that the goals of Vedic rituals and hymns should not be interpreted as magical in nature but as a forms of performative metonymical thinking or associational thought that connects an individual’s sense of themselves – their body, memories, and desires – with communal, moral, and existential realities. Signe Cohen \(2020\) has recently surveyed the problems with magic and 

concluded that it is “an inadequate hermeneutic category” to understand Athar-

vavedic hymns. She argues that three so-called “women’s love spells” in the Atharvaveda \(AVŚ.6.130–132\) are better understood as particular forms of ritualized discourse as exhibited by the interconnected meanings of the term smará, which is used repeatedly in the hymns to mean “memory,” “desire,” and “efficacious ritual 

speech.” In this regard, the hymns function as “powerful utterances that ritually transform memory and desire into social reality.” Lastly, in several of my own publications, I have gone to lengths to explain Vedic ritual practices in complex ways that other scholars have explained away as magic \(aka false belief\).22

**19** See McCutcheon 1997, Fitzgerald 2000, Masuzawa 2005, and Schilbrack 2010. 

**20** It is certainly a viable concept to examine at the emic, discursive level in ancient Greek culture, medieval Christianity, or Neopaganism. See respectively Stratton 2007, Otto 2019, and Styers 2004: 214–215 \(neo-pagan movements use the term magic in a positive yet countercultural sense\).

**2  The Problem with Belief**

For the rest of this paper, I want to focus on one of the inescapable problems with the concept of magic. Questions about the cognitive capabilities of people who \(are deemed to\) practice magic have always been central to its history. So much so that debates over the rationality of magic – whether its practitioners are irrational because they believe what they do works – culminates in several edited volumes in the 1970s and 80s with titles like Rationality or Rationality: The Critical View.23 Let me glibly summarize the conclusions of these works: people who perform magic 

are rational by their own standards, but are not rational by our own. I find this conclusion less than satisfying as if the vast majority of people, no matter where or when they live, are concerned with the logical criteria of analytical philosophers. 

As John Beattie \(1971: 245\) rightly observes, when people perform magic, they are 

“performing a rite, not applying laws of nature, however dimly apprehended.” Sim-

ilarly, Nicole Belmont \(1982: 18\) criticizes Tylor and Frazer’s insistence that magic is false science: “. . . for agrarian rituals exist alongside agrarian techniques. People must therefore have been perfectly capable of telling technical effectiveness from magical effectiveness.”24 Finally, Pierre Bourdieu \(1977: 115\) offers us a weighty observation on the logic behind traditional rituals:

Rites take place because and only because they find their raison d’être in the conditions of existence and dispositions of agents who cannot afford the luxury of logical speculation, mystical effusions, or metaphysical anxiety. It is not sufficient to ridicule the more naive forms of functionalism in order to have done with the question of the practical function of practice . . . 

But, contrary to appearances, scarcely more understanding is derived from a structural analysis which ignores the specific functions of ritual practices and fails to inquire into the economic and social conditions of the production of the dispositions generating both these practices and also the collective definition of the practical functions in whose service they function. 

Such arguments have not however undermined the consensus that magic is the 

domain of the irrational and its practice signifies an inferior mental state. For example, in a passing assessment of the concept, George Thompson \(2008: xxvii\) 

defines Vedic ritual ideology, which utilizes complex sets of metaphorical and 

**23** See Wilson 1971, Horton and Finnegan 1973, Hollis and Lukes 1982, and Agassi and Jarvie 1987. 

For criticism of the use of the word “rational” in these debates, see Buchowski 1986 and Banner 1990. 

**24** Barnes \(1979: 119\) points out that magic practitioners readily defend their endeavors based on legitimate scientific knowledge. See also Grambo \(1975\) for a rich consideration of ways to understand magical practices.

metonymic analogies, as magical thinking.25 For Thompson, its underlying logic is easy to understand if one reads Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking \(2005\) wherein the author narrates the mental and emotional ways in which she dealt 

with her husband’s sudden death and her daughter’s life-threatening illness. She 

describes the process as a kind of insanity \(so “magical thinking”\) since she tries to overcome unavoidable events by sheer willpower or repetitive ritual acts.26 If we apply this model wholesale to Vedic ritual epistemology, are we to conclude that 

ancient Indians suffer from a similar mental condition, or to paraphrase Thompson, anguished bouts of magical thinking?27 Unfortunately, over the past twenty years at conferences or seminars, I have heard colleagues articulate a version of this senti-ment; namely, that magic represents a form of mistaken belief. That is to say, when I press scholars on their use of the term magic, and why ancient Indians are ritually doing what they do – and saying what they do will do what they say – I often hear some version of “because they believe in it.” \(I also get the sense that when scholars code practices or beliefs as magical, often as an afterthought, they do so as short-hand for “I don’t know why these people think this works. It seems silly to me, but clearly magic explains it all.”\) In the face of physical laws, lived experience, and complex discursive ideals and sociopolitical structures that ancient Indians would have negotiated on a daily basis, the implication is clear: they are to some degree misguided, irrational, or primitive.28 This conclusion is distressing because, as a Vedic scholar, I care deeply about how we represent people who lived thousands of years ago in north India. It is also troubling because ancient Indians are anatom-ically modern human beings with the exact cognitive capabilities to understand 

their world as any contemporary scholar of ancient India. It is not good enough for trained scholars to explain away the actions and ideas of people as irrational – as **25** In Vedic scholarship, it is common for scholars to define magic as symbolic or analogical thinking. While this conclusion is not wrong, it often goes undertheorized and stands for false belief. 

In contrast, see Witzel \(1979\), who presents a critical assessment of Vedic ritual epistemology, yet retains the concept of magic. 

**26** For a psychological analysis of this phenomenon, see Vyse 1997. 

**27** In relation to its medieval use, Kieckhefer \(2019\) recognizes that magic is a general ambiguous 

“aggregating term,” constituted by various individual and contextually specific practices. Unfortunately, in terms of why people think what they do magically will be efficacious, Keickhefer invokes Freud’s notion of an infantile confusion of will with reality \(18\). 

**28** For an illustrative version of this conclusion, see Bloomfield \(1899: 61\), who clarifies practitioners of the Atharvaveda as “. . . the natural semi-civilized man; rapacious, demon- and fear-rid-den, hateful, lustful, addicted to sorcery.” As Cohen \(2020: 8\) notes, “Modern scholars will distance themselves from Bloomfield’s pejorative characterization of the Atharvaveda and of Vedic practitioners, but the distinction between religion and magic still lingers in recent work on South Asian religions.” 

Believing in Magic and Other Pitfalls with Interpreting the Atharvaveda **241**

magical – because they have failed to do the work to make such practices intelligible, meaningful, and ultimately rational in conventional terms. This interpretative strategy is the last resort of the uncritical. In this sense, magic and its adjective magical are just placeholders for further but unfurnished explanations.29

According to Catherine Bell \(1992: 115\), our primary question should not focus 

on how rituals do what people say they do, at least at a discrete literal level, but how each particular ritual is judged to be the appropriate activity to do in its specific context. This question illuminates the complex ways that people enact ritualized 

behavior to distinguish what they are doing as the best or right way to navigate 

particular dynamics of social empowerment over and against other potential ways 

of acting. In this vein, the literal goals of many rituals reflect a form of misrecognition in which people manage social relationships, economic realities, and political positions – or “schemes of privileged opposition” \(98\) – by metaphorically aligning them with ethical ideals, natural processes, and metaphysical truths.30 As Jonathan Z. Smith \(1982: 64–65\) argues, rituals are supposed to be unlike reality or at least they create their own meta-reality. Rituals take place within predictable, even 

artificial, social arenas in which the potential exists for all the variables of life to be symbolically “factored out”; rituals are \(often\) unlike the hustle and bustle of everyday life.31 This sheds some light on ritual practices that have been \(unfortunately\) deemed magical since anything is possible – at least, can be claimed to be possible – within the symbolically charged, ritualized, and “perfected” world of 

ritual performances. Conversely, such practices reflect a “realistic assessment” that rituals cannot literally do what people claim. In a more nuanced vein, William Sax \( et al.  2010\) argues that debates over the efficacy of rituals have always played a major role in any social or historical context and reveal a level of complexity and sophistication that scholars often overlook. Bourdieu \(1977: 116\) offers us another powerful observation in this regard when he argues that the metonymic relationships set up between humans, their desires, and the physical or supernatural 

world serve to foster specific and imitative modes of ritual and practical behavior or “mimesis.” Bourdieu highlights this point by referring to a fertility rite, which connects cooking grain, pregnancy, and germination. Andrew Strathern \(1996: 28\) 

clarifies Bourdieu’s point by citing an example from the fieldwork of Bronislaw

\[W\]hen a Trobriand garden magician mimics the actions of yams growing in a garden and says, “The belly of my garden swells,” he transfers the scheme of pregnancy in the human body over to the scheme of garden fertility, thereby setting up a correspondence that reener-gizes both contexts . . . What is involved here is not just symbolic action based on metaphor but also the bringing together of two separate spheres, which thereby become cosmically fused. 

The point here is that a narrow focus on assessing \(or dismissing\) the literal veracity of any claim will overlook the complex sociopolitical relationships, discursive ideals, embodied dispositions, and metaphysical concepts that people consistently negotiate though ritualized acts. What is more, such practices may come with serious consequences. Consider the example presented by Michael Brown \(1989\), who underscores 

the deadly outcomes of performing shamanic rituals among the Aguaruna people in 

Peru. He describes a situation in which a local shaman-healer called Yankush was 

compelled to name the sorcerer who was suspected of killing an elderly villager, who had suddenly died. The shaman did so through a drug-induced vision and his fellow villagers subsequently killed the accused man. In Brown’s \(172\) words, 

Because Yankush was widely known to have fingered the sorcerer, he became the likely victim of a reprisal raid by members of the murdered man’s family. Yankush’s willingness to accept the risk in order to protect his community from future acts of sorcery was a source of his social prestige, but it was also a burden. I rarely saw him leave his house without a loaded shotgun. 

Vedic scholars could adopt a similar awareness of the complex social, economic, 

and political relationships that underlie any Atharvavedic ritual. We could call it the “shotgun rule.” As Brown aptly concludes, “Belief in sorcery . . . may provide a system of rules and punishments in societies that lack a police force, written laws, and formal judicial system.” In this vein, Pamela Stewart and Andrew Strathern 

\(2004\) have lucidly theorized the causal relationship between rumors and gossip and practices called “witchcraft” and “sorcery.” In their words, “Rumor and gossip . . . 

are less a means of resolving disputes than a method of exacerbating tensions 

between people that can lead to the persecution of particular individuals perceived as being weak.” \(23\) Accusations of sorcery or witchcraft thus reflect cultural, economic, or political changes that can lead to the redistribution of resources or even violence against accused groups. My point here is not to endorse the general use 

of the concept of sorcery, which frequently functions as a code word for magic 

or at minimum dovetails with it. I prefer the use of emic terms and categories as much as possible. We should only impose etic concepts if their utility is generalizable and informative to the widest cultural contexts. Nevertheless, Brown, Stewart, and Strathern underscore the imperative to analyze critically the ways in which 

ritualized hate speech \(“sorcery” by another name\) operates within and reflects 

complex lived sociopolitical worlds. The overwrought and violent language of the 

Believing in Magic and Other Pitfalls with Interpreting the Atharvaveda **243**

Atharvaveda, like the R̥gveda, underscores the serious nature of the kinds of relationships early Vedic ritualists may be negotiating. Atharvavedic specialists may be concerned with controlling the narrative ritually to avoid being perceived as 

performing nefarious acts, or at least walking a fine line between legitimate and illegitimate ways of ritually engaging their community. Consequently, Atharvavedic ritualists can be seen as professional negotiators of communal well-being and identity, yet their ritualized acts would have been embedded in tense social relationships with fraught interpersonal meanings and potentially deadly consequences. 

**3  Case Study**

This brings us back to what I perceive to be the overriding and inescapable flaw 

with the concept of magic; namely, that it always implies false belief to some 

degree. This is painfully evident in contemporary English as the common seman-

tic associations of magic signify something that is extraordinary, unbelievable, 

miraculous, beyond physics, even impossible, if not farcical. These connotations 

underlie the success of the category as a means of entertainment and its explosion in genres such as theater, novels, games, television, and movies. In short, magic sells. I suspect this is because magic creates an exciting form of escapism from the mundane world and allows for open-ended and fantastic world building. It also 

serves as a convenient way to shortcut character development and plot lines. As 

such, it functions as a cheap, yet compelling narrative device that can generate 

billions in revenue by gathering a legion of followers who want to be exhilarated by imaginative things.32 In the modern world, magic is however still fiction. By its very nature, it represents a form of false belief in the face of cold hard science \(or perhaps it merely requires a childlike mindset to participate\). If someone cannot or will not differentiate between the two realms, we can readily diagnose them as suffering from “magical thinking,” which signals a fatal flaw in someone’s logic 

or understanding of reality. At this level, magical thinking is just another way of saying someone is irrational, if not crazy. 

How then are we to understand the mindset of individuals who perform Vedic 

rituals and claim that they do things that rituals simply cannot do, at least not literally? For the rest of this paper, I would like to repurpose some of my conclu-

sions from my article on lengthening life in early Vedic rituals \(Whitaker 2011\). 

The R̥gveda and Atharvaveda are replete with statements in which a poet-priest lengthens the life of his patron, his community, and himself through his hymn and **32** Cf. Styers 2004: 121–217 on why magic persists in contemporary society.

the power of various gods. Poets typically express the desire for a long life, ideally for one hundred autumns, through the formula prá √ tr̥̄ ā́yus \(“to lengthen life”\) or a similar expression. For example \(translations mine\):

These stanzas were most likely sung in elaborate public rituals for wealthy patrons or in personal rites in which an amulet was bound on such individuals. We can 

clearly see the overlapping relationships between poet-priests, gods, and patrons, especially the desire for a long life, wealth, and others forms of social capital. In **33** For in-depth discussion on the meaning of the term ásu \(“life, vital force, soul”\), see Preisendanz 2005. 

Believing in Magic and Other Pitfalls with Interpreting the Atharvaveda **245**

my own words \(Whitaker 2004: 577\), the ritualized creation of amulets reflects 

“a socio-religious exchange between elite ritually trained agents, their sources, and the recipients of symbolic capital, which highlights a dialectic of human relationships revealed in cosmological, ontological, and socio-political realms.” 

In terms of the goal to lengthen life, Ruprecht Geib \(1975\) offers an illustrative interpretation in relation to magic as he explains ancient Indians’ desire for a long life in reductive psychological terms. That is to say, Vedic priests implicitly fear dying and use their rituals to lengthen their lives as a way to relieve their worries about perishing young, or death in general. Geib’s conclusion owes its underlying reasoning to Bronislaw Malinowski \(1955 \[1925\]\), who was one of the paragons 

in the history of the interpretation of magic. Malinowski reduces ritual practices \(aka magic\) to a psychological device that alleviates stress and anxiety in times of uncertainty or danger. In this vein, the formula prá √ tr̥̄ ā́yus \(“to lengthen life”\) reflects an early Vedic form of cathartic wish-fulfilment. Mary Douglas \(1966: 59\) rightly criticizes Malinowski’s presentation of magical practices as “a kind of poor man’s whiskey, used for gaining conviviality and courage against daunting odds.” 

The point here is that it is highly unlikely that ancient Indians were wracked with anxiety every time they performed rituals. As Jan van Baal \(1971: 69\) observes, pre-industrial people “know as well as we do that a wish is not fulfilled by wishing more ardently . . .”, and in a mocking tone toward Malinowski’s theory about garden 

magic, “. . . fair words butter no parsnips.” While we could question whether people always exercise such knowledge, a Malinowskian interpretation of ritual efficacy 

fails to explain the complex discursive factors and relationships – symbolic, social, economic, and political – that give value and meaning to why early Vedic people 

sought to lengthen their lives through ritual practices.34

In my 2011 article, I concluded that the formula for lengthening life in ancient 

India reflects a particular ritualized way of talking and acting – a discursive 

strategy – wherein Vedic priests and patrons align themselves with institutional 

expectations and demonstrate performatively their commitment to participate in 

rituals throughout their entire lives. This conclusion allowed me to speculate on some of the underlying social and ritual processes implicit in the use of the term 

“life” \( ā́yus\). In particular, I asked the question: did ancient Indians believe that they could lengthen their lives through performing rituals? It is plausible to conclude that some people may very well have accepted this claim without doubt and 

with absolute conviction, as true and real, if this is what we mean by “believe.” 

Nevertheless, if we draw on the work of Michel Foucault \(1972, 1977\), we can prob-lematize this question from the outset and see any belief not as an object of good **34** For a critical reassessment of Malinowski’s theories, see MacDonald 1984–1986 and 1995.

or bad, right or wrong knowledge, but as a subject of discourse, as a way of talking about and enacting social values and ideals. As part of a wider set of discursive formations, the process of lengthening life in ancient India works to circumscribe specific forms of knowledge, ways of knowing, and ways of enacting that knowledge. The proponents of early Vedic rituals would have been successful in ensuring that their ideologies and practices were dominant and normative if they and their clients accepted fully \(that is, “believed”\) that their life was prolonged because of ritual participation. 

With this said, it is insufficient to cite belief as the definitive explanation for an individual’s or group’s values and behavior \(Ruel 2005: 261\). It is too simplistic, if not analytically untenable, to identify belief and be done with it \(as if belief is direct evidence of a person’s brain structure\). Beliefs certainly play important social, moral, and personal roles, but a statement of belief should immediately raise questions about how individuals come to hold such beliefs. This reframes the question in terms of the history of the institutionalization of specific beliefs and underlying processes and structures that make individuals fully internalize and embody them. 

Belief functions then as a performative statement about group allegiance and ideological commitment \(Lopez 1998\). We should thus identify the object of that belief, the status that object holds in society, and the ideologies and practices that lend authority and meaning to it in the first place. It is a mistake to think that belief is, in Ruel’s \(2005: 262\) words, “fundamentally an interior state, a psychological condition.” Sharf \(1998: 114\) puts it best when he states, “all attempts to signify ‘inner experience’ are destined to remain ‘well-meaning squirms that get us nowhere.’” 

In other words, the problem with the concept of belief is that it all too easily backs you into an interpretative corner where the quality of a belief can only be assessed by your own standards. When people disagree with or cannot understand a given 

belief – especially when cornered intellectually – they usually judge it as irrational, wrong, crazy, or infantile because their own beliefs are not so. Furthermore, as 

Barry Stephenson \(2015: 72\) observes, “the notion of belief is today so laden with literalism and an objectivist epistemology” that it fails to account for rites “characterized by a subjunctive mood, ludic playfulness, and imagination . . . The implied ontology \[underlying exactly what people believe\] here lacks nuance and sophistication. Moreover, many ritual traditions emphasize participation or observance 

over belief.” The point here is that a reductionist emphasis on what goes on in people’s minds – which is all too often implied with the concept of magic – distracts from the primary task of explaining the complex social realities and relationships that affect, constrain, and give meaning to the identities of individuals and the circumscribed choices they can make. It also fails to explain the complex internal logic of such practices in their own terms. As Bell \(1992: 190\) forcefully states, “Not only is ideology not a matter of belief; in actuality it rarely demands belief. Ideologies 

Believing in Magic and Other Pitfalls with Interpreting the Atharvaveda **247**

function as such by not requiring complete faith in each tenet or idea; all that is required is consent.” 

Let me defer once again to my 2011 article. In the case of lengthening life in 

ancient India, it may have been the case that a sacrificer was content with the ritual’s outcome because, like his ritually active compatriots, he too continued to grow old. However, poets are quick to point out that various gods can threaten a sacrificer’s life and throughout the R̥gveda and Atharvaveda, the warrior god Indra is instructed to kill individuals who do not perform rituals. In failing to do so, such people become legitimate targets for sustained violence. This is a powerful ethical and symbolic incentive for ritual participation. We can speculate then that when 

early Vedic Indians ritually lengthened their lives they would have “put themselves in the right” by creating an appearance of “ethical impeccability” \(Bourdieu 1977: 22\). The ritualized process of lengthening life thus constitutes a symbolically and ethically charged field of struggle. The fact that ritual participants misrecognize the arbitrary nature of these purposes \(prestige, wealth, ethical/ritual correctness\) supports and legitimizes a coherent, yet discursively self-interested worldview 

wherein life can be rhetorically and ritually lengthened.35 Since no poet openly 

questions the stated goals of the ritual, this suggests that ritual participants are motivated by, in Bourdieu’s words, a “pure, disinterested respect for the rule”; or to turn this formulation on its head, an unwavering performative commitment to 

the ritual’s figurative efficacy to lengthen life. To appropriate Stoller’s \(1998: 252\) useful concept of “embodied rationality” for the early Vedic context, it is not that ritual participants master life through ritualized practices, but rather that such practices directed towards prolonging life master ritual participants. Vedic Indians thus become the primary producers and enactors of a dominant ideology that 

reproduces their privileged identities and socioeconomic positions. 

The ritualized process of lengthening life thus reflects a complex set of recip-

rocal relationships between poet-priests, patrons, gods, and the wider community. 

In lengthening life, all parties exercise their practical sense of how to monopolize, challenge, or capitalize on ethical, socioeconomic, and political advantages. It would **35** For Bourdieu \(1977\), misrecognition refers to an everyday, taken-for-granted process wherein behaviors of social empowerment, authority, and domination are not recognized for what they are. Because of learned, almost unconscious dispositions, people struggle to identify self-interested practices that control the flow of economic and symbolic capital. In addition, individuals and groups strategically attribute such behavior to other interpretative realms, often moral, cultural, or supernatural, which are themselves difficult to question without failing to meet group expectations, values, and standards. In projecting such behavior into these realms, in preventing people from recognizing their arbitrary nature \(why such practices are deemed to have value in the first place\), self-interested motivations are concealed – misrecognized – and inequities and uneven relationships of power can be maintained.

have been ritually and politically detrimental, if not absurd to question the rhetorical goals of the ritual because one would be jeopardizing one’s access to various economic and symbolic benefits, if not undermining one’s status and membership 

in Vedic society. The use of ā́yus in the R̥gveda and Atharvaveda thus highlights a complex set of strategies at the micro-political level of early Vedic society; that is, in lived reality, in which ritual participants constantly embody, reproduce, and give value to their lives in a heavily ritualized way. Conversely, this discourse can be understood as deeply rational – as a form of practical logic – full of common-sense, and obvious to the point of being taken for granted, which is a conclusion about the mindset of ancient Indians that is well beyond what any theory of magic can tell us about their cognitive capacities, hopes, and lives.36

**4  Conclusion**

If we are to engage in judicious and theoretically informed analysis of the complex ideals, values, and practices that make early Vedic rituals coherent, compelling, and the right thing to do, we need to examine systematically the epistemological 

and metaphysical assumptions, the complex discursive formations and practices, 

and embodied forms of knowledge that the texts reveal. One way to do this is to 

abandon the concept of magic, which, to paraphrase Edmund Leach, says abso-

lutely nothing meaningful at all. To extend J. Z. Smith’s assessment of the concept of religion \(1988\), magic is not only the Frankenstein-like creation of scholars; it is a monster in need of grave exorcising. It is the ultimate weasel word. Consequently, I challenge Vedic scholars to update their theoretical horizons with contemporary theories for understanding human behavior that shun any notion of a discrete, 

deficient, or unevolved mindset. In contrast, such theories should interpret ritual practices and their non-empirical claims in terms of agency, performance, the body, and institutionalized forms of normative discourse, practice, and representation. 

In particular, the fields of cultural history, discourse analysis, gender studies, ritual studies, microsociology, and actor-network theory, to name but a few approaches, 

provide significant ways to understand the complex and coherent lived worlds 

**36** For the notion of practical logic, see Bourdieu 1977: 96–158, especially the quote from page 115, cited above. Practical logic is a kind of common-sense rationality. It refers to pre-determined and learned dispositions, values, and ideals \(Bourdieu’s habitus\) that provide people with dominant and practical ways to understand and negotiate a nebulous social world based on everyday necessity. In this sense, practical rationality more closely approximates the various ways in which people rationalize their decisions based on shared values and truths, and thereby exercise a normative rationale for doing what they do.

in which all human beings inhabit. The field of cognitive linguistics also offers a fruitful way to map conceptual landscapes, particularly in terms of metaphor and 

metonymy, rather than in terms of the reductive category of false belief, cathartic wish-fulfilment, or Frazerian notions of similarity and contagion. Such an intellectual move would be truly magical for the field of Vedic studies.
