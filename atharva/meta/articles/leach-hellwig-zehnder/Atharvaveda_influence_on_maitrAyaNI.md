**Influence of the Atharvaveda on Rituals **

**in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā**

**Abstract:** The paper examines the influence of the Atharvaveda \(AV\) on the 

Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā \(MS\), an early Yajurvedic text. The culture and rituals of the people who developed the AV are believed to have significantly influenced śrauta 

rituals, which initially involved offerings to gods in the sacred fire with verses mainly from the R̥gveda \(RV\). Over time, Yajurvedic priests expanded these rituals, incorporating various rites and beliefs from a diverse society of disunited tribes and villages. The AV had a major influence on Yajurvedic rituals, with its impact on the MS varying across different chapters due to their being composed in different periods by different authors. 

In the mantra chapters of the MS \(excluding IV 10–14\), there are 1,173 verse 

and verse-like mantras. Among them 92 citations from the AV Śaunaka recension 

\(AVŚ\) and 169 from the AV Paippalāda recension \(AVP\) are confirmed, along with 

349 citations from the RV. These verses are often quoted with some variations in 

words, grammatical forms, and word order, indicating a waning dependence on 

the RV and AV. 

The AV was initially less known to the Maitrāyaṇī priests compared to the RV. 

The AVŚ was associated with the soma ritual and the expiatory rites in the MS in an earlier period, while the AVP became more influential later. After the introduction of the agniciti ritual, all three texts \(RV/AVŚ/AVP\) were better known to the Yajurvedins than before, which can be seen from the significant increase in the number of citations, especially from the increase of citations in the form of sūkta. The more accurate citations of the RV compared to the AVŚ suggest that the RV had a more 

developed learning system, whereas the AVŚ was not fully canonized and was less 

widespread. 

**Note:** I would like to express my sincere thanks to Robert Leach, Thomas Zehnder, Oliver Hellwig and Prof. Angelika Malinar \(University of Zurich\) for their very careful review and useful suggestions.

**1  Introduction**

The culture and rituals of the people who developed the Atharvaveda \(AV\) are 

generally believed to have extensively influenced śrauta rituals.1 Initially, śrauta rituals included, as their main action, offerings to the gods in the sacred fire during the recitation of laudatory verses, which are mainly taken from the R̥gveda \(RV\), to invoke and praise these gods. Based on this simple ritual, Yajurvedic priests 

developed a series of rituals comprising many ritual actions conducted by numer-

ous priests playing a variety of roles, influenced by various rites and by beliefs held by the diverse society of that time, consisting of disunited tribes and villages.2 

Those who composed and transmitted the Atharvaveda had a major influence on 

the Yajurvedic people. An examination of the influence of the Atharvaveda on the 

Yajurveda, especially on the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā \(MS\), one of the oldest Yajurvedic texts, will contribute significantly to understanding the actions of Atharvavedic priests in this period. 

The effects of the AV on the MS are not uniform. This is because each chapter 

of the MS was composed in a different period and by different authors.3 Differ-

ences between the chapters of the MS reflect the diversity of the rituals and the societal contexts in which they were composed. Examining the influences of the 

AV on the MS reveals some phases of changes in the status of the AV in Vedic 

society. Interestingly, it also shows changes in the status of the two branches of the AV, namely, Atharvaveda Śaunaka \(AVŚ\) and Atharvaveda Paippalāda \(AVP\). 

The early chapters of the MS include fewer citations from the AVP than from the 

AVŚ, but the later chapters of the MS show a stronger influence from the AVP 

than from the AVŚ, which may indicate that the Yajurvedic priests had closer 

contacts with Śaunaka priests in the earlier period, and with Paippalāda priests 

in the later period. In this paper, I will examine the mantras in the MS, specifi-1 Heesterman \(1993\) and Parpola \(2015\) depict this influence elaborately, especially in connection with Vrātya culture.

Influence of the Atharvaveda on Rituals in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā

cally verse and verse-like4 mantras that include citations from the R̥gveda and 

the Atharvaveda. 

**2  Construction of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā**

The MS spans 54 chapters, which are divided into 25 parts according to ritual 

content \(see the list below\). These 25 parts consist of nine mantra sections, six brāhmaṇa \(ritual explanation\) sections, and ten sections with a combination of 

both. These chapters are not arranged in chronological order, and many additional passages \(these could be a whole chapter or merely some sentences or mantras in 

a chapter\) are inserted. The old chapters probably belong to the same period as the latest portions of the Atharvaveda. However, the newest chapters are comparable 

to āraṇyaka texts. Thus, I assume that a period of 200 years or more, hypotheti-

cally 900–700 BCE,5 can be accounted for in the compilation of the MS, with parts that were added at a later stage. Each chapter is different, reflecting diachronic changes as well as diversity in terms of language and description of rituals and 

beliefs. 

In the table below, all chapters of the MS are listed with the mantras and brāh-

maṇa parts distinguished. 

Mantra and brāhmaṇa parts of the MS:

**4** There are Yajurvedic mantras that do not have correct meter but are constructed like a verse, contrary to short mantras \(yajus\), for example jyótir asi ‘You are the shining’. It is difficult to determine whether such a mantra is a verse. I count such mantras as “verse-like” mantras. 

**5** Witzel \(1989: 124\) and \(1997: 266ff.\) dates the mantra chapters of Yajurveda-Saṁhitās as before 900 BCE and the brāhmaṇa chapters as after 900 BCE. But Amano \(2014–2015\) and \(2020\) argues that both the mantra and the brāhmaṇa chapters were composed over a long period of time, and that they were added gradually to the main body of the text.

Influence of the Atharvaveda on Rituals in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 

[[311]]

**3  Verse and Verse-Like Mantras **

**in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā**

The saṁhitā texts of the Yajurveda are generally understood to contain collections of yajus, mantras belonging to the Adhvaryu priest. However, this description of the Yajurveda-Saṁhitās is incorrect, as many of the mantras collected in them belong 

to the RV and the AV. Statistical data based on Bloomfield’s Vedic Concordance 

\(Bloomfield 1906; Franceschini 2007\) show that almost 15 % of the mantras of the 

MS are taken from the RV, with a lower figure from the AVŚ and AVP. 

Except the chapter of yājyānuvākyās \(IV 10–14\) containing the anuvākyās 

\(inviting verses\) and yājyās \(praising verses\), typically recited by the Hotr̥ priest, the RV and AV verses collected in the mantra sections of the MS were probably 

reserved for the Adhvaryu priest and the sacrificer. These RV and AV verses may 

have been employed in the Yajurveda-Saṁhitās by the Adhvaryu priests to increase 

the esteem of their rituals.6

**4  Atharvaveda Verses in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā**

In the ritual mantras of the MS,7 92 citations from the AVŚ and 169 from the AVP 

can be confirmed among 1,173 verse and verse-like mantras \(with 349 citations 

from the RV\).8 These AV and RV verses are quoted in their entirety when they first appear in the MS. However, from the second citation, they are quoted as pratīka 

\(i. e. only the opening words of the verse are given\), although there are also cases of entirely repeated citations. This practice had been established during transmission and does not reflect the shape of the text in the period of its composition. The quoted verses are not always identical to their source, but exhibit different degrees of variations. There are differences in the choice of words, in grammatical forms, and in word order. In some cases, one or more pādas also lack correspondences 

to the RV and AV. The differences mostly do not seem to be motivated by specific 

**6** This is probably because said priests and sacrificers thought that the RV and AV words could reach the gods, in contrast with their yajus spoken to the tools and materials in the ritual. 

**7** This is excepting the chapter of the yājyānuvākyās, because this chapter is not connected to a certain ritual, and it could have been additionally composed of verses mainly used as anuvākyās and yājyās for various rituals in a later period. 

**8** With possible cases, a further 100 citations from the RV can be counted, 133 from the AVŚ and 116 

from the AVP; see section 5, Table 1 below. 

**312** 

Kyoko Amano

circumstances, but are rather arbitrary. These differences may indicate a situation where dependence on the RV and AV was waning. 

Notably, there is no special term to indicate an AV verse in the MS. Rather, AV 

verses are referred to by feminine adjectives that imply ellipsis of the word  ŕ̥c – 

‘sacred verse’, in the same way as RV verses are quoted. 

**4.1  Differences in Various Points and Various Grades **

In the following examples, we see lexical changes \( \), variations of grammatical forms \( \), and changes of word order \( \):



MS II 9,2:122,7f.

yásya 

kr̥ṇmó havír gr̥hé \_ tám tvám  ǀ

tásmai 

sómo ádhi bravad ayáṃ ca bráhmaṇas pátiḥ  ǁ

In some cases there are a large number of differences:



MS II 5,10:61,12f. 

devā́nām eṣá upanāhá āsīd apā́ṃ pátir vr̥ṣabhá óṣadhīnām ǀ

In the following example, only pāda a corresponds to AVŚ and AVP \( \):

**4.2  Correspondence among RV/AVŚ/AVP and Choice of MS**

Many of the cited verses are from a single source \(i. e. RV, AVŚ or AVP\). In some cases, however, the verse is attested in two \(RV and AVŚ, RV and AVP, AVŚ and AVP\) or in all three sources; each of these combinations occurs. The verses common to 

MS and RV/AVŚ/AVP are identical in some cases \(RV = AVŚ = AVP\). However, they 

also vary in many instances, and again each combination occurs. Thus, if expressed in mathematical notation, RV = AVŚ \(≠ AVP\), RV = AVP \(≠ AVŚ\), AVŚ = AVP \(≠ RV\), 

and RV ≠ AVŚ ≠ AVP. The MS may draw from all three sources, without showing 

a clear bias toward any one of them, even though it seems that its authors were 

more aware of the RV than of the AVŚ and AVP. In many cases, multiple influences 

from two or more of RV/AVŚ/AVP can be seen in a verse or a sūkta. The MS seems to have intentionally employed words and forms from different texts, at least in some cases, perhaps because the Maitrāyaṇīyas wanted to display their familiarity with all the saṁhitās in question. 

In the following example, the MS version is different from AVŚ and AVP 

at badhyámānās, identical with AVP at  prajā́patiḥ, and identical with AVŚ at  

saṃrarāṇáḥ:



MS I 2,15:25,5f. 



yé badhyámānam ánu badhyámānā anváikṣanta mánasā cákṣuṣā ca ǀ



agníṣ ṭáṃ ágre prámumoktu deváḥ prajā́patiḥ prajáyā saṁrarāṇáḥ ǁ



~ AVŚ 2,34,3

~ AVP 3,32,4



ye badhyamānam anu dīdhyānā anvaikṣanta manasā cakṣuṣā ca  ǀ



agniṣ ṭān agre pra mumoktu devaḥ prajāpatiḥ prajayā 9  saṃvidānaḥ ǁ

**9** The Kahimirian manuscript has prajābhis, which the Kauśika-Sūtra and Vaitāna-Sūtra follow.

In the following example, the MS has a connection with all of the sources \(RV/AVŚ/

AVP\). It has suphā́lās, vítudantu, tóṣamānā supippalā́s, and óṣadhīḥ in common with the AVŚ, abhy and vāháiḥ with the RV, and etu and supippalā́s  with the AVP. 

The intention of MS is perhaps to show familiarity with all three saṁhitās: 



MS II 7,12:92,1f.10

śunáṃ 

suphā́lā vítudantu bhū́miṃ śunáṃ kīnā́śo abhyètu vāháiḥ ǀ

śunāsīrā haviṣā yo \+yajātai supippalā oṣadhayas santu tasmai  ǁ

There are many cases where one or two of RV/AVŚ/AVP can be recognized as the 

source of citation in the MS. The following example is AVP 9,1,8 or AVŚ 5,27,9 as the source of MS II 12,6, where there is the slightest difference between MS and AVP/

AVŚ in comparison to RV:



MS II 12,6:150,14f.

**10** This so-called kr̥ṣi-sūkta is examined in detail in Jones \(2017: 24–84\).

**4.3  Citation of a Single Verse and a Series of Verses**

In some cases, a series of mantras in the MS consists of verses quoted from different places in the RV and AV. For example, a series of mantras in MS I 10,3, which are used for the ancester rite, is quoted from different places in the RV and AV as follows: **verses in MS**

**source/parallel in RV/AV**

**MS I 10,3: 142,11–13**

~ RV 1,82,3

**MS I 10,3: 143,1f. **

~ AVŚ 6,120,1, AVP 16,50,9

**MS I 10,3: 143,10f. **

~ AVŚ 7,3,1, AVP 20,2,1

**MS I 10,3: 143,12–14**

~ RV 1,82,2, AVŚ 18,4,61, AVP 18,81,19

**MS I 10,3: 143,15f. **

~ RV 10,57,3, AVP 19,24,10

**MS I 10,3: 143,17f. **

~ RV 10,57,4, AVŚ 1,6,3, AVP 19,24,11

**MS I 10,3: 143,19f. **

~ RV 10,57,5, AVP 19,24,12

**MS I 10,3: 144,2f. **

~ RV 4,10,1

In contrast to quotations from different places in the source texts, the following instances indicate a link between a series of mantras in the MS and an entire sūkta of the RV/AV. For example, in MS I 2,9 and I 2,13–14, there are six verses from AVŚ 

7,26. They are not quoted en bloc but are scattered. Neverthless, we can recognize the sūkta of AVŚ 7,26 related to MS I 2. 

The passages in the MS given below show such a loose relation between a series 

of mantras in the MS and a sūkta of the RV/AV.

These examples, which show only a loose connection between the MS and an RV/

AV sūkta, are also characterized by a “loose citation,” that is, the text of the two versions differs considerably. 

In the following instances, the MS cites two or three connected verses, so-called dvr̥cas and tr̥cas:

Apparently, such dvr̥cas and tr̥cas were popular for assembling the MS mantras. In their case, the text is largely faithful to the source, which is probably because the

[[317]]

memorisation of dvr̥cas and tr̥cas was the method by which the Yajurvedic priests learnt and quoted the RV and AV. 

If more than two or three connected RV and AV verses are cited, in some cases 

this becomes a citation of an entire sūkta. The following cases can be considered as marking the beginning of “sūkta citation” that gained popularity in the later period:

As can be seen in the table above, citations of an entire sūkta are clustered in the agniciti mantra chapter \(MS II 7–13\). The sūkta citations are mostly taken from 

the RV, but can also be from both the RV and the AV, or only from the AV. However, in such a sūkta citation, it is often difficult to determine a single source of the citation, as we may find multiple influences from all three saṁhitās \(RV/AVŚ/AVP\) in the MS. 

The following example show the case where a verse that is close to the AVP \(MS 

II 10,4:135,13f.\) and another that is close to the RV and the AVŚ \(MS II 10,4:136,2f.\) are juxaposed in the same sūkta citation:

MS II 13,6–9 \(II 13 is the last of the agniciti mantras, probably a later addition\) contains many dvr̥cas and tr̥cas from the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th maṇḍalas of the RV 

and their parallels in the AVŚ, which are all found in the 20th kāṇḍa. Prabably, both the MS and the AVŚ borrowed these dvr̥cas and tr̥cas from different maṇḍalas of 

the RV for ritual use. All these dvr̥cas and tr̥cas show little difference between the texts. This chapter of the MS cites some sūktas from the AVŚ and the AVP with the parallels from the 10th maṇḍala of the RV, and these sūktas show many differences between the MS and the RV/AV parallels. 

MS III 16 \(the last of the aśvamedha mantras, probably a later addition\) 

shows another phenomenon. This chapter contains some very large and accu-

rate sūkta citations from the RV. It also cites sūktas from the AVP, but not as accurately as those from the RV. In the period MS III 16 was composed, the learning 

of sūktas of the RV was probably well developed, while the AVP was less well 

known. 

MS III 16,5 contains a sūkta-like collection which has a parallel in both the AVŚ 

and the AVP \(with considerable differences\), though only the first and last of the seven verses of the AV versions are present:

Regarding these AV verses, the so-called mr̥gāra-sūktāni, Bloomfield \(1899: 

52\) argued that it is “possible to imagine that the Yajus-stanzas were picked out of longer hymns, though there is no special reason for such a supposition. That 

they were not gathered from the Atharvan hymns in question may be regarded 

as certain.” This refers to the crucial question about the date of the composition of the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda mantras, with respect to which Bloomfield 

states that “the redaction of the AV. holds much the same place compared with the redactions of the YV.” However, the final redaction of this sūkta in the MS could not have taken place in an ancient period because the mantra part and the list of sacrificial animals of the aśvamedha are chronologically comparable with the latest 

chapter of the Taittirīya-Saṁhitā and the additional book on the aśvamedha of the Kāṭhaka-Saṁhitā. The conformity between the AVŚ and the AVP in these verses may 

indicate a younger period or a more developed stage of canonization. 

**5  Statistical Account of R̥gveda and Atharvaveda **

**Citations in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā**

In this section, I present statistical data of all RV/AV verses cited in each chapter of the MS. **The first table** lists the number of cited verses and their appearance rates in all verse and verse-like mantras. For example, MS I 2 \(mantras for the preparation of the soma ritual\) contains 65 verse\(-like\) mantras, including 20 from the RV, 11 from the AVŚ, and 8 from the AVP. Therefore, of all the verse\(-like\) mantras, 31 % 

are from the RV, while 17 % are from the AVŚ and 12 % are from the AVP. 

In some cases, it is difficult to determine the source \(RV/AVŚ/AVP\) that the MS 

cites, for example when the citations show no variations or are different from each other and from the MS to an almost equal extent. The number of such unclear cases is given in the table in brackets: \(\+\). MS I 2 includes 5 such unclear cases of citation from the RV \(noted as 20 \(\+5\)\), 7 cases of citation from the AVŚ \(noted as 11 \(\+7\)\), 

Influence of the Atharvaveda on Rituals in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 

[[321]]

and 6 cases of citation from the AVP \(noted as 8 \(\+6\)\). The sum of these represents the maximum possible number \(RV 25, AVŚ 18, AVP 14\), based on which the per-centages are calculated using minimum and maximum values \(RV 31~38 %, AVŚ 

17~28 %, AVP 12~22 % for MS I 2\). 

There are also cases where influences from two or three sources can be detected 

\(for example MS II 7,12:92,1f., RV 4,57,8, AVŚ 3,17,5, AVP 2,22,3 in section 4.2 above\). 

I counted both or all three. Cases of citations with pratīka are also accounted for in these data. 

**The second table** shows the level of conformity with the RV and AVŚ for each chapter of the MS. The AVP is excluded from consideration because there are many 

cases in its transmission where there are variant readings that need to be exam-

ined. It clarifies how familiar each chapter of the MS was with these saṁhitās, 

and also the extent to which the RV and AVŚ were canonized and widely transmit-

ted. The citations with pratīka and the unclear cases of the citations \(indicated in brakets \(\+\) in the Table 1 above\) are not included here. Therefore, the numerical data in this table does not represent the overall situation, but is only effective for comparing RV and AVŚ. According to the degree of similarity of citations to the 

original saṁhitās, citations are classified into three categories: 1\) same, where the wording of the verse is identical, 2\) slightly varying, and 3\) varying. To estimate the grade of approximation, I assigned a difference of a word a value of 1 point, a difference of a grammatical form 0.5 points, and a difference of word order 0.5 points. 

Therefore, a verse measured as having a value of less than 3 points is classified as 2\) slightly varying, and that with more than 3 points is classified as 3\) varying. When one or more pādas lack a correspondence, it is classified as 3\) varying.

**6  Relationship of Rituals in the MS **

**to the RV/AVŚ/AVP**

On the basis of the examination and the statistical data presented above, I will now try to trace the evolution of contacts between the MS and the RV/AVŚ/AVP, and to 

classify the chapters of the MS into the following groups. 

Group I \(MS I 1–II 6\):

In the chapters that form the first and second books of the MS \(with the excep-

tion of those dealing with the agniciti\), the RV provides more citations than the AVŚ/

AVP with more accuracy \(of all RV citations in MS I 1–II 6 the accurate citations are 61 %, of all AVŚ citations the accurate citations are 18 %\) The AVP is slightly more frequently cited than the AVŚ \(46 \[\+32\] citations in the AVP, 41 \[\+35\] citations in the AVŚ\). According to the influence from the AVŚ/AVP, the chapters and rituals can be classified into four:

1\) Rituals that are not \(or only slightly\) related to the AV: MS I 5 agnyupasthāna, MS I 6 agnyādhāna, MS II 6 rājasūya. 

Influence of the Atharvaveda on Rituals in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 

[[325]]





The Atharvaveda hardly influenced MS I 5 and MS I 6, chapters that were 

composed in a relatively early phase of the composition of the MS.12 Chapter II 

6, dealing with the rājasūya \(royal consecration\), has no citation from the AV. 

This is notable because it is commonly understood that Brahman priests from 

Atharvavedic families had close relations with kings. In the early period of the 

śrauta ritual formation, or at least in the MS, the AV priests did not influence 

the royal consecration ritual. 





In MS I 5 and I 6, the recitation and learning of sets of two or three RV 

verses \(dvr̥cas and tr̥cas\) was practised. This method seems to have effected 

good learning because these sets of verses are cited accurately in most cases. 

2\) Rituals that are related to the AVŚ more than the AVP: MS I 2 soma adhvara 

\(preparation\), I 3 soma graha \(drawing soma\), II 1–4 kāmyā-iṣṭi





The AVŚ clearly influenced the soma ritual and the sacrifices for special 

wishes described in the MS. The AVP was less known to \(or valued by\) the 

authors who composed these mantras. 

3\) Rituals that are related to the AVP more than the AVŚ: MS I 7 punarādhāna, MS 

I 10 cāturmāsya, MS I 11 vājapeya. 





MS I 7 is one of the youngest chapters, judging from an analysis of its lin-

guistic features.13 The influence from the AVP in MS I 7 probably indicates that 

the influence of the AVP was greater in the later period. MS I 10, the chapter of the seasonal sacrifices, and MS I 11, the chapter of the vājapeya \(soma drinking 

for victory in the chariot race\), are considered to be not particularly young in 

terms of stylistic and linguistic features.14 However, the contact with the AVP 

may indicate that the composition of these chapters was in a relatively late 

period or that these rituals specifically originated from the Paippalāda tradi-

tion. MS I 1 darśapūrṇamāsa includes four citations from the AVP, which are 

more than the single citation from both the RV and the AVŚ. All four citations 

from the AVP are from its 20th book. Although the total number is small and it 

is difficult to discuss the question of influence from just a few quotations, there was possibly some relationship with the establishment of the 20th kāṇḍa of the 

AVP. Similarly, although the overall number is small, in MS I 4, the chapter of 

yajamāna, the influence of the AVP is slightly greater. MS I 4 is also presumed 

to have been composed in a later period.15

4\) Rituals that are related to the AVŚ and AVP: MS I 8,8–9 expiatory rites 

\(prāyaścitti\) of the agnihotra, MS II 5 kāmya-paśu.

These chapters include only a few verse-like mantras and it is difficult to 

discuss relations of influence, but it is notable that they cite verses from both of AVŚ and AVP to the same extent. These chapters are considered to have been 

composed in a later period.16

Group II \(MS II 7–IV\):

The introduction of the agniciti to the Yajurvedic ritual description marks 

a major turning point in Vedic ritual. The extensive number of mantras for the 

agniciti \(II 7–13\) reflects the large scale of this ritual. In addition, the brāhmaṇa part of the agniciti \(III 1–5\) contains new stylistic and linguistic features that the third and fourth books have in common.17 It can be inferred that the mantras of 

the agniciti \(MS II 7–13\), sautrāmaṇī \(MS III 11\), aśvamedha \(MS III 12–13 and 16\), and pravargya \(MS IV 9\) were composed after most chapters in Group I. According 

to the agniciti, aśvamedha and pravargya citations, the AVP was well known, and 

more influential than the AVŚ \(according to the agniciti 94 \[\+47\] citations in the AVP, 41 \[\+56\] citations in the AVŚ; according to III–IV total 29 \[\+37\] in the AVP, 10 

\[\+42\] in the AVŚ\). Given the significant increase in the number of citations, it seems that the RV, AVŚ and AVP were all better known to the authors of the chapters in 

Group II than to those in Group I. This is also evident from the fact that there are many sūkta citations in these chapters \(see 4.3 above\). However, there is no significant change \(or a slight decrease\) in the accuracy of the citations from the RV and AVŚ \(of all RV citations in MS II 7–IV 9 51 % are accurate, of all AVŚ citations 13 % 

are accurate\). 

A closer examination of the agniciti mantras \(MS II 7–13\) reveals that each 

chapter has its peculiarity. MS II 7 and II 10 contain a large number of RV cita-

tions, whereas MS II 8 and II 11 are chapters of non-verse mantras \(yajus\). MS II 9 is an additional chapter mentioning many Hindu gods’ names;18 this chapter 

contains many AVP verses. MS II 12 is also an Atharvaveda-oriented chapter, con-

taining 11 verses from the AVŚ and 18 from the AVP \(and 2 from the RV; see 

Table 1\). In all, the AVP has a closer connection with the agniciti of the MS than does the AVŚ. 

MS II 13, the last of the agniciti mantras, probably a later addition, contains 

many sets of two or three verses from different maṇḍalas of the RV and the 20th 

kāṇḍa of the AVŚ \(see 4.3\). The 20th kāṇḍa of the AVŚ probably borrowed verses 

**16** MS II 5 belongs to a younger linguistic layer; see Amano \(2016b\), 480–483 and 487. MS I 8,8–9, the expiatory rites of the agnihotra, were added to the main part of the agnihotra chpater \(I 8,1–5\) in a later period.

Influence of the Atharvaveda on Rituals in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 

[[327]]

from different maṇḍalas of the RV for use in the agniciti ritual, and this influ-

enced the composition of agniciti mantras in MS II 13. All these verses show 

remarkable conformity between RV, AVŚ, and MS versions. The method of com-

bining three verses \(tr̥cas\) for reciting and learning probably brought about such accuracy. 

Although Group II generally shows a connection with the AV, a large part of the 

sautrāmaṇī \(MS III 11\) and the aśvamedha mantras \(MS III 12–13\) were original to 

the Yajurveda. 

MS III 16, the additional part of the aśvamedha mantras, contains some very 

large and accurate sūkta citations from the RV \(see 4.3 as well as Table 1 and 2\). 

Similar to MS II 13, this chapter belongs to authors with a good knowledge of the RV. 

In MS III 16, the AVP is better known to the authors than is the AVŚ. 

**7  Conclusion: The Atharvaveda Viewed from **

**the Study of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā**

Verses of the Atharvaveda were known to the Maitrāyaṇī priests from the initial 

period when they were composing their early mantras, but much less than the RV. 

The Śaunaka Atharvaveda was related to the soma ritual and the expiatory rites 

in the MS. Except for these chapters, or after these chapters, the Paippalāda Atharvaveda seems to have come into closer contact with the Maitrāyaṇī priests than the Śaunaka. 

At the time of the introduction of the agniciti into Yajurvedic ritual, all three schools of RV/AVŚ/AVP were known to or connected with the Yajurvedins. RV/AV 

verses became better known in the form of sūkta. During the composition of the 

MS, the Maitrāyaṇīyas knew the RV more accurately than the AV. This is probably 

because a good learning system for the RV had been developed, and the AV had not 

yet been fully canonized and was less widespread.

**Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā **

**in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya**

**Abstract:** In this article, a systematic search for the Vedic quotations found in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya is conducted in the text of the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā \(PS\). 

This endeavour seemed promising as Wilhelm Rau had only a small part of the 

PS at his disposal in his classical study of this topic \(published 1985\), whereas now this text – as transmitted in Odisha – has been edited in its entirety and is available in electronic form. As a result of my analysis, the source of quite a few of the 275 

untraced Vedic quotations in the Mahābhāṣya that are listed by Rau is identified. In passing, English translations are provided for all passages discussed. 

**1 Introduction**

**1.1** My original motive for looking more closely at the Vedic quotations in the Mahābhāṣya was the hope that one or other improvement of the text of the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā \(PS\) might result from it.1 This hope was fuelled by a handful 

of well-known cases where a correction in a PS passage actually emerged from 

its being quoted in the Mahābhāṣya. One such case is PS 2.87.1a, where the 

Mahābhāṣya quotation manāyyai tantuḥ \(R491\) was crucial for the restoration of the dative ✶ manāyyai ‘for Manāyī’ from the PS readings Odisha manāyai and Kashmir manāyī \(see Rau 1985a: 162; Zehnder 1999: 189\). 

**1.2** It is to Wilhelm Rau’s great credit that the Vedic quotations in the Mahābhāṣya are readily accessible to people less familiar with this complex subject. Without his extensive collection of the relevant material \(= Rau 1985\), it would have been very difficult to conduct an investigation like the one that follows here.2 Rau also took great efforts to trace the sources of the collected quotations in the extant Vedic corpus, which was an arduous task in his time as there were hardly any relevant 

**1** The research on which this article is based was conducted within the framework of the Zurich 

Paippalāda project \(www.atharvavedapaippalada.uzh.ch\). I would like to thank my colleagues Robert Leach and Oliver Hellwig as well as the project directors Paul Widmer and Angelika Malinar for their support. 

**2** This was anticipated by Etter \(1987: 438\) in her recension of Rau \(1985\): “ein Werk, das . . . insbe-sondere auch dem Vedisten den nicht immer einfachen Umgang mit dem Mahābhāṣya erleichtert.”

texts available in electronic form. Another drawback for Vedic studies in Rau’s time was that the PS, apart from kāṇḍas 1–4, was only available in the mutilated form 

in which it survives in the Kashmirian manuscript \(K\). In the case of the Vedic quotations in the Mahābhāṣya, this is particularly grievous because there is a special connection between these two texts,3 i.e. the PS – along with the Rigveda and the Kāṭhaka-Saṁhitā – is quoted particularly often in the Mahābhāṣya. 

**1.3** In the meantime, the situation has changed substantially. Not only are the majority of Vedic texts now available in electronic form, making the tracking 

down of Vedic passages much easier and faster, but the discovery of the Odishan 

transmission has also presented us with a much more reliable and more complete 

text of the PS. Under these circumstances, it appeared promising to search again 

for the quotations not traced by Rau, not least because an – albeit provisional – 

electronic text of the PS has recently become available \(see Griffiths et al. 2020\). 

Although this e-text of the PS in its present state is far from being definitive, as for long stretches it simply reproduces what Bhattacharya \(1997–2016\) edited, and as 

it contains innumerable typos and wrong word divisions, it is an invaluable tool 

for Vedic studies. 

**2 Untraced Vedic Quotations in the Mahābhāṣya**

**2.1** Rau \(1985: 8–78\) lists a total of 763 Vedic quotations in the Mahābhāṣya. Of these, 275 are labelled with the symbol \(/\) which indicates that he considers the quotation in question to be untraceable in the surviving Vedic texts \(Rau 1985: 6, point 4c\). These 275 items are listed in the following table \(other than in this table, Rau’s consecutive numbers are prefixed by an R in this article\). Bold type indicates that the item is mentioned in the present article and that, in my opinion, it is no longer to be regarded as an untraced Vedic quotation. 

003, 008, 015, 016, **021**, 022, 027, 037, 043, 044, 046, 055, 057, 059, **061**, 062, 067, 070, 071, 072, 076, 080, 081, 082, 083, 086, 089, 090, 091, **093**, 095, **096**, 098, 099, 100, 105, 107, 109, **113**, 124, 126, **128**, 130, 132, 134, 137, 139, 145, 146, 147, **148**, 149, 150, **152**, **157**, 165, **168**, 169, 170, 173, 176, 178, 179, 188, **189**, **192**, 193, 194, 195, 196, 198, 199, 201, 203, 211, 212, 216, 218, 219, 230, 232, 233, 234, **235**, **237**, 238, 242, 247, 258, 259, 261, 263, **265**, 267, 268, 269, 270, 275, 278, 279, 281, 284, 288, 289, 290, 291, 294, 295, **296**, 297, 298, 302, 306, 307, 313, 319, 323, 324, 327, 329, 331, 340, 341, 352, 366, 367, 371, 375, 377, **387**, 388, **389**, 391, 392, 395, 399, 404, 409, 411, 422, 423, 425, **426**, 428, **431**, 436, 440, 445, 446, 449, 453, **454**, 456, 465, 467, 474, 476, 477, 478, **482**, **484**, 486, 488, 489, 490, **494**, 497, 499, 503, 504, **505**, **508**, **509**, 510, 511, 512, 515, 518, 519, 522, **3** See e.g. Rau \(1985: 103\) and Griffiths \(2009: XL\).

527, 530, 534, 535, 537, 538, 545, **546**, 551, 552, 557, **558**, 559, 568, **569**, **571**, 576, 579, 581, 582, **586**, 589, 590, 591, **595**, 597, 598, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 616, 617, **618**, 619, **624**, 628, 631, 632, **633**, 635, **637**, 644, 645, 648, 650, 652, 654, **659**, 660, 664, **667**, 669, 671, 672, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 680, 681, 682b, 685, 688, 691, 694, 697, 698, 699, 700, 705, **707**, 720, 721, 722, 725, 729, 730, 732, 733, 735, 739, **740**, 741, 743, 748, 750, **751**, 753, 754, 757, **760**, 761

This list comprises quite a few cases where Rau applies his sign \(/\) even though he knows and indicates the probable source. He follows the policy of considering the identity of the source as not certain if there is even a minimal difference between it and the quotation. With a less rigorous approach, as endorsed by authors such 

as Renou \(1953; see §4.4. below\) and Witzel \(1986\), as well as in statements by Rau himself,4 the number of untraced sources will be significantly reduced. 

**2.2** The following items \(1\) to \(14\) and \(16\) to \(17\) are instances of such an approximate but hardly doubtful equation that involve the PS. Interspersed in this material is item \(15\) R637 concerning the Yajurveda, that I came across in passing. 

\(1\) R061 apsucaro gahvareṣṭhāḥ vs. PS 16.73.1c apsucarā gahvareṣṭhā mahitvā 

‘\[the body \( tanūḥ\) . . .\] that moves among the waters, that rests in the deepest abyss, by its greatness’. 

Rau \(1985: 13\) states: “M\[ahā\]bh\[āṣya\] wohl hiernach zu berichtigen.” On page 100 

he adds a reference to Limaye \(1974: 544; “So schon Limaye, stillschweigend”\). 

\(2\) R113 ātmana eva nirmimīṣva iti vs. PS 5.11.8 ātmana enaṁ nir ✶ mimīṣva ‘create him \(your future son\) from yourself’. 

As noted by Lubotsky \(2002: 66\), the Mahābhāṣya confirms the emendation 

✶ mimīṣva proposed by Barret \(1917: 272\) for K mamīṣva, which is also the reading of the Odishan manuscripts. Barret does not seem to have known the Mahābhāṣya 

quotation. 

\(3\) R152 imāny arvaṇaḥ padāni vs. PS 16.15.7c \(∼ ŚS 10.4.7c\) imāny arvataḥ padā 

‘these are the footprints of the . . . horse’. 

In light of the relevant passage of the Aṣṭādhyāyī \(6.4.127–128\), which deals with the distribution of the stems arvan- and arvant-, the Mahābhāṣya reading arvaṇaḥ 

**4** See e.g. Rau \(1985: 101\): “Dieser Befund erweist die Überlieferung des Mahābhāṣya als keineswegs tadellos.” 

**334** 

Thomas Zehnder

seems out of place. Moreover, as Wackernagel \(1942: 180–181\) notes, an n- stem genitive arvaṇaḥ would contradict the evidence of the attested texts. 

\(4\) R157 ihaiva bhava mā sma gāḥ vs. PS 9.13.1c \(∼ ŚS 5.30.1c\) \+ ihaiva bhava mā nu gāḥ ‘Remain right here, do not leave\!’

In the Candravr̥tti we find the Vedic quotation ihaiva tiṣṭha mā gāḥ, which probably also echoes the PS passage \(differently Rau 1996: 329: “nur ähnlich”\). 

\(5\) R199 karmaṣaṁ kalmaṣaṁ E – kalmaṣaṁ karmaṣaṁ B vs. PS 19.26.14c anuṣyandasya kalmaṣam ‘a stain of the hind wheel?’ and KSp 19.1:1.10: tat kalmaṣam abhavat ‘that became a stain’. 

The sources of one-word quotations are, by their very nature, not readily identifiable. The r-variant karmaṣa- remains untraced. 

\(6\) R296 tena mā bhāginaṁ kr̥ṇuhi vs. ŚS 6.129.2c \( yéna . . . \) téna mā bhagínaṁ kr̥ṇu 

‘with that make me fortunate’. 

In this case, the source can be identified with good probability as the quoted 

Śaunaka pāda, since the Paippalāda parallel deviates: PS 19.32.3c \( yathā . . . \)  evā mā 

bhaginaṁ kr̥ṇu ‘so make me fortunate’. 

\(7\) R431 peciran vs. PS 9.18.6d \(∼ ŚS 5.18.11\) \( ye . . . \) apeciran ‘\[who\] had cooked’. 

The preterite of the perfect found in the Atharvaveda is certainly correct, as is also evident from the metre. 

\(8\) R494 marud asya grabhītā vs. PS 1.17.2b parur asya grabhītā ‘\[who has seized\] 

the joint of this one here as a seizer’ \(∼ ŚS 1.12.2d párvāsyā grábhītā\). 

Wackernagel \(1942: 181–182\), who knows only the ŚS and not the PS version, 

doubts that there is a relationship between the Atharvaveda and the Mahābhāṣya 

at this passage. However, a replacement of parur by marud lies within the range of what we might expect for the transmission of the latter text \(thus also Rau 

1985: 101\). 

\(9\) R505 mātaraṁ pramiṇīmi janitrīm  vs. ŚS 6.110.3d mā́ mātáraṁ prá minīj jánitrīm 

‘do not let him ruin his mother who has given birth to him’ ∼ PS 19.21.13d 

mā mātaraṁ pra ✶ minīd yā janitrī \(✶ minīd emendation by Bhattacharya 2016: 

Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya **335**

1474; the Odishan manuscripts have the second person minīr, while the pāda is lost in K\). 

In this case, the Mahābhāṣya apparently quotes the Śaunaka version. The possi-

bility that the relative clause PS yā janitrī is a secondary replacement for the accusative jánitrīm found in the ŚS and the Mahābhāṣya is less obvious because the PS 

version is metrically preferable. 

\(10\) R508 mādbhir iṣṭvā indro vr̥trahā vs. PS 10.7.2c mādbhiṣ ṭvā candro vr̥trahā 

‘Let the moon, the slayer of Vr̥tra, \[protect you\] with the months’ \(∼ ŚS 19.27.2c mādbhyás tvā candró vr̥trahā́\). 

Here, Rau himself \(1985: 54 and 101\) recommends correcting the Mahābhāṣya \(and 

the ŚS\) text in accordance with the PS version. 

\(11\) R571 yo mātr̥hā pitr̥hā bhrātr̥hā vs. PS 19.46.14ab yo mātr̥hā pitr̥hā svasr̥hā ye ca duṣkr̥taḥ ‘he who is the murderer of his mother, the murderer of his father, the murderer of his sister, and \[others\] who are wrongdoers’. 

It is highly probable that the Mahābhāṣya quotes the PS passage here. A substi-

tution of ‘sister’ by ‘brother’ – or perhaps vice versa, if this happened during the transmission of the PS – is hardly surprising, especially since the family appears to be incomplete in both versions. 

\(12\) R586 varuṇasya raghusyadaḥ vs. PS 3.2.1a \(∼ ŚS 3.7.1a\) hariṇasya raghuṣyadaḥ 

‘of the swift-running antelope’. 

Rau \(1985: 62\): “M\[ahā\]bh\[āṣya\] hiernach herzustellen.” Varuṇasya  is an obvious lectio facilior that makes no sense in the context \(see Wackernagel 1942: 181\). 

\(13\) R595 vātā vāntu diśo daśa vs. PS 5.7.9b \(∼ ŚS 4.15.8b\) vātā vāntu diśodiśaḥ ‘let the winds blow from every region’. 

\(14\) R624 śātadhāro ayaṁ maṇiḥ vs. PS 2.27.5b \(∼ ŚS 19.36.5b\) śātavāro ayaṁ 

maṇiḥ ‘this Śatavāra amulet here’. 

Rau \(1985: 65\): “M\[ahā\]bh\[āṣya\] hiernach herzustellen.” In this case, the PS parallel could not be traced by Rau, since the relevant hemistich is lost in the Kashmirian manuscript and is therefore not included in the Vedic Word-Concordance \(= Vishva 

Bandhu 1941–1963\).

\(15\) R637 śivā udrasya bheṣajī vs. VSM 16.49 \( yā́ te rudra śivā́ tanū́ḥ . . . \) śivā́ 

rutásya bheṣajī́ ‘\[Your body, O Rudra, which is auspicious, . . .\], auspicious and healing a crippled one’. 

Rau \(1985: 66\) is content to quote merely the TS version of this widespread Yajurvedic Anuṣṭubh pāda \(TS 4.5.10.1 śivā́ rudrásya bheṣajī́\). For details see Bloomfield and Edgerton \(1932: 313, §684\), who evaluate the variant readings of the second word 

as follows: “Original is certainly rutasya . . . Rudrasya . . . is an obvious lect\[io\] fac\[ilior\], and r̥tasya . . . is clearly a stupid change conditioned by the phonetic relations between r̥ and ru.” Rutásya is confirmed by RV 10.39.3d: yuvā́m íd āhur bhiṣájā 

rutásya cit ‘they say you \(the Nāsatyas\) are even healers of a crippled one’. And to rudrasya one might add that it is also a perseveration from pāda a \( yā́ te rudra śivā́ 

tanū́ḥ\). Since udrasya ‘of the otter’ is certainly out of the question, the Mahābhāṣya version can hardly be anything other than a corruption of rudrasya as found in the TS 

and as a variant reading for MS 2.9.9:127:11 rutásya. The absence of sandhi between śivā  and udrasya is reminiscent of ca udvatī instead of ca dudvatī in \(24\) R168 below. 

\(16\) R667 sanīsrasaḥ  vs. PS 6.11.5d \(∼ ŚS 5.6.4d\) sanisraso nāmāsi “you are called the slipping one” \(translation by Griffiths 2009, 141\). 

\(17\) R751 hiraṇyayī no nayatu – lies mit E B hiº naur abhavat vs. PS 7.10.7a \(∼ ŚS 

19.39.7a\) hiraṇyayī naur acarat ‘a golden boat \(i.e. the sun\) moved \[in the sky\]’. 

Given the variant reading naur abhavat, the identification of the PS pāda as the source of this quotation can hardly be doubted. See also Griffiths \(2009: 358\). 

**3 Newly Discovered Sources of Vedic Quotations **

**in the Mahābhāṣya**

In the course of my investigation, the Vedic source for the following among the 

275 quotations mentioned in §2.1. above have come to light. This collection also 

features Vedic sources other than the PS. 

\(18\) R021 aghnye dūram ut kanda vs. PS 20.40.6a aghnye dūram ✶ ut kanda ‘O cow, jump up into the distance\!’

The reference to the Mahābhāṣya is already given by Bhattacharya \(2016: 1722\) 

in his apparatus. Unlike me, he does not consider correcting the reading dūramūt, 

Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya **337**

duramūt of the Odishan manuscripts to dūram ✶ ut following Patañjali. Note that the whole sūkta PS 20.40 is not found in the Kashmirian manuscript. The immediately 

following pāda, PS 20.40.6b ni padaś caturo jahi ‘Put your four legs \[firmly\] on the ground\!’, is quoted in the Kāśikāvr̥tti \(see Rau 1993: 57, R0615\). 

\(19\) R093 aháṁ dyā́vāpr̥thivī́ ā́ tatāna vs. PS 18.59.7d prati dyāvāpr̥thivī ā tatāna  and PS 18.59.8d anu dyāvāpr̥thivī ā tatāna ‘he \(Agni\) has stretched sky and earth’. 

Here the two PS pādas cannot be regarded as the direct source of the Mahābhāṣya 

quotation, which looks rather like a blend of the PS passage and of RV 10.125.6d 

\( aháṁ rudrā́ya dhánur ā́ tanomi . . . | . . .\) aháṁ dyā́vāpr̥thivī́ ā́ viveśa quoted by Rau \(1985: 16\). 

\(20\) R096 aharahar nayamāno gām aśvaṁ puruṣaṁ paśum | vaivasvato na tr̥pyati surāyā iva durmadī ‖ vs. Mānava-Śrautasūtra 6.1.2.26 \(text after van Gelder 1961: 144, line 15–16\): aharahar nayamāno gā aśvān puruṣān paśūn | 

vaivasvato na tr̥pyati surayā iva durmadaḥ ‖ ‘Although he carries away cows, horses, people and cattle day after day, \[Yama\] Vaivasvata is not satisfied, just as one drunk on surā \(a strong drink\).’

When comparing the two versions, we note that the genitive/ablative surāyāḥ of the Mahābhāṣya is preferable to the instrumental surayā found in the MānŚS, not least because no sandhi is applied between surayā and iva in the latter case. The word durmadin- that the Mahābhāṣya shows in place of MānŚS durmada- ‘intoxicated, drunk’ seems to be a hapax legomenon. It is uncertain whether we would be 

justified in attributing it to the Vedic language. 

\(21\) R128 ā revān etu no viśaḥ  vs. PS 1.71.3b ā \+ revām̐ etu no \+ viśam ‘let the splendid one come to our clan’. The Kāśikāvr̥tti also quotes this pāda twice, once as ā 

revān etu no viśaḥ and once as ā revān etu mā viśat \(see Rau 1993: 25, R0215 

and R0216\). 

Here the Mahābhāṣya confirms the emendation \+ revām̐ \[\+ revān\] that we \(see Zehnder, Hellwig and Leach, ‘Paippalāda-Saṁhitā, Online Edition’ at PS 1.71.3\) had already established for the readings Odisha revāny and Kashmir revāṅg, before we came across this quotation. The Mahābhāṣya has the plural viśaḥ ‘to \[our\] clans’ 

instead of the singular PS \+ viśam. 

\(22\) R148 indro nas tena neṣatu  vs. PS 19.34.15ab indro mā tena nayatu panthā yo abhayaḥ sugaḥ ‘Let Indra lead me along that path that is safe and easy.’

**338** 

Thomas Zehnder

The imperative form neṣatu  found in the Mahābhāṣya could be paradigmatically associated with neṣa, a second person singular imperative that is attested here and there in the Atharvaveda \(see Narten 1964: 163, “thematische Umbiegung” of neṣi; Spiers 2020: 416\). Is PS nayatu perhaps a secondary lectio facilior for neṣatu? At PS 

1.50.2 the subjunctive present nayāt and the subjunctive aorist neṣan are found in parallel position next to each other without an obvious semantic difference. 

\(23\) R150 indro mā vakṣat  vs. PS 19.34.14a indro mā vakṣad akṣatam ‘Indra will convey me uninjured.’

\(24\) R168 udvā ca udvatī ca  vs. PS 1.86.5a dudvā ca dudvatī ca sthaḥ ‘You are Dudvā 

and Dudvatī.’

There is little doubt that this Mahābhāṣya quotation reflects the PS pāda, which 

mentions the names of two individual Kaṇvās \(certain female demons\). Note the 

absence of sandhi in ca udvatī, apparently due to the fact that the name was once dudvatī. 

\(25\) R192

o ṣu yātaṁ br̥hatī śakvarī ca 



PS 15.1.9c

oṣajātāṁ br̥hatī ca śakvarī 

‘the . . . \( oṣajātāṁ\) and great Śakvarī metre’



MS 3.16.4:189.1

avasyúvātā br̥hatī́ ná śákvarī



KS 22.14:70.12

avasyuvātā br̥hatī na śakvarī



TS 4.4.12.3–4

avasyúvātāḥ // br̥hatī́r nú śakvarīḥ



ĀśvŚS 4.12.2:332.10

avasyuvātā br̥hatī tu śakvarī

This is a tricky case, at least if our assumption is correct that the quotation indeed refers to the sources listed, and here in particular to the PS. This is the premise for the following, somewhat speculative considerations. The unanimous reading 

oṣajātāṁ of the PS manuscripts \(including K\) is difficult to make sense of and must be considered a corruption. Lelli \(2020: 48–49\) proposes the tentative emendation ✶ oṣavātā “having quick wind”. The Mahābhāṣya quotation does not solve this text-critical problem right away. Nevertheless, the vowel u that it displays in oṣuyātaṁ favours the restoration ✶ avasyuvātā ‘with supportive winds’ \(nominative singular feminine\) for the PS – following the other parallel texts – over Lelli’s proposal. This would imply that the PS text had already suffered a considerable 

disfigurement of the original text \(✶ avasyuvātā > ✶ oṣuyātāṁ?\) by Patañjali’s time.5 

**5** That is, probably in the middle of the second century BCE \(see Cardona 1976: 263–266\). 

Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya **339**

However, it is now the case that in the text of the Mahābhāṣya quotation R192 

immediately follows R193 o ṣu yātaṁ marutaḥ, so that it must be evaluated together with this untraced passage. Since the pertinent sūtra of the Aṣṭādhyāyī \(1.1.15\) deals with particles ending in -o and given the fact that R193 resembles RV 1.165.14c ó ṣú vartta marutaḥ \(see Renou 1953: 453; Rau 1985: 26\), it would seem that R192 is also considered by the Mahābhāṣya to contain the particle chain ó ṣú \[ ā́ u sú\]. The matter is complicated by the fact that the imperative dual ā . . . yātam ‘come here\!’ 

does not fit the context in either R192 or R193. As Rau \(1985: 101, fn. 1\) notes, Patañjali very rarely errs in his interpretation of Vedic words. Can we think him capable of having reinterpreted a vox nihili like PS ✶ oṣuyātāṁ into o ṣu yātaṁ? And would he have inverted the word order from br̥hatī ca śakvarī to br̥hatī śakvarī ca in order to make the two nouns \(nomina\) more compatible with the dual verb form? But 

why then didn’t he change the nominatives into vocatives? Did he perhaps have in 

mind the imperative dual of the third person yātām, that is even closer to the hypothetical starting point PS ✶ oṣuyātāṁ? Once invented, the verb yātam could replace RV vartta in R193 in the course of the transmission of the Mahābhāṣya. 

While an overall view of the various parallel texts suggests that the Mahābhāṣya 

changed the order of the last three words of this quotation, there is no agreement as to which monosyllabic word is involved here. Mahābhāṣya ca supports to some extent Lelli’s \(2020, 49\) choice to adopt the reading ca of the Odishan manuscripts in the PS 

text. Note, however, that both the Kashmirian manuscript of the PS and ĀśvŚS 4.12.2 

have tu ‘then, but’ \(German ‘doch’\) instead, which Bhattacharya \(1997, 796\) prefers. 

\(26\) R237 gā vo neṣṭāt vs. ĀpŚS 11.19.8 gnāvo neṣṭrād iti neṣṭāram ‘\[He calls\] the neṣṭar priest with the words: “O you, who are accompanied by the wives of 

the gods, \[drink\] from the cup of the neṣṭar\!”.’ See also BaudhŚS 7.9:214.16, 

KātyŚS 9.8.13, and MānŚSm 2.3.6.17 \( gnāvo neṣṭrīyo neṣṭrād iti neṣṭāram\). 

The actual source of this Mahābhāṣya quotation might be RVKh 5.7.5c, where grāvo neṣṭrāt as printed by Scheftelowitz \(1906: 148\) and Bhise \(1995: 208\) probably should be corrected to gnāvo neṣṭrāt. Ultimately, the wording of this piece of text depends on RV 1.15.3b: gnā́vo néṣṭaḥ píba r̥túnā ‘O you, who are accompanied by the wives of the gods, O neṣṭar, drink at the right time\!’

\(27\) R387 pativatī taruṇavatsā \(and R388 pativatnī taruṇavatsā\) vs. PS 14.2.7c antarvatīs taruṇavatsā ghr̥tācīḥ ‘\[the waters,\] pregnant, having a young calf, dripping with ghee’. 

At first glance, it might seem unlikely that the quoted PS pāda is really the source of this quotation. On the other hand, the bahuvrīhi taruṇavatsa- is a hapax legome-

**340** 

Thomas Zehnder

nenon, and, more importantly, the relevant Aṣṭādhyāyī sūtra \(4.1.32 antarvatpati-vator nuk\) deals with the motion \(motio generis\) of the two adjectives antárvant- 

‘pregnant’ and pátivant- ‘having a husband, married, замуж’. In light of this, one could suspect that someone mixed up the two adjectives and placed the wrong one 

into the quotation. For the analogical feminine forms with additional -n- described by Pāṇini, see Debrunner \(1954: 414–415\). Antárvatnī- is, among other places, attested at MSm 4.2.9:31.2 and quoted at Mahābhāṣya R698 \( sāntarvatnī devān upait 

‘pregnant, she approached the gods’\), while pativatnī- is now found three times in the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā \(PS 2.66.5d, PS 8.10.10c and PS 18.10.3a\). 

\(28\) R426 pūrvyā́ viduḥ vs. PS 11.3.6d brahmāṇaḥ pūrvyā viduḥ ‘the ancient brahmans know \[you\]’ \(∼ ŚS 19.34.6d brāhmaṇā́ḥ pūrvyā́ viduḥ\). 

The correction of the Mahābhāṣya text pūrvyā viśaḥ \(thus Rau 1985: 47\) to pūrvyā́ 

viduḥ and the identification with the Atharvaveda passage follow Rau \(1993: 114\). 

Rau does not make an analogous correction for R423 pūrvā viśaḥ ‘the former clans’, which I could not trace. 

\(29\) R439a 

pra ṇaḥ śūdraḥ pra ṇa ācāryaḥ pra ṇo rājā pra ṇo vr̥trahā vs. PS 19.38.15ab pra ṇaḥ śūdra utāryaḥ pra ṇo rājota vr̥trahā ‘Let the śūdra and the ārya and the chieftain, the slayer of Vr̥tra, \[. . . hand over our sacrificial fee\] to us.’

This quotation is added6 to the relevant material by Rau \(1987: 195\): “Ohne Zweifel ist der Text des Mahābhāṣya an der ausgehobenen Stelle korrupt und nach AV\(P\) 

herzustellen.” This case is not included in the list in §2.1. above, as it does not appear in Rau \(1985\), to which this list refers. 

\(30\) R454 pravaṇe yaṣṭavyam vs. MSp 1.10.7:147.13 pravaṇé yaṣṭavyàm ‘one should sacrifice on a slope’ \(∼ KS 36.2:69.15 pravaṇe yajeta ‘may he sacrifice on a slope’\). 

The source of this quotation is discovered by Rau \(1993: 114\). 

\(31\) R482 maghavā dātu maghavā dadātu vs. ABm 7.21.2 punar na indro maghavā 

dadātu | brahma punar iṣṭaṁ pūrtaṁ dāt svāheti ‘Let Indra, the bounteous one, give \[them\] back to us. He shall give \[us\] back the poetic formulation and

Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya **341**

the merit acquired through worship and donations. Svāhā\!’ The pāda punar 

na indro maghavā dadātu is also found at TB 2.5.3.1 and ĀśvŚS 2.10.16. 

The first variant quoted by the Mahābhāṣya with the imperative aorist \( maghavā 

dātu\) remains untraced – unless dātu ultimately represents the injunctive aorist dāt which immediately follows in the text of the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa. 

\(32\) R484 maṇivaḥ hiraṇyavaḥ vs. ŚS 20.128.6b, 7ab \(∼ RVKh 5.13.1b, 2b\) ámaṇivó áhiraṇyávaḥ . . . | . . . súmaṇiḥ súhiraṇyávaḥ ‘\[He who . . .\] wears no amulets and no gold \[jewellery\] . . . \[He who . . .\] wears fine amulets and fine gold \[jewellery\]’. 

Rau \(1985: 52\) refers to ŚāṅkhŚS 12.21.1–2, where these two stanzas also occur. 

Roth and Whitney \(1856: 447\) change the Śaunaka text at 6b to amaṇír áhiraṇyavān. 

Although this would rectify the metre and although amaṇiḥ is supported by the following sumaṇiḥ, these conjectures are scarcely justified. Patañjali, in fact, cites the two words as further examples for the suffix -vá- as contained in keśavá- ‘long-haired’, which confirms their interpretation as possessive va- adjectives ºmaṇiva- 

and ºhiraṇyava- \(see Debrunner 1954: 868, §701a\). 

\(33\) R509 mādhyaṁdina udgāyati vs. PS 16.115.2c \(∼ ŚS 9.6.46c\) madhyandina ud gāyati ‘noon strikes up a tune’. 

\(34\) R558 \+yāvad asty atraiṣaḥ saro janebhyaḥ kṛṇavat\+ – verderbt. 8,1,30 \[375,6: yāvad asty atraiṣaḥ \(?\) G A; a yāvaṁtas ta uṣaḥ traiyaḥ  altered to yāvaddattātreyaḥ; E g B yāvad asya \(or spa?\) nnaiṣaḥ; D yāvad asya traiṣaḥ\] = 8,1,66 \[379,8: yāvad asty atraiṣaḥ \(?\); G yāvad asty annai\(?\) ṣaḥ; A yavadasta-ṣaḥ; altered to yāvadastyatraiṣaḥ; a yāvad asta oṣaḥ; D yāvadamaḥ uṣa; E yāvad asya ukaḥ \(?\) altered to yāvad asya ūṣaḥ; g B yāvad asya uṣaḥ; for saro G A have śaro; for kṛṇavat G has kṛṇuyāt, A kṛṇuvat altered to kṛṇuyāt, B kṛpāvat\]: \(/\) vs. . . . 

PS 3.40.3 yāvad oṣaḥ śaro astvo janebhyaḥ kr̥ṇavad bhayam |

“As much as the reed, a burning projectile, makes people afraid, so let you, Shaft, burning, be renunciation here” \(text and tentative translation by Spiers 2020: 591\). 

Although the details are far from clear, this is likely to be a quotation of the first hemistich of stanza PS 3.40.4 in a disfigured shape. As much as I feel the PS text might need correction here, the main stumbling block being the twice-occurring oṣaḥ, the Mahābhāṣya does not immediately help. Pāda c is vaguely reminiscent of RV 

5.79.10a etā́vad véd uṣas tvám ‘That much or \[even more\], O Uṣas, you \[might give\].’

**342** 

Thomas Zehnder

The fact that Patañjali gives this example under an Aṣṭādhyāyī sūtra \(8.1.66\) 

dealing with the accentuation of finite verbs \(see Renou 1953: 451\) suggests that the accents were still preserved in the PS at his time – an observation that is not surprising. 

\(35\) R618 vr̥ṣā sahamānaṁ sāsahiḥ \[ vr̥ṣā samastu sāsahiḥ\] vs. RV 9.4.8b rayíṁ 

samátsu sāsahíḥ ‘\[flow\] towards wealth, victorious in contests’ ∼ SVK 2.404b vājiṁt samatsu sāsahiḥ vs. . . . SVK 2.910b yenā samatsu sāsahiḥ \(∼ RV 8.19.20b yénā samátsu sāsáhaḥ\). 

Vr̥ṣā samastu sāsahiḥ is a variant reading of the Mahābhāṣya \(see Rau 1985: 65\). Assuming that samastu is a transmission error for samatsu, we may adduce the sources mentioned above rather than PS 18.54.1a–4a \(PSK 18.30.1a–3a; ∼ ŚS 

17.1.1a–5a\) viṣāsahiṁ sahamānaṁ sāsahānam, as Rau does following Wackernagel \(1942: 181; “erinnert entfernt an”\). Note that sahamānaṁ is also suspicious because of the lack of case agreement between it and vr̥ṣā and sāsahiḥ. The word vr̥ṣā ‘bull’ 

at the begining of the Mahābhāṣya version might be attributed to an influence from RV 8.15.4b vŕ̥ṣaṇam pr̥tsú sāsahím ‘a victorious bull in battles’ and/or RV 5.33.4d vŕ̥ṣā samátsu dāsásya nā́ma cit ‘the bull \[has carved out\] even the name of the Dāsa in contests’. 

\(36\) R633 śarāve bapsati caruḥ vs. PS 6.8.5d śarkarā bapsatī cara “go . . . chewing on gravel” \(translation by Griffiths 2009: 103\). 

This instance, which involves considerable differences between the source and 

the quotation, is identified by Griffiths \(2009: 103\). It follows that the verb form in question is not the third person plural present bapsati ‘they chew’ \(as attested at RV 9.79.4c\), but the associated participle in the feminine bápsatī- \(as attested at RV 10.79.1d\). Rau’s \(1985: 100\) attempt to understand śarāve bapsati carum as “In einem Teller essen sie den Brei” must be considered outdated. 

\(37\) R659 sa ca na marati vs. PS 4.19.1d–7d sa cana marati mā vayaṁ marāma ‘He will surely not die. Do not let us die\!’

This PS pāda is a variant of RV 1.91.11c só cin nú ná marāti nó vayám marāma 

quoted by Rau \(1985, 68\). It is noticeable that the Kashmirian PS manuscript shares the hyper-marked \(long-vowel\) subjunctive aorist form marāti with the Rigveda, whereas the Odishan PS transmission and the Mahābhāṣya quotation agree in 

Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya **343**

having the regular subjunctive marati. In view of this distribution, K marāti might be attributed to influence from the Kashmirian RV tradition on this manuscript. 

\(38\) R707 supathintaraḥ vs. RV 9.107.2b surabhíntaraḥ ‘very fragrant’. 

Even if this cannot be proven unequivocally, it seems reasonable to assume that the Rigvedic word given is the source of this quotation. 

\(39\) R740 svarge loke ’psarasa enaṁ jāyā bhūtvopaśerata iti vs. PS 6.22.13ab svarge loke apsarasa ✶ enāñ jāyā bhūtvopaśerate “As wives, do the Apsarases lie down in the heavenly world with them \[who cook . . .\].” \(text and translation by 

Griffiths 2009, 245\). 

The Mahābhāṣya does not confirm Griffiths’ \(2009, 245\) emendation ✶ enāñ ‘them’, but shares the reading enaṁ ‘him’ found in the PS manuscripts, both those from Odisha and the one from Kashmir. The singular is also favoured by the Yajurvedic prose versions quoted by Rau \(1985, 76\), i.e. KSp 21.2:39.8 apsarsaḥ . . . patnyo bhūtvā . . . yajamānam upa śerate ‘the Apsarases . . . having become his wives . . . 

lie down with the sacrificer’ and TSp 5.3.7.2 apsarása eváinam . . .  úpa śere ‘the Apsarases . . . lie down with him’. 

\(40\) R760 hradayyā āpaḥ vs. PS 15.15.5a āpo ✶ hradyāḥ ‘the waters of the lake’. 

The emendation ✶ hradyāḥ for Odisha hr̥dyāḥ, Kashmir dadyāś is proposed by Lelli \(2020: 179\). 

Whether this PS passage – despite the reverse word order – is indeed the source of the Mahābhāṣya quotation is debatable. In any case, it is likely that the same noun phrase is present in both instances. With regard to the relational adjective, PS ✶ hradya- is the expected form \(base hradá- m.\), whereas Mahābhāṣya hradayya- seems to be influenced by hr̥dayyà- ‘of the heart’ attested at e.g. PS 2.90.1b \(base hŕ̥daya- n.\). 

**4 Conclusions**

**4.1** In the previous chapter, a fair amount of new sources were added to Rau’s collection, namely the 22 cases dealt with in \(18\) to \(40\), not counting \(29\) R439a. In 15 

of these instances, the source was discovered in the PS.

As for possible improvements of the PS text resulting from quotations in the 

Mahābhāṣya, it must be admitted that the harvest is modest.7 Our material includes just six cases with at least potential relevance:

\(18\) R021, PS 20.40.6a \(25\) R192, PS 15.1.9c

\(21\) R128, PS 1.71.3b 

\(34\) R558, PS 3.40.3ab

\(22\) R148, PS 19.34.15a \(39\) R740, PS 6.22.13b

**4.2** Let us now briefly consider to what extent the ratio of untraced sources of the Vedic quotations in the Mahābhāṣya may allow us to estimate how much Vedic text 

has been lost since Patañjali’s time. This question is raised by Rau for the analogous situation of the Kāśikāvr̥tti:

\(41\) “Von den knapp 1200 Zitaten sind über ein Drittel in unseren vedischen 

Texten nicht nachzuweisen. . . . Darf man daraus schließen, daß ebenso viel 

von ihnen seit dem 7. Jh. n. Chr. verlorengegangen ist?” \(Rau 1993: 108\). 

In the case of the Mahābhāṣya, Rau’s figures would have been 275 out of the total of 763 quotations, i.e. 36 % or approximately the same as the third he notes for the Kāśikāvr̥tti. My own update of this count reduces the 275 untraced items by the 16 

cases listed in §2.2. \(not counting \(5\) R199\) and the 22 cases listed in chapter 3. to 237 \(31 %\). 

**4.3** The reasons why we cannot trace a considerable number of the quotations from the Mahābhāṣya in the Vedic texts available to us may be manifold. They start with the fact that it is not always so easy to tell what should be considered as Vedic in the Mahābhāṣya. For example, Rau’s \(1985: 60\) R569 yo jajāgāra . . . , an apparent mantra variant of R570 yó jāgā́ra . . .  ‘he who is awake’ \(= RV 5.44.14a\), is commented on by Renou \(1953, 448\) with “le fictif jajāgāra . . . sans mention védique”. 

While jajāgāra is actually attested in the epics \(Mahābhārata 1.138.31\), there is little to suggest that such a secondary perfect was part of the Vedic grammatical system. 

**4.4** However, for those working on the basis of Rau \(1985\), the most significant reduction in untraced quotations results from the less rigorous approach to identifying a Vedic source that I applied to the quotations from the PS in §2.2. above. 

This view, that the quotations in the Mahābhāṣya are very often approximate, is 

espoused by Renou in particular:

**7** This result is in line with Rau’s findings \(1985: 102\): “Textverbesserungen zu vedischen Werken: Hier ist die aus dem Mahābhāṣya zu gewinnende Beute gering.” 

Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya **345**

\(42\) “. . . il faut relever encore que les citations védiques du Bhāṣya sont, plus d’une fois, approximatives . . . ; il y a peu de vraisemblance que P\[a\]t\[añjali\] 

ait puisé à quelque recension perdue.” \(Renou 1953: 430\). 

Rau’s approach, on the other hand, seems to be overcautious in most cases. The 

following example is found in the Paspaśā \(10.2\), Patañjali’s introduction to his magnum opus:

\(43\) R546 vede | yad vo revatī revatyaṁ tad ūṣa . . . iti vs. KSm 1.8:4.3 yad vo revatī 

revatyam ‘the abundant \[thing\] that you have, O bountiful ones’ and RV 

4.51.4d saptā́sye revatī revád ūṣá ‘\[the course on which\] you, O bountiful ones \(i.e. the Dawns\), have become abundantly bright \[at . . . and\] at the seven-mouthed one’. 

I am inclined to agree with Renou \(1953, 428\) when he describes this quotation as 

“. . . une contamination entre le début d’un yajus de la KS. et le mantra précité du RV.”, although it is not easy to assess at which stage this contamination occurred. 

In any case, Rau’s \(1985: 98\) alternative suggestion to simply correct the text of the Paspaśā to vede | saptāsye revatī revad ūṣa does not seem to do justice to the situation. 

**4.5** In some cases, it looks as though the author of the Mahābhāṣya himself was careless with Vedic passages – abbreviated them as it were – because only a certain part was important to him in the particular context. Examples \(44\) and \(45\) are 

candidates for this:

\(44\) R389 patīmān iti  vs. KātyŚSm 10.7.14 br̥haspatimān ‘accompanied by Br̥haspati’. 

The long ī might be explained as a perseveration from the immediately preceding word tviṣīmān ‘vehement’. 

\(45\) R265 jāye svo rohāvehi vs. TS 1.7.9.1 jā́ya éhi súvo róhāva róhāva hí súvaḥ 

‘\[The sacrificer says:8\] “O wife, come, let us ascend to the celestial light. \[She **8** For the additions in this translation see ĀpŚS 18.5.9–10: jāya ehīti yajamānaḥ patnīm āman-trayate rohāva hītītarā praty āha.

answers:\] “Let us indeed ascend to the celestial light.” ’ ∼ KS 14.1:201.2 pátnī́3 

svò rohāvéhi svò rohāvéhi ‘\[The scrificer says:\] “O wife, let us ascend to the celestial light. Go\!” \[She answers:\] “Let us ascend to the celestial light. Go\!” ’ 

See also MS 1.11.3:163.13, MānŚS 7.1.3.3 and others. 

\(46\) R189 ehi tvaṁ jāye svo rohāva – º rohāveti E B

These two quotations are part of the dialogue between the sacrificer and his 

wife during the Yajurvedic ceremony of ascending the sacrificial post \(see e.g. 

Amano 2009: 419–422\). With \(45\), the Mahābhāṣya seems to have the TS version 

in mind, not only because it uses the word jāyā́- to denote the wife \(vs. KS pátnī-, the MS has no vocative here\), but especially since it adduces this passage to illustrate the rule dealt with in Aṣṭādhyāyī 8.1.56, which states that finite verbs are accented when a particle like hí ‘for, indeed’ follows. However, the actual text of the Mahābhāṣya contradicts this connection, for it reads rohāvehi \[ rohāva ihi\] 

as preserved in the KS and MS versions and thus does not contain the particle 

hí, as does the TS version. This conundrum might be solved by assuming that rohāva hí was secondarily changed to rohāvehi during the transmission of the Mahābhāṣya. Incidentally, the reading KS, MS rohāvéhi disproves Rau’s cautious proposal \(1985: 32; “lies ºrohāvaihi ?”\) to restore ehi \[ ā ihi\] ‘come here\!’. Rather, we are dealing with ihi ‘go\!’ \(in the sense of German Los\! \). 

**4.6** Other discrepancies between the potential sources and the Mahābhāṣya are more likely to be due to changes during the transmission of the latter. The long list of suggestions for emending the Mahābhāṣya text drawn up by Rau \(1985: 98–101\) 

testifies to how common this is. And this list can easily be extended to include 

further material, see e.g. \(26\) R237 above. I am even inclined to add the following case here:

\(47\) R235 gāṁ ghnanti gāṁ pra dīvyanti gāṁ sabhāsadbhya upa haranti  vs. KS 

8.7:90.10–11 gāṁ ghnanti tāṁ vi dīvyante tāṁ sabhāsadbhya upa haranti 

‘They slay the cow, they gamble her away, they bring her to those sitting in 

the assembly.’

Wackernagel \(1942: 180\) lists this passage under the heading “Sonst unbekannte 

Varianten zu vedischen Texten”, and Rau \(1985: 29\) applies his sign \(/\) for untraced quotations. However, it is certainly a bit of a stretch to suppose the former existence of an unknown recension that offers exactly the version found in the Mahābhāṣya. 

**4.7** All in all, the approximate third of the Vedic quotations in the Mahābhāṣya for which we find no Vedic source, or only an imprecise one, is significantly reduced on 

Quotations from the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya **347**

closer examination by a multitude of possible explanations. In my view, it becomes probable that a potential loss of Vedic texts since Patañjali’s time is not a major factor here – that is, not now that the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā has been largely recovered.
