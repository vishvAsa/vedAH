**The Three Grand Divisions of the Śaunakasamhitā from a Lexico-Statistic Perspective**

**Abstract:** The Śaunakasaṃhitā was divided into three “grand divisions” by Whitney and Lanman, its most influential interpreters: short hymns \(kāṇḍas 1–7\), long 

hymns of miscellaneous subject matter \(kāṇḍas 8–12\), and hymns “characterized 

each by unity of subject” \(kāṇḍas 13–18\), with kāṇḍas 1–7 constituting the core 

of the collection. Witzel agrees with these divisions but adds a temporal aspect, proposing that ŚS 1–5 and 8–12 are older than ŚS 13–18. This paper revisits these earlier approaches using computational and corpus linguistics, focusing on vocabulary subsets and their correlation with Whitney and Lanman’s divisions. 

**Introduction**

In the introduction to their translation of the Śaunakasaṃhitā \(ŚS1\), Whitney and Lanman split the text of ŚS 1–18 into three “grand divisions”. These divisions consist of “short” \(kāṇḍas 1–7\) and “long hymns of miscellaneous subjects” \(kāṇḍas 8–12\), and of hymns “characterized each by unity of subject” \(kāṇḍas 13–18\), respectively \(Whitney and Lanman 1905: cxxvii\). Lanman claims that the first division \(kāṇḍas 

1–7\) is probably the “most characteristic part of it all, and \[. . .\] books i.–vi. are very likely the original nucleus of the whole collection.” \(Whitney and Lanman 1905: 

cxlii\). The introductory notes to the individual kāṇḍas do not discuss further linguistic evidence that supports this claim. It thus appears that Lanman’s conclusion is largely based on content and on the ordering principle of increasing numbers of stanzas, as generally applied when studying the structure of the Rigveda \(see Oldenberg 1888: 242; Renou 1947: 63–65; Insler 1998: 19–20\). 

Witzel \(1997: 275–284\) agrees with Whitney and Lanman’s “grand divisions”, 

but introduces a further temporal component. Based on cultural as well as lin-

guistic features, Witzel proposes that kāṇḍas 1–5 constitute the oldest part of the ŚS, while ŚS 8–12 are later, but still earlier than the Yajurveda prose \(Witzel 1997: 280–281\). ŚS 6–7 may be interpolated in the first grand division, and ŚS 13–18 may **1** This paper uses the abbreviations defined in Griffiths \(2009: 453–456\).

be contemporaneous with the TS or the earlier parts of the AB \(see Witzel 1997: 281; also see Renou 1955 on the prose parts contained therein\). As the ŚS is often used as a reference point for post-Rigvedic linguistic developments \(see, for example, Arnold 1897; Witzel 1995 for a discussion and possible fallacies\), it is worthwhile assessing if the structure that was proposed by Whitney and Lanman and largely 

adapted in later research \(e.g. Griffiths 2003: 2009\) can be corroborated in a lexico-statistic study. 

While it is possible to detect changes in the morphosyntax of post-Rigvedic San-

skrit \(see, for instance, Lanman 1872; Hoffmann 1967\), Wackernagel \(1896: XIV–

XXVII\) claims that the most important linguistic developments after the RV took 

place on the level of vocabulary. Combining Wackernagel’s claim with the assump-

tion that the oldest part of the ŚS largely coincides with its first Grand Division, one may expect a higher ratio of old words in this part of the ŚS than in its presumably later divisions. Note that the term ‘word’ refers to the uninflected lexical form \(lemma\) throughout this paper, if not specified otherwise. 

In order to assess this hypothesis, this paper examines how words that exclu-

sively occur in the Rigvedic and Mantra periods of Vedic Sanskrit as defined by 

Witzel \(1997: 268\) are distributed over the ŚS. This lexical subset is called Rigvedic-Mantra vocabulary \(henceforth: RMV\) in the rest of this paper. If words con-

tained in the RMV are distributed over the ŚS in a way that coincides with the 

\(chronological\) structure proposed by Witzel \(1997\), this finding provides addi-

tional lexico-statistic evidence for the claim that the Grand Divisions indeed correspond to a historical stratification of the ŚS. 

This paper examines the distribution of RVM words over the ŚS from two per-

spectives. In the first perspective, it examines how the RMV is distributed over the ŚS alone. As intertextual links play an important role in the Vedic corpus, the second perspective considers the joint distribution of the RMV over the RV and the ŚS; this means the distribution arising when RMV words occurring in the ŚS as well as the 

RV are interpreted as links between the two texts. While such a joint distribution could also have been created for the ŚS and any other text from the Mantra period, the RV appears to be especially suited for this kind of evaluation, because previous research has claimed that there exist relevant connections between sections of the ŚS and some parts of the RV \(esp. RV 10\) on the levels of textual content and linguistics. Moreover, the Family Books RV 2–7 are often assumed to represent the oldest layer of Vedic, and strong lexical connections between the ŚS and RV 2–7 may help to sort out presumably older parts of the ŚS. 

The idea of using lexical distributions for studying the stratification of texts is not new. Arnold \(1905: 32–41\) compiled lists of words which, in his opinion, can 

serve to indicate the dates of composition of various parts of the RV. Notably, many of the words indicative of a younger date are selected on the basis of socio-cul-

The Three Grand Divisions of the Śaunakasamhitā from a Lexico-Statistic Perspective **85**

tural ideas and therefore semantic criteria; e.g. terms relating to the daily life or to philosophy, two topics which are implicitly assumed not to occur in the hieratic core of the RV. While Wüst \(1928\) uses lexicographic information as one of several criteria for stratifying the RV, Poucha \(1942, 1944\) solely relies on lexico-statistics in his study of the RV. The author bases his results on Arnold’s and Wüst’s lists as well as on his own linguistic intuition \(Poucha 1942: 105ff.\). These previous studies met with a reserved reception in the scholarly community. One central point of 

concern was that the authors did not sufficiently consider the interactions between the content of the Rigvedic hymns and their socio-cultural background on one side and the lexical composition on the other \(see, e.g., Edgerton 1929 and Gonda 1975: 28\). It may be added that statistical tests of significance are preferable to simple counting of lexical units, as done by all mentioned authors, although this point has only been mentioned in more recent reviews of their work \(Fosse 1997\). 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the 

data used for this paper and deals with the question of how parallel passages can be detected and removed before compiling the RMV. It also gives a short overview 

of how parallel textual passages are jointly distributed over the RV and the ŚS. The distribution of the RMV over the ŚS and its joint distribution over the ŚS and RV 

are examined in the third section, which also discusses how the influence of topics on the lexical distribution can be estimated using quantitative methods. The final section summarizes this paper. 

**Textual Parallels**

**Creating the Data**

The lexicographic data that are used in this paper are extracted from the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit \(DCS\).2 The definition of the literary periods used for constructing the RMV follows the listing presented by Witzel \(1997: 273\). Apart from RV, ŚS, RVKhil and VSM, the Mantra parts of the MS and the TS according to Keith \(1914: 

xlvii–lxvi\), as far as they are contained in the DCS, provide words for the RMV. Note that the RMV contains the complete vocabulary of ŚS 1–18, although parts of the 

ŚS are later than the Mantra period according to Witzel. As this paper investigates **2** http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/index.php. An up-to-date dump of this database in ConL-

LU format is available at https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/dcs/data/conllu. – 

The DCS currently contains the following early Vedic texts \(✶: only parts of the text are contained in the DCS\): RV \(see Hellwig et al. 2018\), ŚS 1–18, ✶RVKhil, ✶VSM, ✶MS, ✶TS.

whether the stratification proposed by Whitney, Lanman and Witzel can be repro-

duced when looking at lexico-statistics, their hypotheses should not influence the selection of the data, and parts of the ŚS that are presumably later have thus been intentionally included as sources of the RMV. 

While parallel passages and their textual variants can give important insights 

into the mutual relationship between the RV, the two extant śākhās of the AV and 

other Vedic texts \(Oldenberg 1888: 320ff.; Bloomfield and Edgerton 1979; Renou 

1947: 69; Griffiths 2009: XXXIV–XXXVII; Mucciarelli 2015\), they are less useful when studying the RMV, because words contained in parallel passages generate false negatives, when they occur in post-Mantra texts.3 Therefore, it is crucial to identify parallel passages and remove them from the corpus before creating lexical statistics. 

This paper combines two methods for parallel detection. The first method is a 

modified version of the Levenshtein algorithm \(Levenshtein 1966\) which operates 

on continuous word embeddings \(Mikolov et al. 2013\). It achieves the highest recall but tends to produce false positive results as well. The second method uses the digital version of Bloomfield’s Vedic Concordance \(Bloomfield 1906, as updated by Franceschini 2008\). Each record of the VC is split into the cited text and its occurrences. 

All but the first occurrence, which is, somehow mechanically, assumed to represent the source of the citation, are searched in the DCS using fuzzy string comparison. If a citation can be traced in the DCS using either of these methods, the lexical annotation corresponding to this match is ignored when constructing the RMV. 

**Evaluation**

Although parallel passages are not the main topic of this paper, their distribution shows some similarities to that of the RMV words, and is therefore briefly discussed. 

For reasons similar to those given in the introduction, this paper concentrates on the distributions of parallels between the ŚS and the RV: Links connecting the ŚS 

with the purportedly older parts of the RV may be helpful for understanding the 

chronological structure of the ŚS, and RV 10 is another important source of Atharvanic material apart from the ŚS itself. 

Figure 1 shows the distribution of parallel text lines detected in the RV and 

the ŚS. The horizontal x-axis displays the ten books \(maṇḍalas\) of the RV. The 

distances between the ticks on this axis, which indicate the start of each book, 

are proportional to the number of text lines contained in the respective book. The **3** If a later text such as a ritual sūtra cites a mantra that contains a word of the RMV, and the text is not labeled as a citation, this word may be excluded from the RMV, thus producing a false negative. 

The Three Grand Divisions of the Śaunakasamhitā from a Lexico-Statistic Perspective **87**

vertical axis displays the books of the ŚS and is organized in the same way.4 On 

the whole, the algorithm detects 1,123 parallels between the RV and ŚS. Because 

an unfiltered display of this sparse matrix would make it difficult to detect interesting trends, neighboring parallels are clustered using Hartigan’s leader cluster algorithm \(Hartigan 1975\) with a maximal radius of 50 lines of text. While the 

radius of a circle in Figure 1 shows the extent of a cluster, its hue indicates how many parallels are contained in each cluster, with darker colours indicating 

higher numbers. 

The separate plots at the top and right margins of Figure 1 visualize smoothed 

estimates of the marginal densities of the underlying count matrix \(see Fn. 4; 

top: RV; right: ŚS\). These marginal distributions record the smoothed sums of the columns \(RV\) and rows \(ŚS\) of this matrix. They show where and how often parallels occur in the RV \(top\) and the ŚS \(right\), without considering the distribution in the other text. 

Figure 1 provides a picture of the mutual relationship between the RV and ŚS 

that agrees with results of previous research, especially as reported by Bloomfield \(1899: 46\) and Witzel \(1997: 282\). The clusters in the main plotting area and the density plot at the top margin show that most parallels occur in book 10 of the 

RV. This book is generally assumed to belong to a younger layer of the RV, both 

on account of its linguistic features and its Atharvanic content \(see e.g., Oldenberg 1888: 270; Witzel 1995: 195; Witzel 1997: 282\). While parallels occurring in RV 1–7 

are quite evenly distributed, there are virtually no parallels with RV 9. Since Soma, the central topic of RV 9, plays no major role in the ŚS, the absence of citations from this book is not surprising. 

While the RV marginal can be explained as a unimodal distribution having its 

peak in RV 10, the marginal plot for the ŚS \(right margin of Figure 1\) is approximately bimodal. The first peak corresponds to ŚS 6 and especially 7, which contain the majority of parallels with the RV. As Witzel \(1997: 276\) has pointed out, ŚS 6 

and 7 may be interpolations in the ŚS, and Figure 1 supports the claim that they 

occupy a special position in the first Grand Division. Notably, parallels with RV 1–7 

concentrate in ŚS 7, while ŚS 1–6 share most parallels with RV 10 \(as does ŚS 7\). The density of parallels drops sharply after ŚS 7, leaving the plotting area for ŚS 8–12 

almost empty. This sharp break may be due primarily to the change in content, 

as the second grand division \(ŚS 8–12\) mainly deals with speculative \(“mystic” in the terminology of Whitney and Lanman 1905\) topics. The frequency of parallels

increases again in the third grand division \(ŚS 13–18\), which Witzel \(1997: 277\) calls the “Gṛhya collection”, and reaches the second peak in the funeral hymns of ŚS 18, which mixes Rigvedic with AV material. 

**The Lexical Distribution**

**Creating the Data**

When compiling the RMV, all verbal forms are subjected to a special treatment. 

Modern editions of accented texts often separate preverbs from verbs if the verb 

occurs in a non-subordinate clause. In addition, tmesis is widespread in old Vedic texts. As annotations that reliably connect preverbs with verbs are currently only available for the RV \(Hellwig et al. 2018\), verbal forms with preverbs, which occur, for example, in subordinate clauses and unaccented texts, are reduced to their 

verbal roots, and all preverbs are excluded from the RMV. As a consequence, the 

argumentation presented in this paper relies heavily on non-verbal forms, because only a few verbal roots are restricted to the period of the RMV. Similar considerations lead to the exclusion of the particle cid ‘even’, which is part of the indefinite quantifier kaścid- written as one lemma in the DCS database. As this lemma is split into kaś cid in some of the texts in the DCS, the particle cid as well as the quantifier kaścid- are excluded from the lexical analysis. 

The RMV is generated by fuzzy set intersection, and textual parallels are 

detected in an unsupervised manner. Even if a scholarly curated resource such as 

the VC is used, some later citations of Vedic mantras may not be detected. There-

fore, words are included in the RMV, if at least 95% of their occurrences in the DCS 

are contained in the RV, ŚS, RVKhil and the Mantra portions of the MS and the TS. 

The RMV created in this way contains 204 nouns, 189 adjectives, 86 verbs and 31 

indeclinables. 

**Distribution over the ŚS**

Figure 2 shows how words that occur in the ŚS and at least one other RMV text are distributed over the ŚS. The horizontal axis is structured in the same way as the vertical axis in Figure 1 and shows the books of the ŚS. Grey vertical bars summarize statistics about RMV words occurring in each text line of the ŚS. The heights of these bars are calculated by assigning the same total mass to each word type, distributing 

**90**

this mass over all occurrences of the word in the ŚS and summing up all fractions obtained for each line. To motivate this approach, consider, for example, the two RMV words kimīdín-, the name of an inimical creature, and mákṣā- ‘bee’. While mákṣā- occurs only once at ŚS 9.1.17a, the term kimīdín- occurs 21 times in ŚS 1–5 

and the second grand division. If word statistics would be based on the distribution of word tokens, the word mákṣā- would contribute the sum of 1 \(one occurrence\) to the full distribution of RMV words, while kimīdín- would contribute the sum of 21. In this way, the overall distribution would become biased towards frequent 

RMV words, which would be in opposition to the general aim of this paper, namely 

studying the distribution of word types in the ŚS. In order to avoid such a bias, the single occurrence of mákṣā- obtains the sum of 1, i.e. its complete mass, while each occurrence of kimīdín- only obtains 121 ≈ 0.048. The heights of the bars in Figure 2 

are the sums of these fractions. 

In addition to the source data indicated by the grey vertical bars, Figure 2 also displays a smoothed trend line that summarizes the source data. Judging from this smoothed trend, the plot exhibits a clear separation between the first grand division on one hand and the second and third grand divisions on the other. Starting 

directly with ŚS 8, the trend line drops to a lower level and remains in this state until the end of ŚS 18. The division of the ŚS into two parts that becomes evident from Figure 2 can be corroborated with a statistical test of significance that compares the heights of the grey bars in the first grand division with those in grand divisions 2 and 3.5

**Joint Distribution over the RV and ŚS**

Although many details remain disputed, Vedic studies have produced a coarse 

internal chronology of the RV: RV 2–7 are generally assumed to belong to the oldest layer of the text, while RV 10 is considered to be a late addition \(see e.g. Witzel 1997: 262–265\). These ideas about its chronology may be helpful when studying the structure of the ŚS. 

To create the joint distribution of the RMV in the RV and the ŚS, a link between 

a text line in the RV and a line in the ŚS is established if these two lines share at least one word from the RMV. If multiple words are shared by the two lines, the strength **5** As the source data do not meet the requirements for a parametric t-test, the difference in means is tested using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The alternative hypothesis of this test claims that the vertical lines in grand division 1 are denser and higher than those in grand division 2 and 3. The test produces a highly significant test statistics of W = 10126000, p < 2.2 e–16.

of the link is increased proportionally.6 This linking strength will be called density in the following. 

Figure 3, which is organized in the same way as Figure 1, displays such densi-

ties for the RV \(horizontal axis\) and the ŚS \(vertical axis\). The highest values in the RV marginal distribution \(top margin of Figure 3\) can be observed for RV 1.50 to 

RV 7, i.e., the core of the text according to Oldenberg \(1888\), as well as RV 10. As the Family Books are generally assumed to contain most of the oldest Rigvedic material and RV 10 probably belongs to the Mantra period, this result is not surprising. It shows, however, that the approach used in this paper is able to detect meaningful segmentations. The density drops to a generally lower level towards the end of RV 7, although RV 8 contains a sub-peak, which roughly corresponds to the Vālakh-ilya hymns in RV 8.49–59. 

The marginal distribution of the ŚS \(plot at the right margin of Figure 3\) largely corresponds to Figure 2. This distribution is ragged, but the highest RMV density is found in ŚS 1–7. The density drops sharply in ŚS 8–9, i.e. the start of the second grand division, as could be observed for the parallels and in Figure 2. The joint distribution, i.e., the grey values in the main plotting area of Figure 3 is dominated by the textual segments that can be observed in the marginals. The strongest links are found 

between ŚS 1–7 and ŚS 18 on one hand and RV 1.50 to RV 7 and RV 10 on the other. 

**The Influence of the Textual Content**

The results visualized in Figure 3 do not take the content or topics of the text sections into account. This is a relevant drawback of the evaluation, since even low-level linguistic features such as case or phoneme distributions are often correlated with the topic of a text passage \(see Hellwig 2017\). This caveat is even more important when studying the distribution of lexemes, the choice of which is directly influenced by the content of a text \(see e.g. Edgerton’s review of Wüst’s approach, Edgerton 1929\). 

In order to address this issue, this paper evaluates an approach based on 

hidden topic assignments. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation \(LDA\) topic model \(see Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003\) is used to automatically determine the topics of all hymns of the RV and the ŚS. An LDA model takes the frequencies of words in each hymn as 

input, and predicts the most probable distribution over a set of unnamed topics, 

**6** The linking strength is stored in an s × r matrix, and updated on the basis of type information. 

Let nS, nR denote the absolute frequencies of a word in the ŚS and the RV, respectively. As the word creates nS ⋅ nR links between the ŚS and the RV, the corresponding cells of this matrix are updated with the value 1  . – Also see the related procedure for estimating corpus densities in Hellwig nS** **⋅** ** nR

the number of which must be specified a priori. The meaning of each topic can be 

determined a posteriori by inspecting the most prominent words assigned to it 

\(not done in this paper\). As many hymns are comparatively short, often consisting only of a few lines of text, the Sanskrit words of each hymn are supplemented by 

their lemmatized English translations, and plain LDA is applied to this joint set of lexical data.7 After the training has finished, each hymn from the RV and the 

ŚS is described by a probability distribution over a set of anonymous topics so 

that hymns containing similar content should obtain a similar topic distribution. 

The Hellinger distance, which ranges from 0 \(completely different\) to 1 \(identical distributions\) is used for quantifying the similarity of these discrete topic distributions. 

These pairwise similarity values are now used to quantify the influence of 

topics on the word wise similarities plotted in Figure 3, based on the following intuition. If the distribution in Figure 3 were solely conditioned on topics, it should be possible to predict the intensity and distribution of its grey scale levels, when only the topic similarities would be known. A simple predictive model that performs 

this task uses least square linear regression.8 Using the values predicted by such a regression, the individual errors or residuals can be found by subtracting the 

predicted from the true density values. A histogram of these residuals shows that they follow a normal distribution \(not reported in this paper\). The residuals are therefore split into three groups based on their mean and standard deviation:

– The group ‘high’ contains pairs of hymns whose residuals are larger than the 

mean plus one standard deviation. These hymns have linking word densities 

that are higher than could be expected from the topic similarities. 

**7** For the purpose of training the model, each hymn constitutes a separate document. The topic distributions are given the final Φ values. A set of 50 frequent particles, auxiliary verbs \( bhū-, as-\) and pronouns were removed before training. The model uses 15 topics, 5,000 training iterations and a flat Dirichlet prior, which is not optimized during the training. 

**8** The topic similarities are calculated for pairs of hymns, while the word densities in Figure 3 are extracted from text lines. In order to bring both distributions into a common format, the word densities are averaged over hymns for the regression experiments. 

The model predicts the logarithm of the word densities. Visual inspection and goodness-of-fit tests of the histograms of the predictors and predicted values show that both sets of values are approximately normally distributed \(details not reported\). The visual inspection of the scatter plots of these variables shows no obvious trends in their variances, so that the requirement for homosce-dasticity seems to be met. Predictions are made by splitting the set of all elements with mij > 0 into 10 disjunct folds, training the regressor on 9 of them and then predicting the values in the tenth holdout set \(tenfold cross-validation\). Slopes and biases of all regressions are statistically highly significant with p-values < 0.01 \(details not reported\). 

The Three Grand Divisions of the Śaunakasamhitā from a Lexico-Statistic Perspective **95**



– The group ‘mean’ contains all pairs of hymns whose word densities can be pre-

dicted with good accuracy when their topic similarity is known. 



– The group ‘low’ is the symmetric equivalent of ‘high’. 

Figure 4 and Figure 5 are based on the same word densities as Figure 3, but con-

sider only those hymns that are contained in the groups ‘low’ \(Figure 4\) and ‘high’ 

\(Figure 5\). The plots allow for three relevant observations. First, grand division 1 

of the ŚS is split into two parts. The kāṇḍas ŚS 1–5 have lower word densities than could be expected from their content \(see Figure 4\), while the word densities in ŚS 

6–7 are higher than expected from the content \(see Figure 5\). Very tentatively, one may consider that ŚS 6–7 have a closer lexicographic connection to the range from RV 1.50 to RV 7 than ŚS 1–5. The neat separation of ŚS 1–5 and ŚS 6–7 thus seems 

to support the hypothesis that ŚS 6–7 may be interpolated in the first grand division. One should, however, keep in mind that ŚS 6–7 contain many short hymns for 

which the results of the LDA, i.e. the topic distributions, may not be well defined.9 

As the predictions are based on suboptimal values in such cases, the clear distinction between ŚS 1–5 on one hand and ŚS 6–7 on the other may thus also be due to 

algorithmic issues. 

The area corresponding to ŚS 8–16 is virtually empty in Figure 4 and underpop-

ulated in Figure 5. As pairs of hymns that fall into the group ‘mean’ are not plotted in these figures, this result indicates that the word densities ŚS 8–16, i.e. major parts of grand divisions 2–3, conform to the expectation given by topic information. 

However, Figure 5 shows bands of higher values that appear to concentrate at the 

beginnings of individual kāṇḍas, and such a trend can be confirmed using a statistical test of significance \(details not reported\). Such a distribution may be related to an observation made by Bloomfield \(1899: 39\), who claims that the initial hymns of some kāṇḍas tend to be composed in a more elaborate style \(“loftier diction”; also see Griffiths 2009: LXXVI–LXXVII\) on related phenomena in PS 6\). 

**9** A closer inspection of the distributions generated for ŚS 6–7 shows that most of them are rather flat and thus differ from the predominantly unimodal distributions of longer hymns.

**Summary**

As Wackernagel has pointed out, lexical statistics may contain important clues for understanding linguistic developments in Vedic Sanskrit and thus for inferring 

chronological information from the surface forms of Vedic texts. While such an 

approach was pursued by several scholars for the RV, these scholars worked with 

manually compiled word lists they considered to be diachronically marked, a point often criticized in reviews of their work. In addition, they did not apply quantitative methods for evaluating and visualizing their results \(see the brief history of research in the introduction\). The present paper resumes these lexico-statistical investigations, but differs in two relevant aspects. First, the word list, called Rigveda-Mantra vocabulary \(RMV\) in this paper, is chosen in a purely data-driven 

fashion using corpus-linguistic methods. Second, the paper applies statistical tests of significance that support central claims, and it proposes a quantitative approach for estimating to what degree the lexical distributions are influenced by the content of the examined text passages. 

When this quantitative framework is applied to the ŚS, it provides support for 

some text-historical hypotheses brought forward by Whitney and Lanman \(1905\) 

and Witzel \(1997\). While the marginal distribution of the RMV over the ŚS clearly separates its first grand division from ŚS 8–18 \(see Figure 2\), the detailed examination of the joint distribution over the ŚS and the RV \(see Figure 3\) suggests that ŚS 

1–7 can be further differentiated into ŚS 1–5 on one hand and ŚS 6–7 on the other, thus substantiating text-historical claims made by Witzel \(1997\). A similarly clear differentiation between the grand divisions 2 and 3 does not emerge from the data. 

However, this result is not surprising under the two assumptions that \(1\) the RMV 

consists of old words, and \(2\) these two grand divisions are later than the first one. 

In this scenario, occurrences of RMV words should mainly be confined to the first grand division, and thus cannot help in revealing the structure of the purportedly later parts of the ŚS. 

The results presented in this paper are just the first step in exploring the dia-

chronic structure of the ŚS from a quantitative perspective. Two lines of research appear especially interesting to follow. First, the reservations brought forward 

against earlier lexico-statistic approaches still hold, and using topic models to deal with them yielded only mixed results. In order to obtain a more reliable data basis, it needs to be examined whether the words contained in the RMV allow for semantic alternation; in other words, if their selection is mainly due to the content of the Mantra stage texts they are extracted from, or if there exist real synonyms that 

were in use in \(roughly\) contemporaneous texts. A refined data basis should pref-

erably consist of the second type, i.e. words with semantic alternatives. The second line should concentrate on finding equivalents of the RMV that help to elucidate

the structure of the second and third grand division of the ŚS. Here, promising candidates may be present in the prose Samhitās, as already proposed by Witzel, or 

even the early Upaniṣads. This paper provides a simple, yet effective quantitative framework for pursuing both lines of research.
