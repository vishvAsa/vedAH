**The Neonatal Rites in the Paippalāda Śākhā: **

**The Jātakarmādyannaprāśanāntakarmāṇi **

**Section in the Karmapañjikā**

**Abstract:** There are seven basic rituals – jātasaṁsthā s – for a male brahmin in the Paippalāda tradition of the Atharvaveda. The Jātakarman is one of them for a 

newborn baby. The present paper examines the Jātakarmādyannaprāśanakarmāṇi 

rituals as prescribed in the Karmapañjikā, the paddhati text of this school. There are six rituals involved in the collective term Jātakarmādyannaprāśanakarmāṇi, 

namely Jātakarman, Sūtakāgnihomavidhi, Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa, 

Māsavṛddhikarman, Bahirniṣkramaṇa, and Annaprāśana. 

The paper comprises three parts. The first part brings out the features of all 

the neonatal rites in the Paippalāda tradition and their comparison with the rites in other Vedic traditions. The second parts presents observations on the style 

and priestly language of the Karmapañjikā. The third part contains the text of 

Jātakarmādyannaprāśanakarmāṇi section edited by collating respective folios of 

the five manuscripts of Karmapañjikā available for this section. This part also contains a translation of the Sanskrit text. 

**Introduction**

The Karmapañjikā \(KP\) is the Paddhati text, the ritual manual, of Paippalāda Atharvavedins residing in the eastern Indian states of Orissa and Jharkhand. It deals with the domestic rituals of this school. There are seven basic rituals – jātasaṁsthā s – 

for a Paippalādin Brahmin. These are: Vivāha \(wedding\), Garbhādhāna \(impregna-

tion\), Puṁsavana \(rite for obtaining a male child\), Jātakarman \(rite for a newborn baby\), Godāna \(first ritual shaving of a boy\), Upanayana \(Initiation\) and Āplavana \(ritual bath of a bachelor\).1

The rite of Jātakarman is dealt with in detail in the section named Jā-

takarmādyannaprāśanāntakarmāṇi in the KP. The name of this section is a col-

lective term that includes the rituals beginning with Jātakarman and concluding

with Annaprāśanāna. These six rituals are Jātakarman, Sūtakāgnihomavidhi, Sūry-

adarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa, Māsavarṣavṛddhi, Bahirniṣkramaṇa, and Annap-

rāśana. All these rites are to be performed for a newborn baby. The section will 

form chapter four of the second volume of the KP edition.2 

The present paper consists of three parts: 



Part I: The description of the neonatal rites in the Karmapañjikā. 



Part II: Observations on the style and language of the Karmapañjikā



Part III: The edited text and translation of the Karmapañjikā for the section 

under discussion



Part I discusses certain features of Paippalāda rituals, and I make an attempt 

to compare these with similar rites in other Vedic traditions. Part II discusses 

the peculiar style of the author of the KP and part III presents the text in the 

KP based on the collation of respective folios of the five manuscripts of the KP 

available for this section. These are Gu1: 78r–83v; Gu2: 81v–87v; Gu3: 86r–92r; 

Ku: 73v–78r and Ni: 65r–69r.3

**Part I  The Description of the Neonatal Rites **

**in the Karmapañjikā**

**I.1 Jātakarman**

\(Ritual to be performed immediately after birth of a child\) \[Ku 73v3–74v3\]

This rite is performed immediately after the birth of a child. There are two 

persons involved in the ritual, namely the kartṛ and yajamāna. The kartṛ is a performer, that is the performing priest. The yajamāna is the father of the newborn baby. 

**I.1.1 The Procedure of the Jātakarman Ritual **

The acts involved in the Paippalāda ritual are as follows: 

1. As soon as the baby is born, the performer looks at the baby with the recitation of the hymn संपशयरानाः \(PS 1.80\). 

**2** See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: xxxiii\). 

**3** For the sigla and the description of the manuscripts, see Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: xvi–xxx\), introduction item number 2 “Manuscripts”. In this paper, reference to Ku folios and lines is given in square brackets wherever necessary. This manuscript is available at https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/

The Neonatal Rites in the Paippalāda Śākhā 

[[401]]

2. The father of the baby performs Vṛddhiśrāddha. The Vṛddhiśrāddha is 

the worship of the forefathers on any auspicious occasion. It is also called 

Nāndīmukhaśrāddha or Nāndīśrāddha.4 The procedure of Vṛddhiśrāddha in 

the Paippalāda tradition is described in the Vivāha ritual of KP5. 

3. The father gives gifts such as a cow, land, gold etc. to the performing priest according to his ability. 

4. The performer recites Svastivācana. This involves the recitation of certain formulas that proclaim the auspiciousness of the day, well-being and prosperity.6 

5. The performer establishes the fire on the sthaṇḍila \(the ground prepared for establishing the fire\). The description of establishing the sthaṇḍila can be found in the seventh chapter named Dvividhastaṇḍilavidhāna of the first volume of 

the KP.7 

6. The performer establishes brahmapātra.8 The details of this act are found in the Pūrvatantra ritual, the fourth chapter of the first volume of the KP.9

7. The basic rituals of Pūrvatantra and Uttaratantra are mandatory in every 

jātasaṁsthā. The Pūrvatantra is the first part of the ritual that takes place before the main rite \( pradhānakarman\). The main rites are the jātasaṁsthā s. 

The Uttaratantra is the latter part of the ritual after the main rite. However, 

the Jātakarman rite is an exception to this rule. The acts in the Pūrvatantra 

up to the offerings of clarified butter are dropped in the Jātakarman. Some 

verses from the text named Paribhāṣā are cited by the author of the KP, in 

support of the omission of these acts. These verses state a practical reason for 

this omission: the baby will be hungry and will not wait until the completion of 

the lengthy ritual of the tantra. Therefore the tantra is dropped and the baby is given the breast of its mother. The ritual included in the Jātakarman is for this reason very brief. 

8. The performer makes a pāśa \(noose\) of mauñja grass and throws it on the head of the baby, and then removes it with his feet without recitation of any mantra. 

Holding that noose in the hand, he recites the verse यस्तिा रृ्तयुरवर \(PS 1.61.1\) and throws it to the south-west corner of the altar. The PS verse makes it clear 

that the purpose of this act is to release the newborn baby from the fetters

**6** See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 25\). 

**7** See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 129–131\). 

**8** Establishment of brahmapātra is an important act in the preliminaries of rituals. A pot made of bell metal is filled with water and is placed on a grass seat. In the rituals, the pot represents Brahman priest in his absence. 

**9** See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 80–85\).

Shilpa Sumant

of Death. The noose of mauñja grass symbolizes these fetters, and its removal symbolizes the freedom of the baby from Death. This act is unique to the Paippalāda Śākhā. 

9. The next important act in the Jātakarman is the tying of an amulet on the baby. 

The performer takes the wool of a living white sheep and puts one grain of 

rice and one grain of barley in that wool. He wraps the wool with cloth. This 

amulet is first consecrated by putting it in a water jar with the recitation of 

three verses beginning with अवर ्तिा जरररा \(PS 1.61.2–4\), and with the repeti-

tion of the same verses it is taken out of the jar and is then tied on the neck of the newborn baby. 

10. The performer takes water in another pot and puts the grains of rice and barley in it. He consecrates the pot with three verses beginning with प्र विशतर् \(PS 

1.61.3–5\) and puts this consecrated water into the mouth of the baby with his 

right hand. Then the performer recites the verse यसतते सतनः \(PS 20.2.10\) while the mother breastfeeds the baby. 

11. The eyes of the baby are anointed with a paste prepared from rubbing gold 

against stone with the two verses beginning with सहस्ाक्तेण \(PS 1.62.3–4\). 

12. The performer carries out the ritual of Uttaratantra.10 

**I.1.2 Some Observations Regarding the Jātakarman Ritual**

1. In the Jātakarman, all the mantras accompanying the acts are from the PS. 

2. The Jātakarman of the Paippalādins involves some peculiar acts which are 

not seen in other Vedic Śākhās. A common act in this rite according to other 

Vedic Śākhās is making the baby lick the clarified butter or honey with a golden 

spoon. The Kauśikasūtra \(KauśS\) 10.16 prescribes making the baby lick the 

kalka \(pasty sediment\) of śuklapuṣpa, haritapuṣpa, kiṁstyanābhi and pippalī 

rubbed on a piece of gold. Further, KauśS 10.18 mentions making the baby lick 

honey and curds. This practice seems to have been continued in the paddhati s and prayoga s in the Śaunaka tradition.11 In the Paippalādins’ rite, we encounter the practice of making the baby sip the rice and barley water, which seems 

to be unique. Such an act is not described in the KauśS or in later prayoga  texts in the Śaunaka Śākhā. 

**10** The details of the Uttaratantra ritual can be found in chapter 6 named Uttaratantra of the first volume of the KP. See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 113–128\). 

**11** See Rotaru \(2021: 120\) for the details of this rite in the Ātharvaṇīyapaddhati and p. 214–217 of the same work for this rite in the Saṁskāraprayogaratna in the Śaunaka tradition of the AV. 

The Neonatal Rites in the Paippalāda Śākhā 

[[403]]

3. In the Paippalādin rite, we see the practice of tying the amulet. Tying the 

amulets is peculiar in many Ātharvaṇic rites of both Atharvavedic Śākhās. 

However, such practice in not seen in the Jātakarman described by the KauśS 

or in later prayoga s in the Śaunaka Śākhā. 

4. The Medhājanana rite which is a very important part of the Jātakarman ritual 

according to other texts is absent in the Paippalāda Śākhā. 

5. The amplification of the rite with the performance of Vṛddhiśrāddha or 

Nāndīmukhaśrāddha is common to the rituals of both Śākhās of the Athar-

vaveda. 

**I.2  Sūtakāgnihomavidhi \(Offerings on the Sūtaka Fire\) **

**\[Ku 74v3–75r3\]**

The next act in the KP is called the Sūtakāgnihomavidhi. In the opening section of this rite the name of the rite is mentioned as Sūtakāgnau Dvādaśarātrahomavidhi, 

the offerings for twelve nights on the Sūtaka fire. 

**I.2.1 The Procedure of the Sūtakāgnihomavidhi **

1. The performer kindles the fire. The name of this fire at the time of the birth of a child is Sūtaka or Sūtika. He prepares the sthaṇḍila in the lying chamber12 

of mother and child. Everyday he kindles the fire and performs the acts of the 

Pūrvatantra up to the establishment of brahmapātra.13 

2. There are daily offerings of white mustard seeds and small pieces of aśvagandhā \( Physalis Flexuosa\) in the morning and evening with the group of hymns, यते पि्भताः \(PS 7.11\) and the three hymns beginning with यौ तते रातः 

\(PS 16.79–81\). The opening formula before the recitation of the mantras is: 

ॐ बृहसपवतर्ऋविरनुष्ुप्छनदः इनद्ो दतेिता वसतसि्भपाददहोरते विवनयोगः “The seer \[of this group of mantras\] is Bṛhaspati, the metre anuṣṭubh, and the deity Indra. It is employed in the offerings of white mustard seeds etc.”. 

**12** Usually, in old Indian houses there used to be a separate room prepared for the delivery of a baby. After the birth, the mother and the baby were supposed to stay in that room till the period of impurity incurred due to the birth is over. This period is usually of ten days. There are offerings on the Sūtaka fire in this period of impurity and naturally take place in that room where the mother and baby are staying. The word for this room is ariṣṭagṛha, \(a safe or secure room\) in the passage of KP. 

**13** See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 49–80\). 

**404** 

Shilpa Sumant

3. The offerings are continued for up to ten days. For the remaining two days the performer cooks normal rice mixed with sesame powder. 

4. The performer invokes the Sūtaka fire with the verse अग्ते प्रतेवह \(PS 3.38.3\), worships it, and sprinkles it with water three times with the kalpajā 14 verse अवभिष्टिा.15 The kalpajā verses are those which are not found in the Saṁhitā 

but are recited in the tradition. They must have been borrowed from some 

other source \(Kalpa\). The present verses are not available in the known Vedic 

literature but are cited in sakalapāṭha in the Karmasamuccaya.16

5. The sesame-rice is offered into the fire with eight formulas: ॐ नताय सिाहा । 

विनताय सिाहा । खञ्ाय सिाहा । काणाय सिाहा । कुणाय सिाहा । कुटाय सिाहा । वचपटाय 

सिाहा and ॐ रातृभयः सिाहा. The deities in these formulas do not appear in any 

other ritual text in the known literature. 

6. The fire is dismissed with the proper procedure. 

7. On the eleventh day the performer prepares śāntyudaka \(pacificatory water\)17 

on another fire. The mother and the child are made to sip śāntyudaka  and it is also sprinkled on them. Then they are bathed. 

8. The performer recites Śānti. 

9. The Sūtaka fire is taken out of the house to the northeast direction and is disposed of on the main road. 

The Paippalādavivāhādisaṁskārapaddhati \(Paṇḍā 2000\) names this rite of 

Sūtakāgnihomavidhi as Kuṇḍahoma in the opening formula of the offerings 

\(wrongly mentioned as Kuṇḍāhomavidhi in the table of contents as well as in the 

title\). Kuṇḍa  can be a synonym for sthaṇḍila.  18 

**14** For more information about kalpajā  verses in the KP, see Sumant \(2011: 480\). 

**15** The full kalpajā  verse is as follows: अवभिष्टिा पररणयावर । रापयाशङकयावर । रात्ा ्तिग्ते \(ms. KS/Gu1 

्तिाग्ते\) पररणयावर । स रते पद्यनताररृतं ms. KS/Gu1 पद्यन्तिरृतं\) ्तिा अरृततेन पररणयावर । रारतेषिरृतरसयरृतं रवय 

धतेवह । \[Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 63\)\] 

**16** For more details of the Karmasamuccaya and its manuscripts, see Sumant \(2016\). 

**17** Śāntydaka is a technical term in the Atharvavedic literature used for water consecrated with specified mantras. It is often used in the Atharvavedic rituals of both Atharvavedic śākhās. For more information on śāntyudaka, see Rotaru \(2009\) and also Geslani \(2018\). 

**18** Both the words refer to the place for the establishment of the fire. See for instance the entry agnikuṇḍa  in Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary \(2006: 5\). The meaning given here is ‘a pan with live coals; a hole or enclosed space for the consecrated fire’. The meaning given for the word sthaṇḍila  is ‘a piece of open ground \(levelled, squared, and prepared for a sacrifice\)’ \(Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary 2006: 1261\). Both the entries in Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit-English Dictionary are based on the Sanskrit Wörterbuch \(1855–1875: 1.30 and 7.1281\). The Sanskrit-Wörterbuch \(kürzerer Fassung\) \(1883–1886: 3.206\), while giving the meaning of sthaṇḍila, directs us to the commentary on Gobhilagṛhyasūtra 1.5.13 and 4.8.14 \(15 in the edition referred to here\) where in the second place sthaṇḍila  is paraphrased as lohapātra \(iron pot\). Thus, in the

[[405]]

**I.2.2  Some Observations Regarding the Ritual of Sūtakāgnihomavidhi**

1. The fire in which the offerings are made is named as Sūtaka or Sūtika. The 

same names are found in the Bhāradvājagṛhyasūtra 1.26, Pāraskaragṛhyasūtra 

1.16.23, Hiraṇyakeśigṛhyasūtra 2.3.4 etc. and as Jātakāgni in the Baudhāyan-

agṛhyasūtra 4.10.1, Vaikhānasagṛhyasūtra 3.15 etc. 

2. In the Jātakarman ritual of other Vedic Śākhās we see offerings with various 

materials. The Vaikhānasagṛhyasūtra prescribes white mustard seeds with 

small grains of rice. The Āpastambagṛhyasūtra prescribes mustard seeds and 

rice chaff.19 Paippalāda Homa ritual also prescribes white mustard seeds. 

However, the offering of small pieces of Aśvagandhā along with that is unique 

to the Paippalāda Śākhā. Also the preparation of rice with sesame powder is 

not found in other Vedic Śākhās. They prescribe the offering of only caru, rice. 

In the Śaunaka tradition, we do not find any mention of the ten-day or twelve-

day offerings. 

3. The deities to whom the offerings of sesame-rice are made do not appear in any other ritual text in the known literature. 

4. The preparation and use of śāntyudaka is a unique feature of Atharvavedic rites, and the Jātakarman and other neonatal rites are no exception to that. 

**I.3  Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa20 \(Naming ceremony **

**along with the ritual of seeing the sun\) \[Ku 75r3–76v1\]**

The next rite is Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa, the naming ceremony, which also 

includes showing the sun to the child. The KP gives two views as regards the day of performance of Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa. Śrīdhara, the author of the KP, on 

the authority of Nakṣatrakalpa21 says that the rite is performed on the same, that is twelfth day from the birth. He also mentions the usual practice seen in the society of its performance on any auspicious day. It appears here that this usual practice is course of time the leveled and squared ground for establishing the fire, called sthaṇḍila, must have been replaced in the ritual with a square shaped metal vessel called kuṇḍa. 

**19** See Kane \(1941\[1997\]: 232–233\). 

**20** In the opening sentence of the description of this rite, the name of the rite occurs simply as Nāmakaraṇa. I maintain here the titles as given in the concluding sentence of each rite. The concluding sentence in this case is इवत सूय्भदश्भनसवहतं नारकरणं सराप्तर्. Therefore, the name of this rite is taken as Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa. 

**21** The Nakṣatrakalpa known to the Paippalādins appears to be different from that which is available today. For more details on the Nakṣatrakalpa, see Bahulkar \(1984\).

also acceptable to Śrīdhara, as later he gives the guidelines for choosing an auspicious day on the authority of the text named Jyotiḥśāstra. 

**I.3.1 The Procedure of Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa**

The ritualistic acts involved in the Nāmakaraṇa are as follows:

1. The tantra prescribed in the Nakṣatrakalpa is performed up to the ājyabhāga s, that is, up to the two offerings of clarified butter to Agni and Soma.22 

2. The performer offers caru to Viśve devas, Prajāpati, Sarasvatī, the presiding deity of the constellation of that day or the deity of the constellation at the time of the birth of the baby. 

3. He prepares the rice cooked in milk. 

4. He makes to sprinkle śāntyudaka on the child. 

5. He offers the caru to Prajāpati with the recitation of the verses िाचसपतते पृवििी न 

सयोना \(PS 18.16.7–9\). He should offer to Sarasvatī with सरसिवत व्रततेिु \(PS 20.27.10\), to the presiding deity of the constellation of that day or to the deity of the constellation at the time of the birth with अवग्ददेिो यजरानः23. 

6. The performer offers the clarified butter with the verses यिा सूय्भः \(PS 8.6.9\), यो 

नो रद्ाहर् \(PS 19.24.18\), यदाहः शकधूरर् \(PS 19.24.19\) and शं रा िातः \(PS 20.34\). 

7. The performer touches the baby and recites rakṣāmantra s,24 which are रक्नतु 

्तिा \(PS 16.2.1–4\); त्ायराणते \(PS 19.44.7–10\); असपत्नर् \(PS 12.6.5–6\) and अहनते च ्तिा 

\(PS 16.4.10\). 

8. The performer completes the ājyabhāga s of the Uttaratantra and recites Śānti. 

9. The performer looks at the baby with the recitation of the hymn संपशयरानाः \(PS 

1.80\). 

10. The mother covers the baby with her upper garment and goes out of the house. 

11. The performer prepares the sthaṇḍila in the courtyard. He draws an eight–

petaled lotus with chalks.25 He worships the sun on this eight-petaled lotus. He 

**22** The procedure of the Nakṣatrakalpokta tantra is described in the general paradigms of ritual explained by Śrīdhara in the 8th chapter of the KP. See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 133–135\). 

**23** The sakalapāṭha of these kalpajā verses is found at Paippalādavivāhādisaṁskārapaddhati, p. 215 as: अवग्ददेिो यजरानः प्र ण आयूंवि ताररिर् । इदर् ऋक्ं यक्तु ्तिाऽवर र्तया्भ न रृताहविषकृतात् । इदं यिा

**24** These mantras are given at Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 48\). 

**25** The word used in the KP passage is karṇaka, which means a chalk. Perhaps it is used for drawing figures on the ground, similar to the raṅgāvali. The raṅgāvali, or Rangoli in vernacular, is the

shows the sun to the baby while reciting the half verse सुपण्भस्तिाभयिपशयात् \(PS 

1.80.5cd\).26

12. The performer utters the name in the baby’s right ear. This name is as per 

the birth-constellation of the baby. While doing so, the performer attaches 

the word śarman  at the end of that name. There are certain letters that are assigned to the respective constellations and the name begins with one of those 

letters. This is the secret name of the person to be pronounced while saluting 

the teachers and elders.27 The baby’s father utters baby’s public name. 

13. The ceremony ends with Svastivācana \(proclamation of well-being\) and bless-

ings, followed by the Uttaratantra ritual. 

**I.3.2  Some Observations Regarding the Ritual of **

**Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa**

1. Unlike the Paippalāda Śākhā, in other Vedic Śākhās Sūryadarśana is a part of 

Niṣkramaṇa rite. 

2. Śrīdhara cites the view of Nakṣatrakalpa according to which the ritual of 

Nāmakaraṇa is to be performed on the twelfth day. But he also mentions the 

popular practice of fixing some auspicious day for the ritual. 

3. The author cites opinions of several authorities while searching a suitable 

name for the baby along with the extensions such as śarma, varma, gupta and dāsa as per the social strata which the person belongs to. Such rules for naming the child have been prescribed by several Dharmaśāstras.28 

art of drawing decorative figures with white powder at the entrance to the house, and signifies auspiciousness. 

**26** The title of the rite is Sūryadarśana, which means showing the sun or looking at the sun. The mantra 1.80.5cd means that “Let the bird \(that is the sun\) look at you \(that is protect you\)”. Interestingly, the baby looks at the sun, while the mantra means that let the sun look at you \(protect you\). 

We must note here that on the basis of the verb dṛś  in the mantra of sun, the mantra is accompanied in the act of darśana  of the sun. 

**27** On the names of a person including the nakṣatranāman, see Kane \(1941\[1997\]: 240\). Kane \(1941\[1997\]: 247\) says: “The nakṣatranāma was of importance in the performance of Vedic sacrifices. The Vedāṅgajyotiṣa \(of Ṛg.\) in verses 25–28 enumerates 28 nakṣatras \(adding Abhijit after Ut-tarāṣāḍhā and before Śravaṇa\) and their presiding deities and adds that in sacrifices the sacrificer is to bear a name derived from the name of the presiding deity of his nakṣatra.” He further \(p. 248\) cites the rules of Pāṇini for deriving male and female names from the nakṣatra s. 

**28** See Kane \(1941\[1997\]: 243–253\). 

**408**

4. The deities to whom the offerings are made in Nāmakaraṇa in the Paippalāda 

tradition seem to be different from all those mentioned in other Sūtras.29 

5. The KauśS 58.15 prescribes the amulet made of pūtadāru \( Butea Frondosa\). 

This practice is not seen in the ritual texts of the Śaunaka tradition, the Āthar-vaṇīyapaddhati30 or the Saṁskāraprayogaratna.31 It is also absent in the Paip-

palāda tradition. 

**I.4  Māsavarṣavṛddhikarman \(Ritual performed after **

**completion of one month and year after birth\) **

**\[Ku 76v1–77r1\]**

The next rite is Māsavarṣavṛddhikarman. It is to be performed when the baby has 

lived for one month, and is repeated every month on the lunar date of the birth 

\( tithi\) for one year. Thereafter it is performed on the birthday every year. In other Vedic traditions, this rite is called Varṣavardhana or Abdapūrti. In the Śaunaka tradition of the AV, it is called Vardhāpanavidhi. It is noteworthy that in the Paippalāda tradition, the rite is performed for the first time after one month. In other Vedic traditions as the name Abdapūrti suggests, it takes place after one year. The KP 

also describes the minute differences in the procedure when the rite is performed for the first time after one month and when it is repeated every year. This rite has already been discussed in my 2012–2013 article.32 

**I.5  Bahirniṣkramaṇa \(Ritual wherein the baby is taken out **

**of the house for the first time in the fourth month\) **

**\[Ku 77r1–77r3\]**

The next act is Bahirniṣkramaṇa or Niṣkramaṇa, which is performed in the fourth 

month from the birth of a child. It is performed on an auspicious day according to the Jyotiḥśāstra. It is expected that the mother and the child after its birth do not go out of the house till the Niṣkramaṇa rite is performed.

**32** See Sumant \(2012–2013\). The article presents the paragraphs of the description of the rite in the Śaunaka ritual texts and the KP. It also discusses the points of similarity and difference between the procedure in both the traditions. 

The Neonatal Rites in the Paippalāda Śākhā 

[[409]]

**I.5.1  The Acts Involved in Bahirniṣkramaṇa**

1. The baby is taken out of the house for the first time with the recitation of Svastyayanagaṇa. The mantras in this group of hymns are: यसतते प्राचीः \(PS 17.4.1\); 

रा रा पश्ाद् \(PS 17.4.2\); यते तते पनिाः \(PS 17.5.5\); यते तते आरणयाः \(PS 17.5.7\); इराः पारते 

\(19.31.4–7\); असय पारते \(PS 20.42.4\); यदसय पारते \(PS 5.27.8\); प्रपिते पिार् \(PS 20.3.2–6\); इनद्ं ियरनुराधर् \(PS 3.35.2\); रग प्रतेवह \(PS 20.25.7\); अददवतः प्रैतु \(PS 20.25.8\); प्रतेवह प्र हर 

पादौ \(PS 20.50.5–8\); आधिसतपक्णते बृहतते \(PS 20.60.9–20.61.1–3\).33

2. This is followed by the blessings from the Brahmins. 

**I.5.2  Some Observations Regarding the Bahirniṣkramaṇa**

1. The rite is called Nirṇayana in the Śaunaka Śākhā. The KauśS 58.18 prescribes the first stepping out of the child with the ŚS verse 8.2.14. 

2. The rite as described by the Ātharvaṇīyapaddhati and Saṁskāraprayogaratna 

includes looking at the sun. This rite of Sūryadarśana seen in both Atharvave-

dic Śākhās – though on different occasions – is common to the practice seen in 

other Vedic Śākhās. 

3. It is worth mentioning that the rite of the Paippalādins appropriately prescribes the recitation of Svastyayanagaṇa, which is meant for ensuring safety on a journey. 

**I.6  Annaprāśana \(Ritual of first feeding solid food\) **

**\[Ku 77r3–78r2\]**

The Annaprāśana is the last rite described in this group of neonatal rituals of the KP. It takes place in the sixth month from birth. The first ritual feeding of solid food to the baby is performed on an auspicious day declared so by the Jyotiḥśāstra. 

**I.6.1 The procedure of Annaprāśana**

The acts involved are as follows:

1. The performer begins with the tantra prescribed by the Nakṣatrakalpa up to the ājyabhāga s.34 

**33** See Sumant \(2017: 142\). 

**34** See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 133–135\). 

**410** 

Shilpa Sumant

2. The performer cooks rice from the rich variety of rice ripening in the 

autumn. The rice is consecrated with the recitation of the mantras यते वत्िप्ताः 

\(PS 1.6\), रुञ्ावर ्तिा \(1.62\), अहं रद्तेवरः \(ŚS 4.30\), रराग्ते िच्भः \(PS 5.4\), यत्ते अन्नर् \(PS 

1.63.1\), यदन्नरवमि and यसयारन्नर् \(PS 17.4.11\). The performer keeps rice in the 

brass pot. 

3. He arranges gold, book35 and an idol of god as per the custom of the house. 

4. He makes the child sip śāntyudaka \(pacificatory water\) and sprinkles the child with the same. 

5. The performer then makes the child eat that rice with वशिौ तते सतार् \(PS 16.4.8–9\). 

With the recitation of अहनते च ्तिा \(PS 16.4.10\) he gives the second feeding at day time. The third feeding at night with other food items is in the accompaniment 

of शरदते ्तिा \(PS 16.5.2\). These three ritual feedings are mandatory. After these, food is given to the baby as per its requirement. 

6. The rite concludes with the performance of Uttaratantra and the blessings by 

the Brahmins. 

**I.6.2 Some Observations Regarding Annaprāśana**

1. In almost all the Vedic Śākhās including the Paippalāda, this rite is performed during the fourth month from the birth of a child. It is interesting to mention 

that the Ātharvaṇīyapaddhati mentions the time of performance as the eighth 

month.36 

2. The mantras prescribed in the Annaprāśana ritual of the KP are the same as 

mentioned in the KauśS 58.19–21. 

3. The KauśS prescribes rice and barley as the first feeding as the accompanying mantra mentions both rice and barley. The KP, however mentions only rice. 

**I.7 Two Oracles in the Neonatal Rites**

The Jātakarmādyannaprāśanānta section of rituals describes two oracles, where 

the relatives interpret future behaviour of the baby based on its reactions. The first **35** The author of the KP does not clarify which specific book is to be arranged here. Perhaps it is any book as a symbol of knowledge. Gold symbolizes prosperity and book symbolizes knowledge. 

It is wished that the child should obtain both wealth and knowledge in his life. The same wish is articulated in PS 1.6.3. 

**36** See Rotaru \(2021: 132\). 

The Neonatal Rites in the Paippalāda Śākhā 

[[411]]

oracle is in the Jātakarman. The baby’s eyes are anointed with the paste of gold 

rubbed against stone. After this, if the baby looks at its mother and other relatives without blinking eyes then it is believed that the baby is the lustre of the family \(अवञ्तश्तेदवनवरिं रात्ाददकरितेक्तेत् तदासरदीयिंशततेजोऽयवरवत \[Ku 74v2\]\). This means that the baby will prove to be an asset to the family. 

The second oracle is in the Annaprāśana. As per the custom of the house, 

gold, book and image of god etc. are kept near the rice pot from which the child is fed. His future is interpreted as per his choice of lifting the things \(तदननतररोदनसय 

सरीपसिाददवहरणयादीनां बा्लकोग्ते यत् द्व्ं गृह्ावत स तत् राजनवरवत जानीयात् \[Ku 78r1\]\). 

It appears that these are the local customs and therefore have been described 

by the author of the KP. These are not the part of Vedic rite because they are not accompanied with the recitation of any Vedic or kalpajā mantras. 

**Part II  Observations on the Style and Language **

**of the Karmapañjikā**

**II.1 Author’s Tutelary Deity**

It is worth mentioning that each section of the KP begins with the benediction to Lord Nṛsiṁha, the tutelary deity \( iṣṭadevatā\) of the author Śrīdhara.37 The benedic-tory verse of the section Jātakarmādyannaprāśanāntakarmāṇi is as follows:

नृकतेसररं नरसकृ्तय रनोिाक्ावयकैसततः । जातकरा्भददकं िक्यते दयां रवय कुर प्ररो ॥ \[Ku 73v3\]

Having paid homage to the Man-lion with \(the acts performed by\) mind, speech and 

body, I shall narrate the \(procedure of\) Jātakarman etc. O Lord, have compassion 

on me. 

**II.2 The Colophon**

The style of the author in writing the colophon is uniform throughout the text. He calls himself as a servant at the feet of Lord Nṛsiṁha and uses the title Śrīmanma-hopādhyāya. 

**37** For more elaboration on this point, see Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: xlii, item 5.1\). 

**412** 

Shilpa Sumant

The long name of the text Vivāhādikarmapañjikā occurs in each colophon, 

which is sometimes abbreviated as Vivāhakarmapañjikā or Karmapañikā in some 

of the manuscripts. 

The colophon of the section Jātakarmādyannaprāśanāntakarmāṇi is as follows:

इवत श्ीरन्नृससंहचरणपररचारकश्ीरनरहोपाधयायश्ीधरविरवचतायां वििाहाददकर्भपवञ्कायां 

जातकरा्भद्यन्नप्राशनानतं नार कर्भ सराप्तर् । \[Ku 78r 1–2\]

In fact, the colophon has the singular expression jātakarmādyannaprāśanāntaṁ 

karma,  which has been reframed in the plural by Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: xxxiii\), and is retained in this paper. 

**II.2.1 Beginning and Concluding Sentences of Each Section**

The description of each rite begins with the opening sentence such as अि जातकर्भ 

व्ाखयासयारः \[Ku 73v3\], अि सूतकाग्ौ द्ादशरावत्होरविवधरचयतते \[Ku 74v3\], अि नारकरणविवधः 

कथयतते \[Ku 75r3\], अि बा्लकसयायुरि्भिृदधयिथं प्रवतरासं जनरवतिौ आधानकरमोचयतते \[Ku 76v1\], अि वनषक्ररणं व्ाखयासयारः \[Ku 77r1\], and अि िष्ते रासयन्नप्राशनं करमोचयतते \[Ku 77r3\]. 

Besides the final long colophon discussed above there are intermediate short 

concluding sentences after each rite such as इवत जातकर्भ सराप्तर् \[Ku 74v3\], इवत 

सूतकावग्होरविवधः \[Ku 75r3\], इवत सूय्भदश्भनसवहतं नारकरणं सराप्तर् \[Ku 76v1\], रासिि्भिृवधिकर्भ 

सराप्तर् \[Ku 77r1\], and इवत बवहरन्भषक्ररणर् \[Ku 77r3\]. There is a final colophon at the end of the sixth rite Annaprāśana. 

**II.3 The Features of Priestly Sanskrit**

Similar to other sections of the KP, this section also presents features of priestly Sanskrit. 

**II.3.1 Problematic Sentence Construction and Readings **

1. यािद्दशरात्ं सरापय तािभिितीवत \[Ku 74v4–5\]. The intended meaning is that this 

homa takes place and continues for ten days. 

2. ओदनसय सरीपसिाददवहरणयादीनां बा्लकोऽग्ते यत् द्व्ं गृह्ावत स तत् राजनवरवत जानीयात् 

\[Ku 78r1\]. In this case, we have to understand that ओदनसय सरीपसिाददवहरणयादीवन 

बा्लकसय अग्ते कृ्तिा वहरणयादीनां यद् द्व्ं बा्लको गृह्ावत स तत् राजनर्. The things near the rice bowl are kept in front of the child. Among them whichever 

The Neonatal Rites in the Paippalāda Śākhā 

[[413]]

thing he lifts, he is entitled to achieve that in future. The genitive case of 

सरीपसिाददवहरणयादीनां is to be understood as accusative in the first place and 

as genitive in the second place. Also here we have spilt the compound word 

for construal. 

3. ततः कता्भ यसतते सतन इ्तयृचा परि्तिा राता सतनं पाययतेत् \[Ku 74v1\]. Here the agents of two acts connected with the gerund are different. Also the case of ṛc has to be the accusative ṛcam and not the instrumental ṛcā. 

4. The Paribhāṣā verses are not claimed by the author as his own composition. 

These verses are also not free from flaws and grammatical mistakes. There 

is a clumsy construction in the Paribhāṣā verse. न वह प्रतीक्तते यसरावच्छशुः कर्भ 

सतनत्कर् । क्ुधया पीवितोऽ्तयिथं सतनदानतेन िरज्भतर् \[Ku 74r1\]. Here the meaning is quite clear, namely that the baby will not wait until the ritual act including 

Tantra is over. It will be very hungry if deprived of its mother’s breast. Instead of िरज्भतर् there should be िरज्भतः. 

5. In one verse we read पाशरोक्णराददकर् \[Ku 74r2\] instead of the correct 

पाशरोक्णाददकर्. 

6. We have a reading जीििव्तसतरतेिसय \[Ku 74r3\]. The author probably thinks that 

in जीिित् vat  indicates the possessive suffix and the word means ‘possessing life, living’. The reading जीिव्तसतरतेिसय would have been more justifiable as 

jīvat  is the present participle, meaning ‘living’. 

**II.3.2  Violation of Metre**

In a line of a verse we have उदपात्ं प्राशनं कुया्भदवरविञ्तेच्च कतेि्लाददवत \(Ku74v1\]. Here instead of eight syllables, we have nine. 

**II.3.3 Non-Standard Nominal Stem **

1. वपताहसतते \[Ku 73v4\] is used for वपतृहसतते. 

**II.3.4 Grammatically Wrong Cases**

1. ततसततेनोदकतेन स्ाता सूवतकाराचारवत । अभयुक्वत च । ततः स्ानं कृ्तिा । बा्लकं चैतत् \[Ku 75r2–3\]. Here, the correct case for बा्लक should be dative बा्लकाय. ‘And also for the child \(The act is prescribed for the child also\)’. 

2. तदननतरं कता्भ चरविवधना विश्ते दतेिा प्रजापवतः सरसिती तदहन्भक्त्ं जनरनक्त्ं िा इ्तयादद 

क्ीरौदनं श्पवय्तिा \[Ku 75v3\]. In this case, the words विश्ते दतेिाः, प्रजापवतः, सरसिती, 

**414** 

Shilpa Sumant

तदहन्भक्त्ं, and जनरनक्त्ं in the nominative should be in the dative case. He cooks the rice for all gods, Prajāpati, Sarasvatī, the deity presiding over the day and birth–constellation. 

**II.3.5 Wrong Verbal Suffixes**

1. अि कता्भ जातरात्रतेि संपशयराना इवत सूक्ं ब्ुिन् बा्लकरीक्तेत् \[Ku 73v4\]. Here, the root ईक्् takes parasmaipada  suffixes instead of ātmanepada.  Again the same form is found in the Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa \[Ku 76r1–2\]. 

2. अवञ्तश्तेदवनवरिं रात्ाददकरितेक्तेत् तदासरदीयिंशततेजोऽयवरवत \[Ku 74v\]. In this case also the same root ईक्् is again used with the ātmanepada  suffix. 

**II.3.6 Double Sandhi **

1. ततोदपात्ादुदधृ्तय \[Ku 74r\] is found instead of तत उदपात्ादुदधृ्तय. 

**II.4 The pratīka****s Used in the Section Under Discussion**

As with all the ritual texts in all the Vedic traditions, the KP also mentions the mantras from its own Śākhā with their pratīka, that is the incipits of the mantras. 

The KP also mentions the kalpajā  verses with the pratīka.  Below are a few cases where the author of the KP uses strange pratīka s. 

1. In the Sūtakāgnihomavidhi, we come across the pratīka  of the mantra PS 16.79–

81 as यौ तते रात इवत \[Ku 74v4\]. The correct pratīka would have been यौ तते राततेवत. 

2. Another pratīka in the Sūtakāgnihomavidhi is यते पि्भततेवत for the hymn यते पि्भताः 

\(PS 7.11\). Here we see double sandhi.  38 

3. In the Nāmakaraṇa, we see the pratīka  यदाहः शकधूराहवर्तयृचा \[Ku 75v5\] for PS 

19.24.19 which is यदाहः शकधूरं रहानक्त्ाणार्. 

4. While showing the the sun to the baby the half verse सुपण्भस्तिाभयिपशयात् \(PS 

1.80.5cd\) is recited. The pratīka  for this in the KP is सुपण्भस्तिाभयिपशया इ्तयध्भचदेन 

\[Ku 76r3\]. The last consonant t is missing. 

5. In the Annaprāśana, there is a pratīka  यदन्नरवमि \[Ku 77v3\]. Usually, if the mantra is from the PS, the author of the KP does not give any indication. But if the 

**38** The proper prattīka  would be पि्भता इवत. Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: c\) report similar case of the pratīka  वहरणयिणदेवत, which should be वहरणयिणा्भ इवत. 

The Neonatal Rites in the Paippalāda Śākhā 

[[415]]

mantra is from another source, he gives the indication as kalpajā ṛc.  In the present case there is no indication. If we search for the verse in the PS there 

are three mantras beginning with these words, PS 2.28.2, 2.28.3 and 20.15.1. 

However, the ritual text of Karmasamuccaya gives the sakalapāṭha  of this mantra as यदन्नरवमि बहधा विरूपं रद्ैः प्रदगधं यदद िा वपशाचैः । सिथं तदीशानोऽरयं कृणोतु 

वशिं र ईशानाय सिाहा.39 This means that in the ritual, a different kalpajā verse is used, which is probably modeled after the PS verses. The author of the KP does 

not give his usual indication of identifying the verse as kalpajā. 

**II.5 Citations from Other Texts**

1. Most of the accompanying mantras in the rites explained above are from the 

PS. There are only a few instances where the mantras used are kalpajā verses. 

The full kalpajā verses can be found in the Karmasamuccaya manuscripts and the published book Paippalādavivāhādisaṃskārapaddhati \(Paṇḍā 2000\) based 

on Karmasamuccaya manuscripts. 

2. There are citations from unidentified texts such as Paribhāṣā and Jyotiḥśāstra. 

3. In the Nāmakaraṇa, there are some verses in continuation with Jyotiḥśāstra 

verses. The author of the KP does not ascribe these verses to any text. नारधतेयं 

दशमयां तु द्ादशयां िासय कारयतेत् । पुणयते वतिौ रुहूतदे िा नक्त्ते िा गुणावनित इवत . This half verse is Manusmṛti 2.30. It says that Naming ceremony should take place on the 

tenth day of the birth or on an auspicious day, time and constellation. The verse शर्भिदब्ाह्मणसय सयाद्ाज्ो रक्ासरवनितर् । िैशयसय पुवष्संयुक्ं शूद्सय प्रतेषयसंयुतर् is found in Manusmṛti 2.32. शरदेवत ब्ाह्मणसयोक्ं िरदेवत क्वत्यसय च । गुप्तदासा्तरकं नार प्रशसतं 

िैशयशूद्योररवत is found in Viṣṇupurāṇa 3.10.9. In the Nāmakaraṇa section of KP, 

there are three verses ascribed to Arthaśāstra which can be found with some 

variation at Viṣṇupurāṇa 3.10.10–11 and Manusmṛti 2.33 respectively. These 

are नाि्भहीनं न चाशसतं नापशबदयुतं तिा । नारङगलयं नायुगरं िा नार कुया्भ्तसराक्रर् ॥ 

नावतदीर्थं नावतह्रसिं नावतगुि्भक्रावनितर् । सुखोच्चायथं तु तन्नार कुया्भन्नप्रणिाक्रर् \(Viṣṇupurāṇa 3.10.10.11\) and स्तीणां सुखोद्यरक्रूरं विसपष्ािथं रनोररर् । रङगलयदीर््भिणमोत्रा

शीिा्भदावरधानित् \(Manusmṛti 2.33\). They also provide the characteristics of the 

name that should be given to the baby. Śrīdhara makes use of various sources 

but is sloppy in citing their accurate name. 

4. In the Annaprāśana section, the verse आयुषयं प्राङरुखो रुङक्ते etc. is Mahābhārata 13.70.25 with variation in pāda  c, while verbatim with Kūrmapurāṇa 2.19.2 

**39** See Paippalādavivāhādisaṁskārapaddhati, p. 221. 

**416** 

Shilpa Sumant

and Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa 2.86.7. But Śrīdhara does not cite the name of 

the source text. 

**II.6 Cross References**

This section of Jātakarmādyannaprāśanāntakarmāṇi in the KP has many cross ref-

erences. It is natural that it presupposes the earlier sections of KP dealing with preliminary rituals. These earlier sections are Pūrvatantra and Uttaratantra, that is the basic ritual performed in all the Jātasaṁthās. The rites of Sthaṇḍilavidhāna and Nakṣatrakalpoktatantra, dealt with in chapters seven and eight of the KP respec-tively40 are specific to these neonatal rituals. 

**Part III  The Text and Translation41 of the Chapter **

**on Jātakarmādyannaprāśanāntakarmāṇi **

\[Ku 73v3\]

नृकतेसररं नरसकृ्तय रनोिाक्ावयकैसततः ।

Having paid homage to the Man-lion with \(the acts performed by\) mind, speech and 

body, I shall narrate the \(procedure of\) Jātakarman etc. O Lord, have compassion 

on me. 

अि जातकर्भ व्ाखयासयारः । 

Now we will explain the \(ritual of\) Jātakarman. 

अि कता्भ जातरात्रतेि संपशयराना इवत सूक्ं ब्ुिन् बा्लकरीक्तेत् । तदननतरं िृवधिश्ाधिं

As soon as the child is born, the performer looks at the baby with the recita-

tion of the hymn संपशयरानाः \(PS 1.80\). After that, he makes the father of the baby **40** See Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: 129–131 and 133–136\).

perform the Vṛddhiśrāddha himself.42 The father should give \(to the performing 

priest gifts such as\) land, a cow, gold etc. according to his ability. Then the performer makes \(the father\) recite Svasti \(auspicious verses\). \(The father of the baby, who is yajamāna in this ritual\) appoints the performer \(for the ritual act\). The performer establishes the fire on the sthaṇḍila.  He establishes brahman.43

सिवणि्लतेनैि कत्भव्ा होरा द्ादशरावत्काः ॥ 

इवत सिवणि्लरात्ं रितीवत । 

In this ritual, how does one establish the sthaṇḍila by skipping \(the acts in the Pūrvatantra\) up to the offerings of clarified butter? \(In this regard, the author\) says in the Paribhāṣā text \(as under:\)

In the case of the ritual for the newborn, one should not perform the basic 

format of the ritual \( tantra\), even though \(the ritual for the newborn\) comes under the jātasaṁsthā s. 

Because the baby will be very hungry if kept deprived of the breast, and cannot 

wait until the completion of the \(lengthy\) ritual along with the tantra. 

Because the breast \(of the mother\) is given \(soon\) after amulet of rice and 

barley is tied and water \(prepared with\) rice and barley is given; for this reason, one should not perform the tantra. 

After kindling the fire on the sthaṇḍila, one should perform all the acts such as loosening the noose etc., anointing the eyes etc. \(in the Jātakarman ritual\). 

All the acts beginning from the tying of the amulet are to be performed as pre-

scribed. The oblations for twelve nights are to be performed with the sthaṇḍila \(fire itself\). 

Therefore, only \(the act of establishing\) the sthaṇḍila  takes place. 

**42** One may witness here Śrīdhara’s priestly Sanskrit style of using gerunds instead of finite verbal forms. Such sentences have been translated into English using finite verbal forms.

Holding that noose, he recites the verse यस्तिा रृ्तयुरवर \(PS 1.61.1\) \(and\) throws that noose to the south-west corner of the altar.

Then the hotṛ 47 puts one grain of rice and one grain of barley in the wool of a living white sheep, wraps a cloth around the wool with a thread \(and\) puts \(it\) in a water jar and consecrates it with the recitation of three verses beginning with अवर ्तिा 

जरररा \(PS 1.61.2–4\). Taking \(it\) out from the water jar, he consecrates \(it\) with the \(repetition of\) the same verses. With the recitation of the mantra, he ties \(it\) on the neck of the newborn baby, who has been given a bath. The performer performs the pacificatory rite of the amulet. After that, he prepares the udapātra \(water jar\) with another pot by putting the grains of rice and barley in it. He consecrates it with three verses beginning with प्र विशतर् \(PS 1.61.3–5\). He takes a little water from the udapātra \(jar\) in his right hand and with the same mantra pours it into the mouth of the baby. 

तिा च परररािायार्। \[Ku 74v\]

सहोदपात्ं धानयादद वरश्ं शुधिं तु कतेि्लर् । 

उदपात्ं प्राशनं कुया्भदवरविञ्तेच्च कतेि्लाददवत ॥

And thus \(is stated\) in the Paribhāṣā \(text\): 

The water jar along with grains etc. is \(called\) miśra  and when it is pure \(water, it is called\) kevala.  One should drink \(the water\) from the udapātra  and one should sprinkle \(the pure water\) from the kevala. 

**45** यिरतेकं \] em., यिैकं NiKuGu1Gu2Gu3. 

**46** Here the original reading ततो as against the emended one ततः is retained honouring the priestly style of Śrīdhara’s composition. Just see the phrase ततो रणतेः in the previous sentence influencing this reading. 

**47** We come across two different priests, hotṛ  and kartṛ.  It is difficult to differentiate between them. 

I think probably the hotṛ  is the main priest, who recites the mantras and the kartṛ  is the performer of the acts. In the present-day ritual of the Paippalādins also we see two priests pustakācārya  and kartṛ.  The pustakācārya is the main priest, who recites mantras and supervises the whole proceedings. In the translation, I have kept the word as it is and have translated kartṛ  as performer, similar to all rituals. Later in the Māsavarṣavṛddhi ritual also, we come across two priests hotṛ  and kartṛ.

इवत जातकर्भ सराप्तर् ।

Then the performer recites the verse यसतते सतनः \(PS 20.2.10\), while the mother 

should breastfeed the baby. Then, pouring clarified butter on a stone, he rubs gold against it. He should anoint the eyes of the baby with that paste with the recitation of the two verses beginning with सहस्ाक्तेण \(PS 1.62.3–4\). If the anointed baby looks at its mother etc. without blinking, then one should understand that the baby is the lustre of our family as per the Vedic statement.49

The performer carries out the ritual of Uttaratantra beginning with यते दतेिाः etc. 

Here ends the ritual of Jātakarman. 

अि सूतकाग्ौ द्ादशरावत्होरविवधरचयतते । तत्ादौ अररष्गृहानतकते सिण् वि्लरुपव्लपय । तवसरन्

Now, the ritual of offering for twelve nights on the Sūtaka fire is being 

described. First of all, he prepares the sthaṇḍila inside the ariṣṭagṛha \(secure room or the lying-in-chamber of the mother and child\). Everyday in the morning and 

evening, he kindles the fire \(called\) Sūtika on it by following the ritual of sthaṇḍila. 

He \(performs the Purvatantra up to the\) placement of brahman.  

ॐ बृहसपवतर्ऋविरनुष्ुप्छनदः इनद्ो दतेिता वसतसि्भपाददहोरते विवनयोग इवत धया्तिा । यते पि्भततेवत

He meditates \(on the seer, deity and metre as described in the following 

manner:\) The seer \(of this group of mantras\) is Bṛhaspati, the metre anuṣṭubh, and the deity Indra; the employment is in the offering of white mustard seeds etc. 

\(This group of mantras contains\) the hymn52 यते पि्भताः \(PS 7.11\), the three hymns beginning with यौ तते रातः \(PS 16.79–81\). With these mantras, he should offer white mustard seeds and small pieces of aśvagandhā \( Physalis Flexuosa\) by mixing them together. In this manner, a daily morning and evening offering takes place, until the completion of ten nights. 

**48** अवञ्तश्तेदवनवरिं \] Gu1Gu3, lac. Ni, असयवञ्तश्तेदवनवरिं Ku, सहवञ्तश्तेदवनवरिं Gu2. 

**49** The source of this unfamiliar Vedic statement could not be traced. 

**50** Here we see double sandhi.  The reading here should be पि्भता इवत. Griffiths and Sumant \(2018: c\) report similar case of the pratīka  वहरणयिणदेवत, which should be वहरणयिणा्भ इवत. 

**51** यािद्दशरात्ं \] Gu2, यािद्दादशरात्ं NiKuGu1Gu3 . 

**52** The word kaṇḍikā  means a section. The author of the KP consistently uses this word in the sense of hymn throughout his text.

इवत सूतकावग्होरविवधः ।

Then after ten nights, for the remaining \(period of\) two days, the performer 

cooks the usual rice mixed with sesame powder. He kindles the Sūtaka fire. He 

invokes the Sūtaka fire with the verse अग्ते प्रतेवह \(PS 3.38.3\). After worshiping the Sūtaka fire in the prescribed manner, he sprinkles around it with water three 

times with \(the kalpajā verse\) अवभिष्टिा. He offers the sesame-rice with the eight formulas beginning with नताय etc. \(The formulas are:\) ॐ नताय सिाहा. विनताय सिाहा. 

खञ्ाय सिाहा. काणाय सिाहा. कुणाय सिाहा. कुटाय सिाहा. वचपटाय सिाहा and ॐ रातृभयः 

सिाहा. Then the performer dismisses that fire. Some people wish to perform in this manner after ten days on the twelfth night.54

Here ends the ritual of Sūtakāgnihoma \(offering on the Sūtaka fire\). 

ततः एकादशतेऽवहन कता्भ सिवणि्लते अनयवसरन्नग्ौ शान्तयुदकं करोवत । ततसततेनोदकतेन स्ातां55

इवत जातकर्भवण शान्तयुदकविवधः ।

Then on the eleventh day, the performer prepares śāntyudaka \(pacificatory water\) on sthaṇḍila on another fire on the sthaṇḍila.56 He makes the woman who has delivered \(a baby\), who has taken a bath, sip that water and sprinkles \(her with it\). Then the same \(procedure is followed\) for the baby who is given a bath. Then the performer recites Śānti \(mantras\). Thereafter, taking the Sūtaka fire out of the house to the northeast direction he should dispose of it on the main road. 

Here ends the procedure of \(preparation of\) śāntyudaka, \(which is a component\) in the Jātakarman. 

अि नारकरणविवधः कथयतते । 

Now, the ritual of naming ceremony is described. 

**53** सूतकावग्ः \] corr. सूतकाग्ौ NiKuGu1Gu3, सूतकावग् Gu2. 

**54** This means that some people wish to perform longer than ten nights, up to the twelfth night. 

**55** स्ातां \] corr. स्ाता NiKuGu1Gu2Gu3. 

**56** The fire named Sūtaka, which was used for offerings for up to tend days, is dismissed. The Sūtaka fire is not to be used for the preparation of pacificatory water. Therefore, another fire with another name, probably Pragalbha \(see Griffiths and Sumant 2018: 60 for different names of Agni\) is invoked on the sthaṇḍila.

According to the ritual described in the Nakṣatrakalpa, one should perform 

the Naming ceremony on the very same day \(that is on twelfth day from the birth, 

on which the ritual offering for twelve days is concluded\). Thus, it is stated in the Nakṣatrakalpa. People, however, perform the naming ceremony on an auspicious

One should give the name to this \(baby\) on the tenth or twelfth day or on an auspicious lunar day \( tithi\) or during an auspicious time span of the day \( muhūrta \) or an auspicious constellation possessing specific characteristics. 

The name of a Brahmin is joined with \(a word\) śarman \(denoting happiness\). 

The name of a Kṣatriya is connected with \(a word denoting\) rakṣā \(protection\). The name of a Vaiśya is connected with \(a word denoting\) prosperity and the name of a Śūdra is joined with \(a word denoting\) command. 

And also \(this is stated in the text\):

It is said \(in case\) of \(the name of a\) Brahmin \(that it should be connected with\) śarman.  It is said \(in case\) of \(the name of a\) Kṣatriya \(that it should be connected with\) varman. The name of a Vaiśya and of a Śūdra is praiseworthy, when has gupta and dāsa \(connected to these names respectively\).

Its procedure is being described. One should perform the tantra  in one’s house as prescribed in the Nakṣatrakalpa up to the ājyabhāga s. Thereafter, the performer, in the manner of offering caru, cooks the rice \(mixed\) with milk for Viśve devas, Prajāpati, Sarasvatī, \(the presiding deity of\) the constellation of that day or \(the deity of\) the constellation at the time of the birth of the baby. He makes the child sip śāntyudaka and sprinkles \(the child with\) it. Thereafter, touching the baby \(the performer\) after putting the big logs \(on the fire\) should offer the caru  to the \(above-\) mentioned deities with the procedure of caturavattadharma \(by dividing the caru into four parts\). With the three verses िाचसपतते पृवििी न सयोना \(PS 18.16.7–9\), he should offer the milk-rice to Prajāpati \(three times\) with each verse. At each offering offering is with प्रजापतयते न रते \(this is for Prajāpati and not for me\). He should offer \(the same\) to Sarasvatī with सरसिवत व्रततेिु \(PS 20.27.10\), to \(the presiding deity of\) the constellation of that day or to \(the deity of\) the constellation at the time of the birth with अवग्ददेिो यजरानः etc. He offers the clarified butter with the verses यिा 

सूय्भः \(PS 8.6.9\), यो नो रद्ाहर् \(PS 19.24.18\), यदाहः शकधूरर् \(PS 19.24.19\) and शं रा िातः

Then the performer performs \(the acts\) beginning with यते दतेिाः ending with the

इ्तयध्भचदेन बा्लकरादद्तयं दश्भयतेत् ।

Then the performer should look at the baby with the recitation of the hymn 

संपशयरानाः \(PS 1.80\). And the mother covers \(the baby\) with \(her\) upper garment. 

He makes \(the mother with the baby\) move out of the house as per the custom of 

the family. Then the performer prepares the sthaṇḍila in the courtyard. He draws an eight-petaled lotus with chalk. He worships the sun on the pericarp of the lotus \(diagram\). Thereafter, he shows the sun to the baby while reciting the half verse सुपण्भस्तिाभयिपशयात् \(PS 1.80.5cd\).

He declares the characteristics of the name as is stated in the \(text named\) 

Arthaśāstra:

The name should not be meaningless, not disapproved, not a vulgar word. It 

should not be inauspicious, not with the odd syllables. One should make is having even syllables \(in it\). 

It should not be too long or too short. It should not contain many heavy syl-

lables. The name that is easy to pronounce and does not contain the syllable oṁ 

should be given. 

The name of a girl child should be easy to pronounce, not harsh, it should have 

a clear meaning and be beautiful. It should contain auspicious \(meaning\), should 

have long syllables, and containing good blessings.

In this manner, one should give the name of a boy. The name of a girl child 

should not be \(a name of\) a tree, river, constellation, hill, mountain etc. It should not be harsh, it should be very soft, it should be like an adornment and with even syllables.

Then the performer performs Svastivācana \(proclamation of well-being\). He 

makes \(the elders\) give blessings. The performer performs the Uttaratantra ritual. 

Here ends the \(ritual of\) Sūryadarśanasahitanāmakaraṇa \(Naming ceremony 

along with showing the sun\).

इवत चरहोरं सरापय ।

Now is described the act of establishing \(the fire for offering\)63 every month 

on a child’s birth- tithi \(the lunar day corresponding to the birth\) for the long life of the child. Then, the performer, performs the tantra prescribed by the Nakṣatrakalpa up to the ājyabhāga s \(butter oblations to Agni and Soma at the end of the principal offerings\) as \(is described\) earlier. He cooks \(rice with milk\) in the manner of cooking caru, for Agni, Candra and Prajāpati as earlier. Then the performer offers the caru to Agni with the practice of caturavatta \(dividing the caru in four parts for four oblations\) with the verse ्तिरग्ते प्ररवतः \(PS 1.54.1\). 

Each offering is made by assigning the name of the deity, as before. \(He makes an offering\) to Candra \(with the verse\) निो निो रिवत \(PS 18.3.3\). He makes an offering, to Prajāpati, only mentally with the verse प्रजापतते न वह ्तिदनयः \(PS 20.32.10\). 

The rest \(of the procedure is\) as \(prescribed\) earlier \(which includes an offering to Anumati, immediately following an offering to Prajāpati\). In this manner he 

completes the caruhoma.  

ततो होता रुञ्ावर ्तितेवत कवणिका । आयुदा्भ दतेितेवत चतस्ः । एतैराजयं ह्तिा । ततः कता्भ यते दतेिादद

Then, the hotṛ \(recites\) the hymn \( kaṇḍikā\) रुञ्चारव त्िा \(PS 1.62\) and the four verses \(beginning with\) आयुर्दा दतेि \(PS 15.5.1–4\). \(The performer\) offers clarified butter with these \(verses\). Then the performer performs \(the acts\) beginning with यते दतेिाः up to the sviṣṭakṛt  offerings \(in the Uttaratantra\). Then he recites Śānti \(verses\). In this manner he performs \(the ritual\) every month until one year is 

complete. 

**63** This act seems to be the establishing of the sthaṇḍila.

Hereafter is described the ritual \(to be performed\) every year on the birthday 

\(of the child according to the lunar calendar\). But there is a distinction \(in the procedure performed every month until one year, and which is performed on the birth-

day\) every year. It is as follows: \(He takes\) a garment consecrated with the remnants of offerings \(with the recitation of\) the hymn रनायै तनतुर् \(PS 2.87\), \(and\) he should make a knot \(in it\) with the verse धाता तते ग्वनिर्. Then the performer should make the child sip water \(from\) the water-pot \(consecrated\) with the hymn तुभयरतेि जरररन् 

\(PS 1.12\). He should feed \(the child\) the milk-rice, the remainder of the offering. 

Thereafter, the hotṛ should \(recite\) the hymn दूषया दूविरवस \(PS 1.57\) \(and the performer should\) tie the pratisara amulet consecrated with \(the mantras in the hymn\). 

Then the performer should complete the rest \(of the procedure of the Uttaratantra\). 

Thus ends the rite of Māsavarṣavṛddhi.70

Now, we will explain the ritual of the first taking out \(of the the baby\) \(Niṣkramaṇa\). 

One should perform the ritual wherein the baby is taken out of the house for 

the first time in the fourth month \(from the birth\). The Niṣkramaṇa \(ritual\) is to be conducted on an auspicious day prescribed by the \(Jyotiḥ\)śāstra.

It is said in the Jyotiḥśāstra \(text\):

On \(the constellations of\) Svātī, Aśvinī,71 Tiṣya, Karaṇa, Mūla, Punarvasu, 

Pauṣṭa \(Puṣya\), Anurādhā, Hari \(that is probably Maghā, which falls in the Siṁha 

zodiacal sign\), Paṅkaja \(probably Abhijit, whose symbol is the lotus\), Vāsava 

\(Dhaniṣṭhā\); on Fridays, Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays, taking the babies out 

of the house for the first time is auspicious. 

Avoiding the constellations of Ārdrā and the constellations \(termed as\) 

adhomukha \(such as Āśleṣā etc.\), on the unimpaired \(i.e. auspicious\) constellations, on the days avoiding riktā tithi s \(which are the fourth, ninth, or fourteenth day of the lunar fortnight\), \(if Niṣkramaṇa is performed\) on Tuesdays and Saturdays, 

\(then only\) when the zodiac signs of Kuṁbha, Tūlā, Kanyā and Siṁha have arisen, 

when aspected by auspicious \(planets\),72 in the fourth month or in the third month when the Moon \(of the child\) is strong and auspicious, \(on that day\) the very first taking out of the child from the house is to be performed. 

ततः कता्भ सिस्तययनगणतेन यिाकु्लरया्भदानुसारतेण वशशोरन्भषक्ररणं कारवय्तिा । ब्ाह्मणैराशीिा्भदं 

कारयतेत् । 

Then the performer, while reciting the Svastyayanagaṇa, should conduct the 

first taking out of the child from the house as per the customs of the family. He should make the Brahmins give blessings \(to the child\). 

इवत बवहरन्भषक्ररणर् ।

Here ends the ritual of Bahirniṣkramaṇa. 

अि िष्ते रासयन्नप्राशनं करमोचयतते । 

Then, the ritual of the \(first\) feeding \(Annaprāśana\) is being described, \(which 

is to be performed\) in the sixth month \(from the birth\). 

यदुक्ं जयोवतःशास्तते । 

िष्ते रावस शुरते चनद्ते पक्ते चापयवसततेतरते । 

अन्नसय प्राशनं कुया्भददतो य्तप्रिरं वशशोः ॥ 

**71** This constellation is taken as Aśvinī in the translation, though the text has Aśvi. 

**72**  Saddṛṣṭa is translated as “when aspected by auspicious \(planets\)”. The plantes are classified as auspicious or inauspicious. Dṛṣṭi \(aspect of a planet\) is a specific characteristic assigned to planets in Astrology. The auspicious and inauspicious planets occupy a particular position \(called a ‘house’\) in the horoscope of a person depending on the birth time of that person. They completely influence the seventh house \(and in the case of some planets even the other houses\) from the occupied house. 

The aspects have good or bad effects on the life of a person.

As is said in the \(text called\) Jyotiḥśāstra:

One should perform the ritual of the first feeding of the child in the sixth 

month, in the bright fortnight, when the moon \(as per the horoscope of the child\) is auspicious. 

The \(first ritual\) feeding of the child is favorable during the constellations 

of Hasta,74 Puṣya, Punarvasu, Kamalaja, \(probably Abhijit, whose symbol is the 

lotus\), Tvāṣṭra \(Citrā, whose deity is Tvaṣṭṛ\), Mṛgaśīrṣa \(whose deity is Indu, the Moon\), Viśākhā \(whose deity is Indra\), Aśvinī, Svāti \(whose deity is Vāyu\), Uttara,75 

Dhaniṣṭhā \(whose deity is Vasus\), Kṛttikā \(whose deity is Agni\), Maghā and Pauṣṭa \(Revatī \(whose deity is Puṣan\); not on the empty tithi \(the fourth, ninth, or fourteenth day of the lunar fortnight\); on Wednesdays, Fridays, Mondays, Sundays and 

Thursdays; and when the zodiac signs of Kanyā and Mithuna . . .76. 

अनयच्च ।

And also:

\(If the ritual of the first feeding is performed\) on Sunday, the man becomes of 

good appetite, on Monday of contented appetite, on Tuesday afflicted by diseases, on Wednesday of strong constitution, on Thursday the one with many enjoyments 

and pleasures, on Friday enjoined with victory \(and\) the one who has eaten \(on 

Saturday\) dead. 

**73** ्तिाष्टैo \] em. ्तिाष्ैo NiKuGu1Gu2Gu3. 

**74** The word Hasta is lengthened in the verse, perhaps metri causa. 

**75** I am not sure whether by Uttara, the text means Uttara Phālgunī, Uttara Āṣāḍhā or Uttara Bhādrapadā. 

**76** I am not sure what this oसोरानोदयते means and I therefore refrain from translating this word. 

Probably by Soma the text means the zodiac Karka, presided over by the deity Moon. Also the reading of the verse following this one is obscure, and is hence left untranslated here.

Shilpa Sumant

\(While feeding, the child\) facing the east enjoys a long life. The one facing the south enjoys \(what is\) glorious. The one facing the west enjoys wealth. The one 

facing the north enjoys \(the fruit of\) righteousness.77 

On the five parvan days \(the days on which moon changes its course, namely the full moon, the eighth and fourteenth days of both the fortnights\), on the seventh and eleventh day of the dark fortnight, the ritual feeding of children harms life, knowledge, fame and strength.

On an auspicious day, the performer performs the tantra prescribed by the Nakṣatrakalpa up to the ājyabhāga s. He cooks rice \(intended for\) sthālīpāka. The rice should be cooked with the \(rich variety of rice called\) mahāvrīhi. By the word mahāvrīhi, one should understand the long grain ripening in autumn. Or \(one should use\) the grains of barley. He consecrates rice with the recitation of the 

mantras यते वत्िप्ताः \(PS 1.6\), रुञ्ावर ्तिा \(1.62\), the eight verses beginning with अहं 

रद्तेवरः \(ŚS 4.30.1\), रराग्ते िच्भः \(PS 5.4\), यत्ते अन्नर् \(PS 1.63.1\), यदन्नरवमि 79 and यसयारन्नर् 

\(PS 17.4.11\). Then the performer puts rice in a pot made of brass etc. He arranges near it \(the rice pot\) a piece of gold, a book and an idol \(of god\) as per the custom of the family. Then the performer makes the child sip śāntyudaka \(pacificatory water\) and sprinkles \(the child\) with the same. Then he makes the child eat that rice for the first time with the two verses beginning with वशिौ तते सतार् \(PS 16.4.8–9\). With the recitation of अहनते च ्तिा \(PS 16.4.10\) he gives the second feeding of other food \(items\) during the day and at nighttime. Some \(recommend that he should\) give the foremost \(?\) food day and night. The third feeding is in the accompaniment of the verse शरदते ्तिा . . . \(PS 16.5.2\) \(to be modified\) according to the seasons.80 Then he **77** The translation of this sentence is based on the meaning of the word ṛtabhj, ‘enjoying \(the fruit of\) one’s righteousness or pious works’ given in Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary \(2006: 223\).

**79** For the complete mantra see item 4, point 4 above. 

**80** The mantra mentions four seasons Śarad, Vasanta, Hemanta and Grīṣma. The mantra is to be modified according to the season, in which the ritual is being performed as शरदते ्तिा पररदमिवस,

feeds the baby at ease. Thereafter, \(he keeps\) the things near the rice bowl in front of the child. Among them whichever thing \(the child\) lifts, he is entitled to achieve that \(in the future\). Then the performer performs Uttaratantra. He makes the Brahmins give blessings.
