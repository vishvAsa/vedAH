The *R̥gveda-Saṁhitā* \(henceforth Rigveda\) has attracted a fairly steady stream of philological and linguistic scholarship ever since the pioneering modern editions of Friedrich Max Müller \(1849–1874\) and Theodor Aufrecht \(1861–1863; 1877\). In 

recent decades, thanks to the publication of the metrically restored version of the text by van Nooten and Holland \(1994\), sophisticated translations by Elizarenkova \(1989–1999\), Witzel and Gotō \(2007\), Witzel, Gotō and Scarlata \(2013\), Jamison and Brereton \(2014\), and Dōyama and Gotō \(2022\), alongside far-reaching studies such 

as those by Oberlies \(1998; 1999\) and the online commentary by Jamison \(http://

rigvedacommentary.alc.ucla.edu\), this stream has become a relative torrent. By contrast, work on the two extant Saṁhitās of the Atharvaveda, namely the *Śaunaka-Saṁhitā *\(ŚS\) and the *Paippalāda-Saṁhitā* \(PS\), long considered second in antiquity only to the Rigveda, has been decidedly more sporadic since Roth and Whit-

ney’s critical edition of the ŚS was published in 1856. Certainly this can, to some extent, be explained by the fact that until the 1950s the PS was known to outsiders only via a single, extremely corrupt birch-bark manuscript \(discovered in Srinagar, in Kashmir, in 1873\), published in facsimile by Bloomfield and Garbe \(1901\) and 

now available online at https://opendigi.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/opendigi/MaI421\_1. 

However, since the partial translation of the ŚS by Bloomfield \(1897\), covering 

about one third of the text, the near-complete translation by Whitney, with revi-

sions and additions by Lanman \(Whitney and Lanman 1905\), and the revision of 

Roth and Whitney’s *editio princeps* by Lindenau \(1924\), little substantial work has been carried out on this Saṁhitā either until the last few years, which have seen several important studies by Shrikant Bahulkar, as well as a new critical edition by Kim \(2021\). 

For its part, the *Paippalāda-Saṁhitā* occupies a unique place in Vedic literature in that it only became accessible to genuine scholarly research from the late 1950s, with the discovery of several palm-leaf manuscripts in rural Odisha by Durgamohan Bhattacharyya \(1899–1965\), Professor of Sanskrit at Scottish Church College in Kolkata. These manuscripts preserve a much better version of the PS text than does the Kashmir manuscript, and their discovery constituted a significant enlargement of the Vedic textual corpus and a major advance in scholarly research into Vedic 

language and culture. Since this “Announcement of a Rare Find” by Bhattacharyya 

\(1957\), a text of the complete PS has been edited by his son, Dipak Bhattacharya 

\(Bhattacharya 1997, 2008, 2011, 2016\). Moreover, further Odishan PS manuscripts 

have come to light courtesy of the Odisha State Museum in Bhubaneswar, and the 

pioneering fieldwork of Michael Witzel in 1983 and Arlo Griffiths between 1998–

2001 \(on which, see Griffiths 2003\). On this basis, the prodigious task of understanding and evaluating the PS is now being embarked upon, and pioneering editions 

and translations of individual books \( *kāṇḍa*-\) have been published \(e.g. Zehnder 1999, Lubotsky 2002, the landmark work of Griffiths 2009, the online publications 

of our own team in Zurich https://www.atharvaveda-online.uzh.ch/edition; for the 

current status of the PS in translation, see https://www.atharvaveda-online.uzh.ch/

home/paippalada-research\). It is already five years since Selva’s \(2019\) “state of the art” overview of scholarship on the PS to date, and since that time, five more PS 

Kāṇḍas have been critically edited and translated \(four of these by our own project team in Zurich, the other by Spiers 2020\). 

This very cursory and inadequate summary of scholarship to date on the two 

Atharvaveda Saṁhitās is intended only to highlight the fact that the present moment represents an unusually lively and fertile period in Atharvaveda research. It is our hope that this volume can capture and reflect this. As is stated in the Preface, the articles contained herein are the outcome of a conference hosted within the framework of the ongoing project ‘Online Edition of the Paippalāda Recension of the 

Atharvaveda’ \(https://www.atharvaveda-online.uzh.ch/home/paippalada- recension\),  

funded in three phases by the Swiss National Science Foundation \(2017–2021; 

2021–2025; 2025–2028\). This project was jointly conceived by its two directors, Paul Widmer, Professor of Comparative Indo-European Studies in the Department of 

Comparative Language Science, and Angelika Malinar, Professor of Indian Studies 

in the Department of Indian Studies at the Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies. 

Its explicit aim is to bridge the disciplinary approaches of linguistics and philology in creating a digital critical edition of Books 1, 4, 10, 12 and 19 of the PS, along with English translations, a full morpho-lexical analysis, detailed linguistic and Indological comments, and documentation of parallel passages in other texts. Inevitably, by far the most parallels are found in the ŚS, and the project therefore endeavours to make new and valuable contributions to the study of this text also. 

In keeping with these aims, we invited the world’s leading scholars of the Athar-

vaveda \(from Europe, India, Japan and North America\) to present their research on linguistic, philological, literary and historico-cultural aspects of either recension of this text. Of course, the study of the Atharvaveda is rarely just that, for its antiquity and its cutural importance ensure close contacts with other texts and traditions, be they Vedic, post-Vedic, or more broadly Indo-European, and we especially encouraged contributions that explored these connections and interactions. The articles collected in this volume accordingly span a broad range of disciplinary approaches and subject matter. We have tried to impose some sort of thematic structure to the volume, but as always with such exercises, different arrangements could have been settled on. 

The first four articles all study the language of the Atharvaveda, which is 

placed in its Vedic context. Knobl offers a rich and wide-ranging study of relative

clauses in old Vedic. He focuses especially on a comparison between what he calls the *ETÁD–YÁD* construction \(see his footnote 6 for an explanation of the orthography\), which occurs first \(albeit very rarely\) in the Rigveda, and the *ETÁD–yád* construction, which is first attested in prose passages of the Atharvaveda. In the former, Knobl argues, the *YÁD* clause almost always has a non-restrictive, appositive function, with the *there*–deictic demonstrative pronoun *ETÁD * functioning more or less independently. In these cases the relative pronoun \( *YÁD*\) is flexible, changing its gender and number in grammatical agreement with *ETÁD*. By contrast, in the *ETÁD–yád* construction, *yád * restricts and defines *ETÁD* and has itself lost its variability, it has become fixed \(thus Knobl’s neologism “*yád figé*”\). 

The article by Widmer and Hellwig provides a survey of continuity in the lin-

earization of complex nominal expressions in Vedic texts, with a special focus on the Atharvaveda. The authors extract 8,789 complex nominal expressions from a 

corpus of dependency-annotated Vedic texts and conduct statistical tests to understand the interactions between continuity and two properties of the modifier. In 

this way, the study complements previous qualitative work that focused on seman-

tics but used a considerably smaller number of data points. 

In his brief remarks on issues pertaining to the place of the Atharvaveda, and 

especially the PS, in the chronology of Vedic literature, Lubotsky argues on linguistic grounds that the bulk of the Atharvavedic hymns \( *sūktá*-\) most likely acquired their final shape at approximately the same time as the tenth book of the Rigveda, while the prose passages \(the so-called *paryāya* sections\) are contemporaneous with those of the Yajurveda. In pursuing a *terminus ante quem*, at least for the PS, Lubotsky defers to Bronkhost’s \(2007, 197\) rather imprecise claim that it must have 

“existed essentially in its present form” by the time of Patañjali \(2nd century BCE\), who quotes its opening pāda and appears to recognise that it consists of 20 kāṇḍas. 

Hellwig undertakes a quantitative approach to the vocabulary of the ŚS. Dis-

tinguishing between words shared by old Vedic sources and those first occurring in later texts, he is able to reproduce textual stratifications of the ŚS postulated on the basis of style and content in previous research. 

Working within a tradition of Indo-European studies that is concerned with 

poetic language \(Indogermanische Dichtersprache\), Massetti examines an Athar-

vavedic passage \(PS 4.15.6–7 ∼ ŚS 4.12.6–7\) in which a simile compares a healer 

of a broken bone to a craftsman \( *r̥bhú*-\) fixing a chariot. She then traces phraseological correspondences between these two stanzas and a passage from an ode by 

Pindar \(Pythian 3.47–53\), and argues that the metaphor of the healer as a crafts-

man or “fashioner” \(complementary to the metaphor of the body as a chariot\) is 

but one of several “thematic matches” between the two texts. Massetti concludes 

that the correspondences she uncovers speak strongly in favour of a “common 

background”.

Robert Leach, Oliver Hellwig and Thomas Zehnder

The contribution of Pooth re-edits and translates substantial parts of the last 

anuvāka of kāṇḍa PS 18 \(= PS 18.76–82\). According to the interpretation presented here, this passage describes the burial ceremony and the construction of a burial mound for a dead king. While many of the conclusions arrived at may be viewed 

as being based on a preconceived hypothesis, there are nonetheless important 

insights here on a fascinating and difficult textual passage. 

The next two contributions try to make sense not of a long passage, but of 

a single phrase found in both Atharvaveda Saṁhitās. Pontillo focuses on the 

phrase *páñcaudana- ajá*-, which denotes a billy goat offered with five portions of mashed rice, in the context of a sacrifice aimed at gaining access to heaven. Pontillo undertakes a lexically grounded comparison with other Vedic texts, especially the *Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa*, and proposes that the billy goat might have originally represented the individual self with its five sense organs, and that this offering sought to achieve not merely a temporary stay in heaven, as would be the norm for such a sacrifice, but a permanent deathless state. Leach explores the possible meanings of the word *śvànvant*-, attributed to Apsarases in the ŚS and PS but not found outside these texts. He highlights the difficulty in unravelling the meaning of this rarely-attested epithet, but suggests in his final analysis that ‘dogs’ \( *śván*-\) most likely refers, metaphorically, to either death or the Gandharvas. One way of making sense of the latter metaphor, he argues, is to view the figure of the Gandharva alongside related figures from other branches of Indo-European mythology. 

The following two contributions deal with the reception of the Atharvaveda 

and specifically the ways in which it has been categorised as a text and a set of cultural practices, in the first case by modern scholars and in the second, by other, often rival, Brahmanical traditions. Whitaker offers a polemical critique of the scholarly application of ‘magic’ and related concepts when interpreting and classifying the Atharvaveda. He views this hermeneutic practice as a “systemic problem” that is 

not only inherently disapproving and exclusionary, but is theoretically shallow and unreflective, and he urges that we do away with it. In response to the sort of simplistic binaries \(e.g. religion vs magic\) criticised by Whitaker, some scholars have, as Spiers shows, marched too hurriedly in the opposite direction and, eager to uproot all such schematic oppositions, they end up eliding all difference. Spiers provides an overview of the ways in which Śrauta and then Smārta Brahmans have in fact 

attempted to marginalise the Atharvaveda “from the beginning of its history”, and she suggests several reasons why they may have been compelled to do so. 

Several of the issues raised by Whitaker and Spiers are also pertinent to Mali-

nar’s study of ritual practices associated with the Atharvaveda in the *Mahābhārata*. 

Malinar argues that while there were attempts to marginalise the Atharvaveda and 

its representative practices, this should not occlude the fact that the fourfold Veda

became canonical and that several of these practices came to be incorporated into the domestic ritual repertoire of the Brahmanical householder. Malinar addresses 

several narrative episodes in the *Mahābhārata* which can elicit a more nuanced understanding of apparently hostile practices such as *abhicāra* and *kr̥tyā*, demonstrating that their acceptance \(for example in situations of familial, and especially conjugal, tension\) depends upon the extrinsic factors of context and motivation. 

Amano’s contribution is also primarily concerned with the Atharvaveda as it 

is reflected in another text, in this case the *Maitrāyaṇī-Saṁhitā *\(MS\). Undertaking a detailed numeric evaluation of the distribution of citations from the Rigveda and the two Atharvaveda Saṁhitās in the mantra portions of the MS, Amano is able to 

identify changes in the status and accessibility of these earlier works for the MS’s authors based on the frequency and accuracy of these citations. With respect to the Atharvaveda Saṁhitās, she proposes that in the earlier phases of the MS’s composition there was closer contact with Śaunaka priests, and in the later phases with Paippalāda priests. 

Zehnder also deals with citations of the Atharvaveda in a later work. Encour-

aged by sporadic cases in which Vedic quotations in Indian grammatical literature led to an improvement in the understanding of the Saṁhitās, he undertakes a systematic search for the Vedic quotations found in Patañjali’s *Mahābhāṣya* in the text of the PS. Happily, he succeeds in discovering the source of quite a number of hith-erto untraced Vedic quotations in the *Mahābhāṣya*. 

The final three articles in the volume concern themselves with ritual elements 

in later Atharvavedic tradition. Bahulkar presents a wide-ranging overview of the prescriptions for domestic rituals as found in the Śaunaka and the Paippalāda traditions up until modern times, with a particular focus on the differences in the 

rites enjoined in each Śākhā for the new and full moon sacrifice \(Darśapūrṇamāsa\). 

Considerable divergences between the two Śākhās are described, and the influence 

of local traditions is noted. Rotaru provides an in-depth investigation into two 

Atharvanic rites that accompany the building of a house in the *Kauśikasūtra*. She traces the \(re-\)interpretations these rites have encountered in the commentarial 

literature and in a late prayoga manual, compares them to house-building rites in other Vedic schools, and argues that only one of these is actually a proper construction rite. This study is grounded in a discussion of the textual divisions employed in the *Kauśikasūtra*, a crucial matter for the interpretation of this text. Sumant offers a rich description of the section on neonatal rites in the *Karmapañjikā*, a domestic ritual manual belonging to the Paippalāda tradition that was composed in Odisha 

in the 16th century. She shares several interesting observations on the peculiar language and style of this text before presenting the edited text itself together with an English translation.
