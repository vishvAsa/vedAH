The articles collected in this volume are the outcome of the 3rd Zurich International Conference on Indian Literature and Philosophy \(ZICILP\), *The Atharvaveda and its* *South Asian Contexts*, held over three days \(September 26th–28th\) at the University of Zurich in the autumn of 2019. We are extremely grateful to Angelika Malinar 

for supporting this event with funds granted to her personally by the University 

of Zurich for the ZICILP series of conferences. We would like to warmly thank 

everyone who participated in the conference and who thereby contributed to an 

extremely enjoyable and instructive three days. Our sincere thanks also to the 

Swiss National Science Foundation \(SNSF\) – and to the Swiss taxpayer – for funding since 2017 the ongoing project ‘Online Edition of the Paippalāda Recension of the 

Atharvaveda’ \(https://www.atharvaveda-online.uzh.ch/edition\) within the framework of which we were able to host this conference. We would also like to thank the University of Zurich for providing the room and technical support. Our gratitude 

to Angelika Malinar and Paul Widmer, the directors of this project, cannot be adequately expressed here, but we note it nonetheless. Two integral members of the 

team whose names do not appear again in these pages, but whose technical support 

we could not do without are Magdalena Plamada and Reto Baumgartner. Finally, 

our thanks to Samantha Döbeli for her pivotal part in organising the conference. 

It was with great sadness that we learnt, just a few days before the peer review 

process started, that Werner Knobl \(1942–2023\), one of our three invited speakers, had passed away. His contribution appears herein in the form of his final draft 

which was about to be sent out for review. We are immensely grateful to be able 

to include within this volume a late offering from such a learned and distinctive scholar. He will be missed by many in our field.
