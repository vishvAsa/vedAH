**Introduction. Textual Divisions **

**of the Kauśika Sūtra**

The Kauśika Sūtra \(KauśS\) has the following textual divisions: adhyāyas \(14\), 

kaṇḍikās numbered from the beginning of each adhyāya \(this is an intrinsic divi-

sion of the adhyāya, varying in number\), kaṇḍikās numbered from the beginning of 

the first adhyāya \(141\), and sūtra. The first adhyāya which contains the metarules and sources of the texts, etc., is an exception and does not have the first type of kaṇḍikā. The manuscripts seen by me so far unanimously do not break the sūtras 

and, consequently, do not count them, but they invariably count the adhyāyas and 

have a different numbering system for the two types of kaṇḍikās, i.e. numbered 

from the beginning of each adhyāya, and numbered from the beginning of the first 

adhyāya. This will be shown in the following. 

The two types of counting the kaṇḍikās has been understood differently by 

scholars who have dealt with the text. Bloomfield’s edition recognizes these four divisions, yet, while referring to a passage, the editor gives preference to the reference to kaṇḍikā counted from the beginning of the first adhyāya, and sūtra, and so do Caland and later Gonda in their translations. Lanman \(1906: 1012\) is the first to have a critical opinion on the issue. Having noticed that Sāyaṇa refers to the KauśS 

by adhyāya and “by kaṇḍikā as numbered from the beginning of each adhyāya” 

and that “Bloomfield and Whitney cite \(underlined by J.R.\) by kaṇḍikā as numbered from the beginning of the treatise”, Lanman thinks the best way of reference is 

“by adhyāya, by kaṇḍikā as numbered from the beginning of the adhyāya and by 

sūtra.” 

Bahulkar \(1990: 119\) implements this threefold division of the text considering 

it “traditional”, as opposed to a probably invented division of Bloomfield \(personal communication, January 2013\). Although Bahulkar refers to Lanman, he seems 

to have missed the latter’s distinction between “kaṇḍikā as numbered from the 

beginning of each adhyāya” and “kaṇḍikā as numbered from the beginning of the 

treatise”. However, Bahulkar says: “In his edition, Bloomfield has numbered the 

kaṇḍikās irrespective of the adhyāya – division. i.e. kaṇḍikās 1–141 and has con-

sequently adopted only two divisions, namely, kaṇḍikās and sūtras.” This is not 

tenable; the divisions are rightly numbered in their respective places in the actual edition \(e.g. page 47: “vācayed eva vācayed eva |34| ||8||17|| ity atharvavede kau-śikasūtre dvitīyo’dhyāyaḥ samāptaḥ ||”, i.e. sūtra 34; kaṇḍikā as numbered from 

the beginning of the treatise, 8; kaṇḍikā as numbered from the beginning of first adhyāya, 17; adhyāya 2\). I have checked at random and found in the ms. Bü used 

by Bloomfield the same numbering, \(except for the sūtra\), and similarly in the ms. 

Bh 1 used by Bahulkar. 

The Textual Divisions and the Conventions mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra **375**

To sum up, Bloomfield knew the fourfold textual divisions available in some mss. 

and noted them down in the respective places in his edition. Keśava’s editors uncritically borrowed this numbering from Bloomfield \(Bahulkar, personal communica-

tion, January 2013\) leaving open for further investigation which division the medieval commentator actually knew. The same question applies to Dārila’s commentary 

available in the codex unicus, which presents the division into adhyāya and kaṇḍikā 

as numbered from the beginning of each adhyāya. Similarly, our awareness about 

Sāyaṇa’s way of dividing and numbering the KauśS is limited to the text offered by S.P. Pandit based on a single complete ms. and another incomplete ms., which presents the same division assumed by modern exegetes as “traditional”. Griffiths, in his GRETIL electronic edition,1 puts in square brackets \[\] the kaṇḍikā as numbered from the beginning of the treatise, a method pursued in this paper also, and restores to the KauśS its original fourfold division, which is a merit of this e-edition. 

While the most prevalent system of reference, that of adhyāya and kaṇḍikā 

as numbered from the beginning of the treatise, for all of its convenience may be still used, it should not omit the significance of the various textual divisions of the KauśS. The present paper addresses this subject in regard to the internal division of the third adhyāya, as a prerequisite for seeking a correspondence between phalādhikāra \(see further § 1.4 for this term\) and kaṇḍikā as numbered from the begin-

ning of each adhyāya division. 

It is commonly considered that the KauśS prescribes two ceremonies accompa-

nying the building of a house, at 3.6 \[23\].1–11 and at 5.7\[43\].3–15. However, it is difficult to ascertain precisely which sūtras prescribe the construction rite in the 23rd kaṇḍikā. Bloomfield \(1889\) rubricates 3.6\[23\].1–11 as “rites on building a house”. 

Caland \(1900: 147–148\) thinks that only the sūtras 3.6\[23\].1–9 prescribe rites for good luck in a new residence. Keśava2 and more specifically the late unpublished 

paddhati Atharvaṇīya Paddhati \(AthPaddh\) comment on the sūtras 3.6\[23\].1–6 as 

describing a rite for prosperity upon building a new house, whereas 3.6\[23\].7 and 8 are marked as two rites for prosperity, and 3.6\[23\].9–11 for one who wishes to 

divide his property. As for the rite prescribed in the 43rd kaṇḍikā, the traditional and the modern exegesis agree in understanding that it is a ritual accompanying 

the building of a big house. 

In the following we shall analyse these rites as prescribed by KauśS 3.6\[23\].1–6 

and 5.7\[43\].3–15 and later unpublished Ātharvaṇic ritual sources, such as the 

AthPaddh, already mentioned, and the late prayoga Samskāraprayogaratna \(SPR, 

see Rotaru 2021\).

In the structure of the rite there appear two verses which occur in the Paip-

palāda Saṃhitā \(PS\) and are found with minor variants as ṚV 7.54.1 and 7.55.1, 

which represent an invocation to Vāstoṣpati. The second part of the paper will focus on the exact identification of the verses addressing Vāstoṣpati in the ritual texts of the Atharvavedins, and the employment of ṚV 7.54.1–3 and 7.55.1 by the ritual texts of other Vedic schools. This is a chapter in the long story of how the Ātharvaṇic priests have constructed some missing portion in their rituals based on the texts of a bigger ritual tradition represented by the three canonical Vedas.

“When building a new house, with the hymn “The sacrificial formulae at the sacrifice. . .” 

\(ŚS 5.26\) he offers in the fire ghee mixed with honey. \[He sacrifices\] the second \[oblation\] with the hymn “Sing at evening. . .” \(ŚS 6.1\). The third, jointly with the two \[hymns\]. The fourth, with the verse to Anumati \(i.e., ŚS 7.20.6\).5 Having sprinkled the house by means of the two little fingers, sitting with his wife in the kitchen,6 he pours out water from the pitcher. With the verse “Stay right here\!. . .” \(ŚS 7.60.7\) he releases his speech.” 

**1.2 **Keśava has comments in the manner of glosses upon the sūtras, but he explains this rite in detail at the end of his commentary ad KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15, from where it is further copied with innovations by the AthPaddh. 

**3** Edition: aśnāti. Caland 1900, based on Sāyaṇa’s reading under the hymn ŚS 6.1 and probably on Keśava’s reading in the commentary \(for in the mūlā the lectio is aśnāti\), considers aśnāti to be a lapsus calami for juhoti. Dārila, in the mūlā source text and in the bhāṣya commentary:  juhoti. AthPaddh: juhoti. Based on all these readings, we may retain Caland’s emendation as juhoti. Keśava’s editors retain the reading of Bloomfield’s edition in the reconstructed mūla root text.

“Next, on the model of the pākayajña, \[he does\] the pouring \[with the formula\] “I pour what is acceptable to the Lord of the house\!”; the sprinkling \[with the formula\] “I sprinkle you, so as to be acceptable to the Lord of the house\!”; the offering of barhi grass \[with the formula\] 

“May the oblation go to the Lord of the house, svāhā\!”. Having done the offering of the milk porridge for the Lord of the house and having completed the ājyabhāga \(ghee offering for Soma and Agni10\), he offers rice with the two stanzas “Acknowledge, O Lord of the house\!”. 

Next, he continues with the second part of the rite, beginning with the pārvaṇa \(offerings to the “junctions”11\). Some12 offer in this rite the offering ending with the abhyātāna.13 With the hymn of twelve verses “The sacrificial formula at the sacrifice. . .” \(ŚS 5.26\) they offer at once in the new house ghee mixed with honey as the first āhuti \(offering\). He offers the second āhuti with the hymn “Sing at evening. . .” \(ŚS 6.1\). He offers the third āhuti jointly with the two \[mentioned hymns\], and the fourth to Anumati. The priest holds the pitcher with water and sprinkles the house with the two little fingers. The sacrificer and his wife sitting inside the house, silently pour water from the pitcher on the earth. In the beginning the priest and the others restrain their speech. They release their speech with the stanza “Stay right here\!. . .” \(ŚS 7.60.7\). He continues the second part of the rite beginning with the abhyātāna offerings.” 

**7** Cf. KauśS 3.6\[23\].1: **yajuṃṣi yajña** \(ŚS 5.26\) iti navaśālāyāṃ sarpimadhumiśram aśnāti /

**11** See Rotaru 2021: 168 for this rite in the Ātharvaṇic tradition. 

**12** This divergent opinion is applicable only in the case of the rite prescribed by KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15, whereas in case of the ceremony prescribed by KauśS 3.6\[23\].1–6, this injunction refers to the main rite. 

**13** Lit. “stretching”, a peculiar rite performed between the first part and the second part of the ājyahoma. This rite is described by KauśS 137. See Rotaru 2021: 300, fn. 272.

The Textual Divisions and the Conventions mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra **379**

**1.4 **As reconstructed from the ritualistic exegesis, the ceremony described by KauśS 

3.6\[23\].1–6 consists in an offering to Vāstoṣpati on the model of the pākayajña23 

followed by the main rite. The latter is simple and consists of four offerings of ghee mixed with honey accompanied by the recitation of two hymns belonging to pauṣṭik-agaṇa,24 employed individually and jointly, and one verse addressing Anumati. The injunction “ānumatīṃ caturthīm” \(KauśS 3.6\[23\].4\) occurs in three other contexts: for obtaining Vedic knowledge through magic \(5.6\[42\].11\); in the cow immolation 

\(5.9\[45\].10\); in the funeral rites \(11.3\[82\].38\). In all these occurrences it concludes the fourth oblation, the first two being done with recitation of hymns appropriate to the ceremonies in question, and the third, with the two respective hymns. Anumati is invoked in all these contexts in her quality of being gracious, bounteous and specifically, for completing the sacrifice \(see ŚS 7.20.4b: no yajñaṃ pipṛhi – “complete our sacrifice\!”; 7.20.5a: emaṃ yajñam anumatir jagāma – “Anumati came to this 

sacrifice”; 7.20.5d: semaṃ yajñam avatu devagopā – “Protected by divine folk, may she preserve this rite”; etc\). The actual vāstuśānti \(expiation ceremony for a new house\) is silently performed by the priest who enters the house holding a pitcher with water which he sprinkles around with his little fingers. The sacrificer and his wife receive, also silently, the pūrṇaghata \(auspicious “filled pot”\), and place it on the floor. At the end of this meditation, the appropriate mantra “Stay right here\!. . .” 

\(ŚS 7.60.7\) is recited. There is no mention of the Brahmins being fed, from where we may assume that the ceremony is not an occasion for a function, as in the construction rite described at KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15, as it will be further seen. 

The ritual described by KauśS 3.6\[23\].1–6 does not have the ritual syntax of a 

proper construction rite as it is described at KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15. It is not a ritual of construction, but a ceremony performed by one who wishes to obtain prosperity 

after moving in his new residence. 

**1.5 Nested Textual Division of the Third adhyāya of the KauśS**

The third adhyāya to which the sūtras 3.6\[23\].1–6 belong, is grouping the pauṣṭika rites for prosperity. Bahulkar \(2004: 30\) considers that the rites are randomly 

grouped in this chapter, denoting a looseness of composition in the KauśS text. 

Prima facie, this holds true, as rites having the same purport occur in random **23** The pākayajña is the domestic ritual for the new moon and full moon. The following elements are specifically mentioned \(see § 1.2\): pouring of ghee, sprinkling with propitiatory water, consecration of barhis, offering of milk porridge, ājyabhāga offerings, offering of cooked rice; and abhyātāna offerings after the description of pradhānahoma. 

**24** For puṣṭikā mantrāḥ see Bloomfield ad KauśS 3.2\[19\].1, fn. 12.

mantrādhikāra

The terms mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra are explained by Dārila \(Intro. p. 1\) 

as two methods used by Kauśika in arranging the subjects of the sūtra text. The 

former reflects the sequence of the ritual subjects according to the order of the Saṃhitā hymns, and the latter, the classification consistent with the “fruits”/portents of the rites \(see Bahulkar 1994: 27–30\). Bahulkar rightly highlights that out of the two methods, Kauśika gives preference to the mantrādhikāra. The sūtra text is coined as Saṃhitā vidhi “a commentary of the Saṃhitā” \(Sāyaṇa, Introduction, in 

Vishva Bandhu et al 1990: I, 23, etc\), and therefore, the order of the rites follows the order of the mantras. The same convention applies in the arrangement inside each 

adhyāyas, as clearly indicated in the table. 

The order of the textual divisions is thus mentioned in the KauśS text: kaṇḍikās 

numbered from the beginning of each adhyāya \(k\), kaṇḍikās numbered from the 

beginning of the first adhyāya \(K\), sūtra \(s\) adhyāya \(a\).36

KauśS\{a\{k\[K\(s\)\]\}\} 

The third adhyāya classifies the rites for prosperity \(phalādhikāra\); the k is 

further dividing and grouping the rites according to the similarity of subjects 

\(phalādhikāra\); the K isolates the grouping by the mantra-usage. Each textual division isolates a segment of text/data and indicates the order of operations similar to operator precedence, the so called phalādhikāra and the mantrādhikāra. 

KauśS\{a\{k\[K\(s\)\]\}\}=mantrādhikāra\{phalādhikāra\{phalādhikāra\[mantrā-

dhikāra\(phalādhikāra\)\]\}\}

**36** E.g. 46.7.24. tṛtiyo’adhyāya samāptaḥ. 

The Textual Divisions and the Conventions mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra **383**

The nested textual divisions override the precedence conventions reflecting 

which procedures to perform first in order to evaluate the sūtra-expression and to assess the purport of the rite prescribed.

**2 Construction Rite in the Ātharvaṇic Ritual Texts**

From the conclusion § 1.4. of the previous chapter, it follows that the proper rite for construction of a building is prescribed only by the KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15. 

**2.1 KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15**

**37** For the emendation and translation of this sūtra see Rotaru and Sumant 2012, endorsing Bloomfield 1892: 1–24. 

**38** vāstoṣpatīyāni are prescribed by the paribhāṣā KauśS 1.8.23. see further note 100. 

**39** Dārila: agner dakṣiṇataḥ kulīyena \(em. by the editors kulijena\) karṣati / tatra saṁbhārān ni-dadhāti / – “He ploughs by means of a plough \(?\) at the south of the fire. There he places the utensils.” We cannot offer for the moment a better understanding of this hapax other than the explanation of Caland \(1900: 147 fn. 4\). 

**40** The hymn belongs to vāstoṣpatīyagaṇa \(see KauśS 1.8.23\). See further note 99. 

**41** The consecutive mantra having the same purport should also be inferred here, on account of the paribhāṣā KauśS 1.8.7, anantarāṇi samānāni yuktāni / – “The consecutive hymns having common use are to be employed in the ritual collectively, though the sūtra mentions the pratīka of the first hymn in the series.” \(For this paribhāṣā see Bahulkar 1977: 35, n.126\). This paribhāṣā application, which changes the understanding of the whole sūtra, is not noticed by Bloomfield 1889 or Caland 1900. 

**42** Dārila glosses for dhruvābhyām ṛgbhyām. Keśava and probably from him Bloomfield 1889; 1897; and Caland 1900 understand the “two dhruvas” as the first two stanzas of the hymn recently mentioned, ŚS 3.12. The “two dhruvas mantras” seems to be a technical term in the KauśS. See KauśS 136.7: anyaṃ kṛtvā dhruvābhyāṃ dṛṃhayitvā, wherein the “two dhruvas” are identified

\[With the hymn\] “Beyond dry sandbanks. . .” \(ŚS 7.41\)43 \[are performed the acts, namely,\] 

the sprinkling of the propitiatory water at the spot for placing \[the pitcher\], the pouring of water inside the house, and the sacrifice \[for the falcon\]. With the hymns related to Vāstoṣpati he ploughs \[the soil of the enclosure\] \[and next\] he brings the ritual utensils to the south of the fire. He performs the mahāśānti with \[the groups of hymns\] beginning with vāstoṣpatīya 

\[gaṇa\]. He throws rice and barley on the grass in the middle ditch.44 \[He throws\] sprouts of grass and pebbles sprinkled with propitiatory water in the other \[ditches\]. With the hymn 

“Right here firm. . .” \(ŚS 3.12\) he concentrates \[upon the house\] which is being measured out 

\[and next on the main pillar\] which is set up.45 Having anointed \[the main pillar\], he does as prescribed in the stanza “With due order. . .” \(ŚS 3.12.6\) \(i.e. he sets the transom over the main pillar\). With the \[mantra\] “The full <pitcher>, O woman. . .” \(ŚS 3.12.8\) \[the wife\] brings in a pitcher with water, \[and the sacrificer\] brings in the fire, \[and afterwards all\] come inside \[the house\].46 With the “two dhruvas” \(ŚS 6.87 and 88\) he should make \[the house\] firm. With the by Sāyaṇa \(intro. to ŚS 6.87\) with the two consecutive hymns ŚS 6.87 and 88 \(see also Whitney, introduction to ŚS 3.12\). The two hymns are used together in a ceremony for one who wishes firm-ness \(KauśS 7,10\[59\]13\). Dārila’s and Keśava’s editors alike are not aware of this late exegesis, and similarly Bodewitz 1978: 60, although he sensed the inappropriateness of the employment of ŚS 

3.12.1–2 while “ramming down the central post”, considering it a secondary application. 

**43** The hymn belongs to vāstugaṇa \(v. Bloomfield 1889 note ad 1.8.23\) and the two verses are called samprokṣanyau and used in sprinkling. 

**44** Dārila: pradhānasthūṇāgarte . . . “in the ditch where the main pillar has to be erected”. 

**45** See Keśava: **ihaiva dhruvām** \(ŚS 3.12\) iti sūktena mīyamānāṁ śālām anumantrayate / yadā 

sthūṇocchrīyate tadā **ihaiva dhruvām** \(ŚS 3.12\) iti sūktena anumantrayate / – “He concentrates with the hymn “Right here firm. . .” \(ŚS 3.12\) upon the enclosure which is being measured up and when the pillar is being erected he concentrates \[upon it\] with the hymn “Right here firm. . .” 

\(ŚS 3.12\).” Cf. Dārila: **ihaiva dhruvām** \(ŚS 3.12\) madhyamasthūṇām ucchrīyamāṇām anumantrayate / – “He concentrates with “Right here firm. . .” \(ŚS 3.12\) upon the central pillar which is being erected.” Cf. Bloomfield 1897: 346: “The hymn AV III, 12 is recited while the \(central post\) is being fixed and erected.”; and Caland 1900: 148: “das Lied III.12 spricht er aus, wenn der Hauptp-feiler abgemessen und aufgerichtet wird.” Bloomfield wrongly understands that Keśava, like AthPaddh \(see further at § 2.3\) read “more generally, śālām”. In fact, Keśava envisages two actions and rightly thinks mīyamānā refers to śālā and ucchrīyamāṇā to sthūṇā. Renou 1939: 488 refers precisely to this passage for the distinction between mi- and ucchri-. 

**46** See also Dārila: **pūrṇaṃ nārī**ty \(ŚS 3.12.8\) ekayā udakapūrṇaṁ ghataṁ gṛhṇāti / uttarayā

3.12.8\) he brings the pitcher full with water, with the second \[verse\] \[he brings\] the fire. All the people enter the house following these two ahead. One after the other, as per subsidiary actions. 

Thus is the nature of vidhikarma \(rites in which the entire hymns from the Saṃhitā are quoted; see 

The Textual Divisions and the Conventions mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra **385**

two hymns “śaṃbhumayobhu” \(ŚS 1.5–6\) he pours the water. He offers an oblation of milk porridge to the Lord of the house \(Vāstoṣpati\) \[with the verses\]:

O lord of the building, admit us; to us be of good entrance and free of afflictions. Take pleasure in this, on our behalf, what we ask of you: let the biped and the quadruped 

\[moving creatures\] enter here. \(PS 7.6.10, trsl. Griffiths 2009\)

Free of afflictions, O lord of the building, all the forms have entered here; a friend, a good treasure to us be\! \(PS 20.23.2\)

He feeds the Brahmins all kinds of food. \[He makes them recite\] the blessings. 

**2.2 **Keśava has a \(brief\) word by word exegesis on each sūtra which partially has been given in the footnotes at § 2.1 and § 2.3. At the end of the rite he has an ample commentary with ritualistic injunctions, ad KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15 \(see supra at § 1.2\). 

Keśava records a divergent opinion of certain ritualists \(see supra, note 12\) who employ the tantra \(prototype ritual\) described at KauśS 3.6\[23\].1–6 in the beginning of the actual construction rite. 

To sum up, Keśava assigns each sūtra to a peculiar ceremony of the construction 

rite: bhūmiśuddhi, “purification of the site” \(sūtras 3–4\), in which the sacrifice for the falcon is done on the model of the pākayajña on the very spot of the construction ground for removing the obstacles \(there are other schools of ritualists who sacrifice for the falcon in the new house itself, in the other rituals\); vāstusaṁskāra, 

“consecration of the house” \(sūtras 4–12\), which consists in ploughing the ground \(sūtra 4\) for removing the vegetal layer and sprinkling it with the propitiatory water \(mahāśānti, sūtra 5\), and various acts of construction ceremoniously performed 

\(digging the ditch for the middle pillar and consecrating the same \[sūtra 6\]; digging the other ditches and their consecration \[sūtra 7\]; measuring the enclosure and consecrating it \[sūtra 8\]; erecting the main pillar and consecrating it \[sūtra 8\]; setting the transom over the main pillar which is eventually besmeared with ghee \[sūtra 9\]; the construction proper, probably filling in the walls with grass, placing the roof, etc. 

\[sūtra 11\]\). Gṛhapraveśaḥ, i.e. the ceremony of ritually entering the house for the first time, proper starts with the installation of the pūrṇaghātā and the fire \(which presupposes the existence of a fire place; see sūtra 10\), and the entering inside of the invitees \(sūtra10\), continues with the sprinkling around of propitiatory water \(sūtra 12\) and with an offering to the Lord of the house \(sūtra 13\), and gaily ends Bahulkar 1994: 33\).” Keśava understands the sutra in the same lines. Bloomfield 1897: 343 on the hymn in question envisages one subject for the three actions: “Having taken a pitcher of water, and the fire, they enter the house while reciting the eighth stanza.”; Caland \(1901: 148\), two: “indem er die Strophe III.12.8 ausspricht, treten sie \(n.l. die Frau des Hausherrn\) mit einer mit Wasser gefüll-ten Schale, und \(er selbst\) mit dem \(in eine Schüssel gelegten\) Feuer, hinein.”

with feeding of the Brahmins summoned at the ceremony who in return make “the 

declaration of the day auspicious”, and with the old women singing and blessing. 

**2.3 **AthPaddh mainly copies Keśava’s glosses, but also adds some useful information. As it may be seen in the footnotes, the text is corrupted, and a setback as compared to Keśava’s scholarship and the general understanding of the rite.

He sprinkles the pacificatory water. Then he recites the verse “mātalī” \(ŚS 11.6.23\), and next he concludes the rite of the preparation of the pacificatory water. He sprinkles the ground with this.

“Beyond dry sandbanks. . .” \(ŚS 7.41\), he should offer a rice oblation to the deity Śyena. Next, he continues with the second part of the rite, beginning with the pārvaṇa offerings. On the place where one will build a house, he shall perform a śyenayāga. He does that.” \(Keśava ad 5.7.\[43\].3\) Or he should perform the śyenayāga in the new house, thus says the commentator Dārila. 

“Now the consecration rite upon entering the house is being described.” \(Keśava ad 5.7.\[43\].4–5\) With the four groups of hymns beginning with “Right here firm. . .” \(ŚS 3.12\)99

**3.1  Verses Addressing Vāstoṣpati in the Ātharvaṇic **

**Ritual Tradition**

As a rule, in the auxiliary Vedic literature, the mantras quoted from the Samhitā of the school of which the text belongs is referred by pratīka, a symbol composed of the incipit of the hymn or verse, while the mantras from other śākhās are quoted 

in full \(sakalapāṭha\). We have seen in the above sections that Kauśika quotes sakal-apāṭhena two mantras invoking the Lord of the house, which are considered by 

traditional exegesis, starting with the commentator Dārila as kalpajā ṛcs “mantras issued from the ritual performance”, and quoted with reliability by Keśava and the AthPaddh. Griffiths \(2004: 63 and n.34\) considers that these two mantras in KauśS 

hail from the Paippalāda tradition and that they are attributed by AthPaddh to the Śāṅkhāyana tradition because they actually occur in the śrauta and gṛhya sūtras of this school. However, as seen above, the respective fragment in AthPaddh is loosely composed, quotations from Keśava are significantly inaccurate,103 Dārila is mis-103 Besides the emendations and critical comments to the text noted in the footnotes, it should be added that there is hesitation as to the reading śyenadavatā, which is read instead senedavatā, a ritual restriction of odiosum nomen unknown to Keśava, but imposed by latter diaskeuasis on the KauśS \(Rotaru and Sumant 2012\).

quoted once, and the two verses hesitantly called vāstoṣpatīyagaṇe \(sic\!\), “the two verses belonging to Śānkhāyana”, and “the two verses issued from ritual”. Without bothering with higher textual criticism, the composer of the paddhati commentary 

might have indeed attributed the stanzas in question to the school the ritual of 

which was prevalent in his quarters, most probably Gujarat.104 

In the description of the grahayajña ‘pacification of the planets’, the SPR pre-

scribes after the worshiping of Kṣetrapati with the hymn ŚS 2.8.5, the worshiping of Vāstoṣpati, with the two stanzas in question. However, although reference is made to KauśS 5.7\[43\].13, the quoted verses have the same readings as ṚV 7.54.1 and ṚV 

7.55.1, from which they were actually taken.

the tradition, at the building of a house, one should offer individually with the four stanzas ṚV 7.54.1–3, 55.1. As it is said in the sūtra, “having offered individually with the four stanzas ṚV 7.54.1–3, 55.1”, etc”. 

Thus, the first stanza of the adjoined hymn, 7.55, does not have any connection with the traditional story associated with the rest of the hymn.111 

The hymn ṚV 7.55 occurs as such in the so called Āśvalāyana Saṃhitā, followed 

by a hymn of eight verses, 7.56, being a prayer to Vāstoṣpati for sound sleep and good dreams for the family, as well as an incantation for the avoidance of snakes biting family members. Chaubey \(2009: 45\) connects this hymn with the ceremony 

of burying a snake effigy when laying the foundation of a house, and rightly thinks it was recited in the rite of building a house. It is worth noting that Paippalādavivāhādisaṃskārapaddhati \(p. 44\) employs the whole hymn PS 7.6 together with the Śālāsūkta PS 3.20 \(≈ ŚS 3.12\) in the consecration of the arghya water for the eight serpents beginning with Ananta and so on. This is a clear indication of the employment of those mantras in a construction rite in the Paippalāda tradition. 

The four verses ṚV 7.54.1–3, 55.1 are thus employed by various ritual sūtras:

**3.2.2 ŚaṅkhGS 2.14.5–6**

atha vāstumadhye baliṃ hared etābhyaś caiva devatābhyo namo brahmaṇe brāhmaṇebhyaś ca **vāstoṣpate pratijānīhy asmān** iti \(ṚV 7.54.1\) vāstumadhye vāstoṣpataye 

Next, he presents a food offering \(bali\) in the centre of the floor to the same deities, \[another bali with\] “Salutation to Brahman and to the brāhmins\!” and with the hymn ṚV 7.54.1 to the Lord of the house in the centre of the floor. 



**111** See Wilson \(1884: 370\) for the composite character of the hymn made of three distinct parts, verse 1, verses 2–4, and 5–8, the last four corresponding to ŚS 4.5.6,5,1,3 \(PS 4.6.6,5,1,3\). The joining of the first stanza to the rest of the hymn is a mis-division. Sāyaṇa is aware of this and quotes the story from the Ṛṛgvedasarvānukramāṇiparibhāṣa 7.55 and the Bṛhadddevatā 6.3.11–13: Vasiṣṭha being hungry at the end of a three-day fast, has entered his father house during the night, searching for food. Upon Saramā’s barking at his furtive entrance, the priest lulled him to sleep with two stanzas, ṚV 7.55.2–3, and put to sleep the other attendants of Varuṇa with the last four verses of the same hymn. Bṛhadddevatā 6.3.14,15 further narrates that when Varuṇa bound him with his famous fetters, Vasiṣṭha praised his father with four successive hymns starting with a supplication to soothe Varuṇa’s wrath \(ṚV 7. 86\), a praise to the plenipotential and omniscient god \(ṚV 7.87\), a recollection of the two’s togetherness \(ṚV 7.88\), and ending with a surrender to the Almighty’s mercy, due to the poet’s \(physical\) affliction \(ṚV 7.89\).

**3.3  Discussion: Two Paippalādic Verses Addressing Vāstoṣpati **

**in the KauśS**

To sum up this section, it becomes clear that the ritual texts recognise the unity of subject of the first verse of ṚV 7.55 with the preceding hymn, i.e. ṚV 7.54, by employing these four stanzas specifically together in an offering to Vāstoṣpati, in the greater structure of a construction rite. 

However, only the first stanzas of the hymns in questions have passed, with 

some variants, to the Ātharvaṇic tradition, recorded only by the Paippalāda 

Saṃhitā, in two hymns belonging to kāṇḍa 7 and 20, respectively. The paper argues that at the level of the KauśS text, the Atharvavedins have borrowed the two 

mantras from the Paippalādic milieu and when this śākhā had become obsolete in 

their quarters, the two verses were firstly quoted in full and later borrowed from the ṚgVeda, although claiming an Ātharvaṇic source text. 

Already in the 7th century Dārila, not aware of the other śākhā, has called those two stanzas kalpajā, “issued from the ritual”. Still later, the paddhatikāra of the AthPaddh calls them śāṃkhāyikīye ṛce, “two stanzas of śāṅkhāyana”, and apud Dārila, 

kalpajā. Later on, the prayogakāra of the SPR, when in need of a mantra related 

to Vāstoṣpati, borrowed the Ṛgvedic stanza 7.54.1, but safeguarded the reference 

to svaśākhā \(i.e. the own Vedic school\) by saying that it quotes from the KauśS, 

whereas Kauśika knew the mantras from PS. 

**4 Conclusions**

In comparison with the other Vedic schools which had the construction rite con-

strued around worshiping the Lord of the house, Vāstoṣpati, the Atharvavedins had a complex ceremony \(cf. KauśS 5.7\[43\].3–15, Keśava, AthPaddh, SPR\) completed by 

the worshiping of Vāstoṣpati. As concluded in the section § 3.3, in their effort to relate their ritual tradition to the schools of greater recognition, the Ātharvaṇic ritualists have included the two mantras related to Vāstoṣpati, not borrowed from the common ritual stock, but taken from their Paippalāda Saṁhitā. When this śākhā 

has become obsolete in their quarters and they did not have access to that hymn 

collection, the two verses were firstly quoted in full and later borrowed from the ṚgVeda, although claiming an Ātharvaṇic source text. Umākānta Paṇdā in his compilation employs the whole hymn PS 7.6 together with the Śālāsūkta PS 3.20 \(≈ ŚS 

3.12\) in the preparation of the arghya water for the pacification of the eight serpents, a likely preliminary ceremony for a construction rite. Similarly, the hymn ṚV 

7.55 from the so called Āśvalāyana Saṃhitā, is followed by a prayer to Vāstoṣpati 

The Textual Divisions and the Conventions mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra **395**

and an incantation for snakes \(ṚV 7.66\), connected with the ceremony of burying a snake effigy when laying the foundation of a house \(Chaubey 2009: 45\). 

As it was already suggested in the section § 1, the only construction rite 

recorded by the KauśS is the one prescribed at 5.7\[43\].3–15, whereas the injunc-

tions at 3.6\[23\].1–6 refer to a prosperity rite performed when moving into a new 

residence. Keśava records a second ritualistic tradition, in which the latter rite forms the first part of the former complex tantra \(prototype ritual\). 

The sūtras 3.6\[23\].1–6 belong to the third adhyāya which classifies rites con-

nected with various forms of prosperity. Kauśika has arranged the text inside the adhyāya using mainly the mantrādhikāra method. The phalādhikāra device is also 

used, as nested parentheses, when Kauśika wishes to override the precedence con-

ventions. 

The mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra function as rules indicating the order 

of operations similar to operator precedence. By using these conventions Kauśika 

eliminates the notational ambiguity. The portent of the ritual prescribed by the 

sequence 3.6\[23\].1–6 as ritual for prosperity becomes thus clear. Also, these conventions allow notation to be as brief as possible, brevity being one of the virtues of the KauśS text. 

In general, in the KauśS the mantrādhikāra is granted a higher precedence, 

the sūtra text being defined as saṁhitāvidhi “a ritualistic manual explaining \[the employment\] of the \[Śaunaka\] Saṁhitā \[mantras\]” \(Sāyaṇa, Introduction, in Vishva 

Bandhu et al 1990: I, 23, etc\).
