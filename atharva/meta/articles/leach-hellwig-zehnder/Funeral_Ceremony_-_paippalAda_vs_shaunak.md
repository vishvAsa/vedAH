**The Funeral Ceremony Described in the **

**13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa \(Kāṇḍa 18\) **

**of the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā vs Its Śaunaka-**

**Saṁhitā Parallel, Interpreted from the **

**Perspective of Their Textual Differences**

**Abstract:** This article discusses pieces of textual evidence at PS 18.76.1–18.82.10, arguing that the 13th anuvāka is a description of a king’s funeral, and that the building of a burial mound was practised as part of a special funerary ritual by which the king received an outstanding grave. 

**1.1  Introduction**

In this article, I discuss pieces of textual evidence in passages occurring in the 13th anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa \(Kāṇḍa 18\) of the Atharvaveda Paippalāda-Saṁhitā 

\(PS 18.76.1–18.82.10\) and a few additional passages of the preceding funeral 

stanzas \(PS 18.75.1ff.\). My hypothesis is that there is cumulative evidence indi-

cating that the building of a burial mound was practised as a very special funer-

ary ritual either at the time of the composition of the text, or before. I suggest that the 13th anuvāka is a description of a king’s funeral and the building of a 

burial mound by which the king received special treatment and an outstand-

ing grave. This hypothesis implies that the PS text describes partial cremation 

\(“making cooked”\) of the dead person preceding a burial. The remains were then 

buried in order to protect the dead person from complete dissolution \( nírr̥ti-  f.\). 

Complete cremation \(and immersion of the ashes\) would lead to dissolution and 

would prevent the mending of the body’s limbs on his way to becoming a celestial 

son \( divás putrá-\). This is different from immersing the ashes in a river, a practice that became more respectable later. The respective PS passages can be read 

as describing partial cremation and subsequent burial embedded in the king’s 

funeral ceremony. I give the following headings to these pieces of cumulative 

evidence. These headings can serve as a first orientation, in the sense of a table of contents. Their numbers are also the numbers of the respective sections of §2 

\(e.g. 1. = §2.1.\).

The PS text passages quoted below are based on Bhattacharya’s 2011 edition, 

although I have read manuscript JM4 \(see Griffiths 2003, 353\) and parts of Ji4 \(ibid. 

p. 350\) to verify the PS text on a preliminary basis. The Śaunaka text is, in most cases, copied from the online edition available at the Göttingen Register of Electronic Texts in Indian Languages \(GRETIL\).1

**1.2  Structure and contents of the 13th anuvāka **

**of PS 18**

Since large parts of kāṇḍa 18, including anuvāka 13 \(except for the very last stanza, PS 18.82.10\), are missing in the Kashmirian manuscript \(see Zehnder 1999: 258\), 

textual criticism is a particularly delicate matter here, and many of the Odishan readings might be errors of transmission. 

As transmitted in Odisha, the 13th anuvāka \(= PS 18.76.1–18.82.10\) consists of 

70 stanzas divided into seven kaṇḍikās of ten stanzas each. There are 63 stanzas 

following the usual four-pāda scheme, and six stanzas consisting of five pādas \(76.6, 76.8, 76.9, 77.2, 78.7, including the final stanza 82.10 = RV 1.105.1\). A single stanza \(PS 

18.82.2\) consists of three pādas. The 13th anuvāka corresponds largely to ŚS 18.4, but lacks the prose parts \(ŚS 18.4.67–68, 71–74, 76–87\) and ŚS 18.4.75. Only a few stanzas have RV parallels. The parallel passages are listed in Tables 1a–1g below. Here, the **1** Input by V. Petr and P. Vavroušek, in cooperation with J. Gippert, A. Griffiths and P. Kubisch, last revised 2009.

sign ♦ indicates that the stanza is quoted and translated in this article. The sign ⟲ 

indicates that the sequential order of stanzas in the PS deviates from that in the ŚS 

or the RV. Each stanza and a few single pādas are given a title in the form of a prominent phrase occurring in the text. Tables 1a–1g thus provide an overview of the 

various steps in the procedure of the ceremony described in the text. Table 1a is an overview of the first section, a coherent group of 15 stanzas \(see Lanman in Whitney 1905: 869ff.; Weber 1896: 278\). It is treated as one ritual unit in the Kauśikasūtra \(KauśS 81.45\). Here is where Agni is invoked, the fires are kindled, and the dead man has been placed on the fire.

After PS 18.77.5, there is what can be called a section break in the text and the procedure of the funeral ceremony. The following verses are associated with the 

interment of the bone-relics \(see Table 1b\).2 

**2** See Whitney \(1905: 876\): “According to KauśS \(86.3\), the verses beginning with apūpavān \(16–24\) are used as, in each case, what is specified in the verse \( mantroktam\) is deposited in the quarters and intermediate quarters \( dikṣv aṣṭamadeśeṣu\); this is in the ceremony of interment of the bone-relics, next after the use of 4.57 and 3.72 . . .”

According to Weber \(1896: 282\), this section refers to the viaticum to be given to the dead. Notice that the PS has an apūpavān-verse that is not found in the ŚS parallel, i.e. PS 18.78.5 with yavavān ‘rich in barley’. After it, two stanzas follow that also seem to belong to this section \(see Table 1c\).

\( apūpāpihitān kumbhān\) that the gods held \(but notice that b yāṃs te devā 

adhārayan  can also mean ‘which the gods fixed for you’\). PS 18.78.7 describes the scattering of grains mixed with sesame, while Yama is invoked \(see §2.5. below\). 

After these two verses, two RV stanzas are inserted. RV 10.17.11 \(= PS 18.78.8\) is used when soma or any other liquid is spilled, while RV 10.107.4 \(= PS 18.78.9\) is about the Dakṣiṇā ‘sacrifical fee’ and its donors, presumably with the intention of reminding them to prepare their payment. 

The main keywords of the subsequent section \(see Table 1d\) are **the well** 

\(or spring, source, fountain; útsa- m.\), **the grains**, and **the waters**. It ends with the invocation of Sarasvatī, using a stanza of a Rigvedic tr̥ca addressed to this

goddess \(RV 10.17.7–9, = Lanman’s part IV\). Again, this RV stanza seems to mark a break in the flow of the recitation and the ceremony.

Stanza ŚS 18.4.48 \(= PS 18.80.5 ‘I am now making you enter into earth’\) and the 

group ŚS 18.4.58–60 find no use in the Kauśikasūtra \(see Lanman in Whitney 1905: 

870\). Lanman says that the ritual use of ŚS 18.4.44 precedes the cremation, but this is not indicated in the PS text. ŚS 18.4.50 and 49 \(= PS 18.80.6–7\) stand side by side in the Kauśikasūtra \(KauśS 82.40\). According to Lanman, the Brahmin in charge 

takes the two oxen that drew the vehicle conveying the corpse while ŚS 18.4.49 \(= 

PS 18.80.7\) is recited, and with the Dakṣiṇā verse ŚS 18.4.50 \(= PS 18.80.6\) he accepts his payment. In the PS version, he apparently accepts his payment before addressing the oxen. ŚS 18.4.51 \(= PS 18.80.8\) accompanies the strewing of Darbha grass on the pyre. According to KauśS 82.25, stanza ŚS 18.4.52 \(= PS 18.80.9\) accompanies the forming of a human figure with the bones. The bones are covered with stones at 

ŚS 18.4.53–54 \(= PS 18.80.10, 81.1\). Finally, according to Lanman \(p. 871\), stanza ŚS 

18.4.55 \(= PS 18.81.2\) accompanies the patting of a grave-mound, while ŚS 18.4.56 \(= 

PS 18.81.3\) symbolizes the taking of the hereditament by the oldest son. And one use of ŚS 18.4.57 \(= PS 18.81.4\) is in the viaticum ceremony. 

The next section is dedicated to the fathers and describes what they do or 

should do \(see Table 1f\). First, they are asked to come here \(PS 18.81.8a\), then to go away \(PS 18.81.9a\) and to come again \(PS 18.81.9c\) and finally to return to their homes \(PS 18.81.10d\). The order of these actions is different in the ŚS version, 

where the fathers are only asked to come and to go away \(ŚS 18.4.62–63\). I think 

this difference is important, and I will return to it below.

After the verses to the fathers, there is an extra stanza for when a limb has been forgotten, followed by a three-pāda stanza \(PS 18.82.2\) that invokes the earth to cover the dead. This section has three final stanzas that are also found in the Kauśikasūtra \(KauśS 89.12\). The last two verses are a blessing of gr̥hā mama ‘the houses of mine’. ŚS 18.4.65 is not found in the PS. According to Lanman \(in Whitney 1905: 871\), this is recited during the “withdrawal of the fires”. It seems to me that this 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **127**

verse is absent from the PS text because the “withdrawal of the fires” had a different place, or no place, in the procedure of the ritual that is described by the PS text. 

At the very end of the ceremony, Varuṇa is invoked to loosen the fetters and 

to forgive the sin that has been committed, since burning \(“cooking”\) a man and 

invoking Yama is not a good deed. Notice that the PS has two prayers to free the staff from Varuṇa’s revenge that are not found in the ŚS parallel \(PS 18.82.7 is quoted at KauśS 97.8; see Griffiths 2004, 83–85\).

1.105.1 The moon among the waters. \(Paṅkti\)

The prose passages belonging to the Piṇḍapitr̥yajña \(ŚS 18.4.71–87\) are not found in the PS, nor ŚS 18.4.88 \(= RV 5.6.4\). This passage accompanies the “laying on of fuel” 

according to Lanman \(in Whitney 1905: 871\). The gap is very similar to ŚS 18.4.65, which is also missing from the PS text \(as mentioned above\). If both the “withdrawal of the fires” and the “laying on of fuel” are not described in the PS, we seem to be able to infer from this that the corresponding actions had a different place, or no place, in the procedure of the ritual that is described by the PS text. A plausible explanation is that the fire was already cleared in the PS ceremony and the dead 

man was already covered with earth. I will return to this issue below. The final 

stanza is the same as RV 1.105.1 and seems to be a kind of epilogue. It is, according to my interpretation \(see Jamison & Brereton 2014, 248–249 for other interpretations of RV 1.105\), the beginning of the myth of Trita trapped in the well \(or tank: kūpa-\). This seems to correlate with **the well **\( útsa-\) mentioned earlier in the text \(PS 18.78.10 and 79.6, marked by ✶✶ and bold type in Table 1d\). In my view, such an epilogue cannot be accidental. I will return to these mythical associations below. 

Having gone through the sections and keywords, we already have an impression of 

what is going on during the ceremony. I can thus make the hypothesis that the 13th anuvāka is a quite linear description of the ongoing funeral ceremony that differs from the one described in the ŚS in various ways. But let us start at the beginning. 

The 13th anuvāka opens with invoking the Jātavedases \(viz. fires\) to make them 

ascend to their birthing mother \(Janitrī\) at PS 18.76.1. The offering-mover \(i.e. Agni, 

**128** 

Roland A. Pooth

the messenger\) has just moved the sent offerings \( havyā iṣitā\), while the singer is making them ascend \( ā rohayāmi\) together through the fatherly roads. In pāda d, dhatta loke clarifies that the dead **is placed** \(√ dhā-\) at a ‘place, space, open space’, which I translate as ‘world’ here. 

**PS 18.76.1**

ŚS 18.4.1

\[all\] ascend together. The offering-mover has just moved the sent offerings \( havyā

Bhattacharya \(2011: 1382\) edits ḍhavyeṣitā in c, which is also found in manuscript JM4. In the subsequent stanza \(PS 18.76.2\), the divine seasons arrange the sacrifice and the sacrificial instruments, the sacrificial cake and the ladles are listed. The dead person is invoked to go, together with the sacrificial instruments, by the roads that the gods travel to the heavenly world \( svarga-\). After this brief introduction, we can now turn our attention to stanzas PS 18.76.5 and 4. 

**2.1 The imitation of the universe**

The starting point for substantiating my hypothesis of a mound burial is the key phrase pratimā lokānām ‘the image of the worlds’ or ‘the imitation of the worlds’ in PS 18.76.5c. 

This is the first piece of textual evidence that motivates my working on the following research question here: Is there textual evidence for a mound burial in this part of the PS? This hypothesis came to my mind while reading the PS text and remembering what Kuz’mina \(2007: 192\) writes about the burial rites of the Andronovo Culture: How did the Andronovans bury their dead? . . . They buried their dead far from their settlement, on the river bank, and they oriented the graves to the west or south-west, the direction of the setting sun. They dug the graves into the earth and constructed a timber frame-work; in the treeless regions, they replaced it with a stone cist. They erected overhead a cover on the central supporting pillar. The grave was covered with earth by a kurgan of pyramidal form; it was surrounded by a circular or square stone fence. Like the Vedic Aryans and earliest Irani-

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **129**

ans, they too knew both burial rites – cremation and inhumation. . . . A round kurgan with a square grave in the center was a microcosm of the universe. \(Kuz’mina 2007: 192, italics mine\) In the PS funeral hymns, pratimā lokānām ‘image/imitation of the worlds’ \(PS 

18.76.5c\) seems to refer to such an idea of a “microcosm of the universe”.

Bhattacharya \(2011: 1383\) edits dhruvāṁ in b, which I emend to \+ dhruvā following the ŚS version. Whitney \(1905: 873\) comments on ŚS 18.4.5c with “the pada- mss. 

all give prati◦mā́m, as if it were accusative of pratimā́”. He adds that pratimā́m  is the reading of two manuscripts \(P. and M., described by Whitney 1905: cxii\). In PS 

18.76.5c, we seem to have the nominative pratimā \(thus Bhattacharya 2011: 1383\). 

JM4 reads pratiṣṭhāṁ pratiṣṭhā lokānāṁ ghr̥tapr̥ṣṭhī, where pratiṣṭhā  is repeated in place of the word in question. Bhattacharya also prints ghr̥tapr̥ṣṭhā\(ḥ\) in c, which probably means that he is inclined to adopt the ŚS variant. Notice that ŚS 18.4.5d is found at PS 18.76.4d \(see below\). The three sacrificial spoons metaphorically hold or carry the three spheres. In the ŚS text, the spoons hold the earth “unto me \(?\)” 

\(Whitney 1905: 873\). However, an accusative form of the first-person singular personal pronoun is odd here, and Whitney adds a question mark to his translation. ŚS 

prátīmā́ṁ  can be analyzed as práti imā́m, so that what is referred to is the earth or the body of the dead person. Pādas bcd of the ŚS version can be understood as ‘The Fixed-spoon holds the earth, the firm stand. Against this \(body/earth\), the worlds. 

The heavenly ghee-backed worlds shall milk each and every wish for the Yajamāna.’ 

The PS text does not seem to describe the same things as the ŚS version. In the ŚS, **3** This is 2. svadhā́- ‘invigorating drink, sacrificial potion \(especially the one offered to the deceased fathers\)’. 

**130**

it is the heavenly worlds that shall milk each and every wish for the Yajamāna. 

Here, the two words svargā́ḥ and lokā́ḥ reoccur in pāda c of the preceding stanza \(ŚS 18.4.4, see below\), whereas the PS text has no such repetition in the context, so that ŚS 18.4.5c lokā́ ghr̥tápr̥ṣṭhāḥ svargā́ḥ  could be due to a perseveration of the preceding svargā́ lokā́ḥ.  This repetition might also be the reason why the āmreḍita kā́maṁkāmam is following in ŚS 18.4.5d here, as it is following svargā lokāḥ at PS 

18.76.4. The sense of the PS text becomes clearer once we interpret it as a description of an imitation or a microcosm of the universe.4 This passage is preceded by the description of the position of the three spoons \(PS 18.76.4, see below\). If we take the imitation of the worlds as referring to a mound, the three spoons should metaphorically describe the poles or pillars within the mound, holding the ceiling and propping up the space in between, thus making it an earth room \(earthy world, place\) for the dead person. PS 18.76.4b can be read as such a description, when we take the three spoons as being leaned to the back of the ceiling.

Bhattacharya \(2011: 1383\) edits uparasyāsakhāyū \(with a partial underline\) and mentions the variant reading ºsakhāya of manuscript Mā\[kandā\] in his apparatus. 

JM4 has ºsakhāyū. I owe the emendation \+ sakhāyau  to a discussion with Alexander Lubotsky \(personal communication\) and the emendation \+uparasyāḥ \(gen. sg. f.\) to Thomas Zehnder. JM4 has viṣṭā in c, while Bhattacharya prints viṣṭā\(ḥ\). This word can be understood as the verbal adjective viṣṭa-  of the verb √ viṣ-, characterizing the preceding svargā lokāḥ \(nominative plural masculine\), whereas ŚS  viṣṭhā́ḥ is a root compound vi \+ sthā́- \(√ sthā-\) that can be understood as ‘standing against **4**  ghr̥tápr̥ṣṭhā indicates that the imitation, and the spoons to be burnt, were sprinkled with ghee. 

In the ŚS, this accompanied the symbolic laying of the spoons on the dead body \(KauśS 81.7\). Their symbolic sense is that the sacrifice forms and holds the universe “with the ritual fire a pillar connecting heaven and earth” \(Jamison & Brereton 2014: 24\). 

**5** We can interpret nākasya pr̥ṣṭhe and adhi viṣṭapi as referring to the same thing \(suggested to me by Robert Leach\). 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **131**

each other, in all directions’ referring to the spoons/eagles and the three spheres. 

Lanman \(in Whitney 1905: 873\) notes that some ŚS manuscripts \(Whitney’s P.M.I. 

and Pandit’s C\) also read viṣṭā́ \(i.e. viṣṭā́ḥ\) in c, which is also Sāyaṇa’s reading and adopted by Weber \(1896: 279; “durchdrungen”\) and Whitney \(1905: 873; “filled 

\[?\]”\). The difference between PS viṣṭāḥ and ŚS viṣṭhā́ḥ becomes significant once we interpret the PS text as a description of an imitation of the universe that they have drawn up, worked out, prepared, and erected in the form of a mound including 

heavenly spheres for the dead person with a cave that is finally filled with the dead body, whereas they are not referring to such a thing when they use viṣṭhā́ḥ in the Śaunaka recension. The ŚS stanza seems to refer solely to a symbolic laying of the spoons on the dead body. This matches the later interpretation of the text. According to KauśS 81.7, the sacrificial instruments are placed on the different parts of the dead body, to be burnt with the dead. Recall that when an āhitāgni dies, his body is cremated in his fire along with the sacrificial utensils. Here, we can take them as symbols for the firmament, the space in between, and the earth. In the PS passage just discussed \(PS 18.76.4 and 5\), we can understand the imitation of the universe as a mound that is actually prepared as such an image or imitation. In the ŚS version, however, the spheres are symbolized by putting the three spoons on the dead body. 

We may conclude that something happened to the liturgical context of the cere-

mony with regard to what was done during the recitation of these passages. In 

other words, the imitation of the universe seems to be more symbolic in the ritual of the Śaunakins, whereas it appears to be more literal in that of the Paippalādins. 

Note that the Fixed-spoon \( dhruvā\) is invoked to **ascend the earth** in pāda a of the following passage. If my interpretation is correct, this was the pillar that propped up the earth \( pr̥thivīm\). 

**PS 18.76.6**

**132** 

Roland A. Pooth

If one assumes that this sacrificial utensil is placed on a part of the dead body, this implies that its ascending the earth can only be understood symbolically. However, interpreted in light of my hypothesis of a mound burial, the description makes good sense: The Fixed-spoon will stand for a pillar that is fixed in the ground, “ascending the earth”, holding the ceiling, and propping up the space in between as if going up to heaven above, as explicitly outlined in the apūpavān- verses \(PS 18.77.6ff., see 

§2.2. below\). The word viśvavedasam ‘knowing/seeing everything’ in PS 18.76.6a might be a description of the earth that is lifted as a mound in its natural environment with a panoramic view. ŚS has viśvábhojasam ‘all-nourishing’ instead. The form dhukṣāḥ, if interpreted correctly, is the first instance of the subjunctive of a sa- aorist found in the Vedic corpus \(at least no other form of this category is noted by Macdonell 1910: 385\).

Through fords they cross the great slopes, \[on the way\] by which the sacrifice-

JM4 has yadi kalpayanta in pāda d, while Bhattacharya \(2011: 1384\) prints mayi kalpayanta\(ḥ\). I opt for the former, because it is closer to ŚS yád ákalpayanta and a temporal meaning ‘when they are mending the ghosts’ makes sense in the context 

of a funeral ceremony. The preposition phrase pravato mahīr anu also occurs at RV 10.14.1a: pareyivā́ṁsam praváto mahī́r ánu “to the one who has departed along the great slopes” \(Jamison & Brereton 2014: 1391\). In pāda d I do not understand bhūtāni  as ‘creatures’, as suggested by Whitney \(1905, 874\), but – following a suggestion to me by Umberto Selva \(personal communication\) – as ‘ghosts’ \(some kind 

of more or less aimlessly wandering ghosts\) of the dead that are mending \(repair-

ing\) themselves or are being mended \(that is, their bodies are being repaired in a special way\). 

In the following PS passage, we find the new Vedic word padmānam \(accusa-

tive singular\). It is not a hapax legomenon because it reoccurs at PS 18.77.2. In both passages, it denotes something that belongs to Agni \( padmānam agneḥ\).

JM4 has padmānam  in d and śagmaṁ in e, as printed by Bhattacharya \(2011: 1384\). 

Since PS padmānam  fits into the meter, whereas ŚS mahimā́nam ‘greatness’ does not, it seems that it is original. The second attestation of padmānam agner  is found in the following passage:

**PS 18.77.2** \(ab: only PS\)

médhyam \(i.e. the pure thing that is ready and fit for being sacrificed\) belonging to Prajāpati, the Jātavedases, making \[him\] boiled, they shall not . . . \(† vicakṣaṇam†\) here\! 

JM4 has samya enaṁ in b, Bhattacharya \(2011: 1385\) edits samaṅganaṁ.  I emend this to \+ samyaṅ enaṁ. The meaning of padmānam cannot be easily determined. It seems to be a verbal abstract with the suffix -mán- derived from the root √ pad- ‘fall, go’. We only know that it is characterized by the adjective śagmá- ‘strong?, favour-able?’ in PS 18.76.8de, and that it is something the dead man can go to \( úpa yā-\). In pāda e, mā vicakṣaṇam seems to be a corruption of mā́va cikṣipan as preserved in the ŚS parallel. At least, a noun \(‘conspicuous, experienced’\) does not fit the syntactic context. Bhattacharya attempts to restore a finite verb \( iha mā vi cakṣaṇan\* 

**134** 

Roland A. Pooth

‘they shall not have completely hurt \[damaged\] him here’??\). Lanman comments on 

ŚS 18.4.12c mā́ áva cikṣipan as follows:

Here, cikṣipan with ava  means ‘let them \[the fires, not\] throw \[any part of the dead man\] 

down’; that is, Agni \(in his kindly forms, śivā́s tanvàs\) is to treat the dead man kindly and not let a foot, the head, or a hand fall off from the funeral pile, but is to consume him completely: cf. the comm., who aptly says, yathā niravaśeṣaṁ dahyate tathā. The importance, in Hindu belief, of having every member of the body carried by Agni to the other world for use in the next life is abundantly shown by the hymns . . . — When, as often happens, the pile of wood is too short for the corpse, the feet will naturally overhang and drop off from the pyre. In my journal of a visit at Benares, under date of Feb. 25, 1889, I find the following: ‘Saw a cremation, at the Burning Ghat. One foot of the corpse fell off the pyre \(which was none too long\), and a man tried to put it back on the fire with a bamboo. But failing, he took it by the toe with thumb and fingers and chucked it back.’ An allusion to an occurrence of this kind is clearly made by the Chāndogya Upanishad at vii. 15.3 . . . \(Lanman in Whitney 1905: 875\). 

The corruption PS \(Odisha\) vicakṣaṇam instead of ŚS \(á\)va cikṣipan is similar to PS 

\(Odisha\) cakṣuṣaḥ \(‘of the eyesight’\) instead of RV, ŚS cikṣipaḥ at PS 18.63.8b: māsya tvacaṁ † cakṣuṣo†  mā śarīram  vs. RV 10.16.1b \(= ŚS 18.2.4b\) mā́sya tvácaṁ cikṣipo mā́ 

śárīram “don’t singe his skin nor his body” \(translation by Jamison & Brereton 2014: 1395\). Jamison \(1983, 140, with fn. 71\) interprets cikṣipaḥ at the RV passage as the reduplicated aorist of √ kṣā- ‘burn, singe’ \(i.e. of its causative kṣāpáya-\) – against the other approach which derives this form from √ kṣip- ‘throw, cast’ – and this \(‘burn’\) may also be intended here at PS 18.77.2e, presumably in the sense that they shall not burn and damage the dead body completely \(see the following section §2.2.\). 

**2.2 The path to heaven is vitara-**

Within the funerary ceremony, Agni is envisioned as a transformer, not necessarily as a complete destroyer. His function is that of a general carrier, and he carries the dead body to prolonged or eternal life, as, for example, in the following RV stanza: RV 10.16.11 yé **agníḥ** **kravyavā́hanaḥ** pitr̥̄́n yákṣad r̥tāvŕ̥dhaḥ | préd u havyā́ni vocati devébhyaś ca pitŕ̥bhya ā́ ‖ “**Der Leichen fortführende Agni**, der den wahrheitstärkenden Vätern opfern soll, er möge den Göttern und den Manen die Opferspende ansagen.” \(Geldner 1951c: 149\). 

The dead bodies were sometimes completely burnt and sometimes incompletely 

burnt, as described in this RV passage:

RV 10.15.14 yé **agnidagdhā́ **yé **ánagnidagdhā **‘  mádhye diváḥ svadháyā mādáyante | tébhiḥ 

svarā́ḷ ∙ ásunītim etā́ṁ ‘ yathāvaśáṁ tanvàṁ kalpayasva ‖ “Those burned by fire and those not burned by fire who become exhilarated at \(the cry of\) “svadhā” in the middle of heaven, along 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **135**

with them \(go\) as sovereign king \(on the way\) leading to \(the other\) life. Arrange your body as you wish.” \(Jamison & Brereton 2014: 1394, emphasis mine\). 

In this passage, the verb kalpayasva clearly refers to the repairing, fixing, arranging, and adjusting of the dead body for eternal life. Completely burning a dead 

body would destroy the person, as explicitly outlined in RV 10.16.1a: máinam agne ví daho mā́bhí śocaḥ ‘Do not burn him through, O Agni, do not let him glow.’ It is thus clear from the text that the dead body is incompletely burnt. The function of the earth within the funerary ritual is to protect the dead from complete dissolution \( nírr̥ti-\), as explicitly stated in the following passage:

RV 10.18.10 úpa sarpa mātáram bhū́mim etā́m uruvyácasam pr̥thivī́ṁ suśévām | ū́rṇamradā 

yuvatír dákṣiṇāvata **eṣā́** **tvā pātu nírr̥ter upásthāt** ‖ “Creep upon this mother earth, the broad earth of wide expanse, who is very kindly. The young girl, soft as wool for the one who gives priestly gifts – **let her protect you from the lap of Dissolution**.” \(Jamison & Brereton 2014: 1401, emphasis mine\). 

As indicated here, burials assure that the body is not completely destroyed by the fire \(see Oberlies 1998: 472\). Vedic burials are also confirmed by PS 18.68.2 and its parallel ŚS 18.2.52ab \(Oberlies 1998: 299–312, especially fn. 727 with further references\). In the PS passage given below, the dead’s first path is entering the pr̥ṣṭhá- 

‘mountain back, ridge’ to fly up to the sky in the future \( divam utpatiṣyan\). This is the **further \(viz. second\)** path \( panthā vitaraḥ\), the heavenly path. 

**PS 18.77.4**

In pāda a, the Odishan manuscripts read Ja īhajānaś, Mā ihajānaś, JM4 ihajanaś, which Bhattacharya \(2011: 1386\) emends to \*ījānaś following the ŚS parallel. As Whitney \(1905: 876\) points out, the second word of this stanza should be read as 

citám ‘piled’, as transmitted by a number of ŚS manuscripts, and this also applies to the PS, where all manuscripts have cittam. In pāda d Bhattacharya’s manuscripts \(Ja, Mā\) have pitaro devajānaḥ, which he \(2011: xci\) emends to \*vitaro \*devayānaḥ. 

The latter is what I read in JM4, so that editorial symbols can be removed. I understand this pāda as describing a ‘**further \(= second\)** path’ to the sky that was taken 

**136** 

Roland A. Pooth

by the gods. In PS 18.77.5d, on the other hand, the sacrifice shall go the **earlier** **track** \( pūrvam ayanam\) of those who have already been offered:

**PS 18.77.5**

ŚS 18.4.15

agnír hótāadhvaryúṣ ṭe bŕ̥haspátir

Agni shall be the Hotar, Br̥haspati your Adhvaryu, Indra the Brahmin on your right 

\[side\]. This offered sacrifice, being completed, shall go where **the earlier** **track **of those offered is. 

The second path \( panthā vitaraḥ\) does not seem to be identical with this first track of those who have been offered. This difference is also described at RV 10.18.1ab: páram mr̥tyo ánu párehi pánthāṁ’ yás te svá ítaro devayā́nāt “Depart, Death, along the further path, which is your own, different from the one leading to the gods” 

\(translation by Jamison & Brereton 2014: 1400\). We may conclude from this that the dead person has to take two paths: an initial path into the earth and a second one to the sky leading to the gods. From the perspective of full cremation, the PS 

text is somewhat irritating. How can there be a second path to the sky that follows an earlier path when there was full cremation and immersion of the ashes? The 

earlier path seems to be related to the pūrvam aparaṁ niyānam ‘the front entrance in the west’ that is described at PS 18.80.4 \(see §2.7. below\). 

**2.3  Heaving up the earth as if to heaven: **

**uttabhnuvan pr̥thivīṁ dyām ivopari**** **

In the apūpavān  verses \(see Table 1b above\), there is one part of the refrain that is only found in the PS text, viz. PS 18.77.6b–78.5b uttabhnuvan pr̥thivīṁ dyām ivopari \(i.e. 

the participle of the class V. present of út \+ √ stambh- ‘uphold, support’\). The syntagm uttabhnuvan pr̥thivīm is paralleled by út te stabhnāmi pr̥thivī́m at RV 10.18.12a: RV 10.18.10–14 úpa sarpa mātáram bhū́mim etā́m uruvyácasam pr̥thivī́ṁ suśévām | ū́rṇamradā yuvatír dákṣiṇāvata **eṣā́** **tvā pātu nírr̥ter upásthāt** ‖10‖ **úc chvañcasva pr̥thivi** mā́

Become easy to approach for him, easy to curl up in. Like a mother her son with her hem, cover him, Earth. 12. **Let the earth stay arching up**.

What is described at PS 18.77.6–78.7 thus belongs to what is said in RV 10.18, which is a description of a tumulus burial, where 10d tvā pātu nírr̥ter upásthāt shows that the idea of uttabhnuvan pr̥thivīṁ dyām ivopari is to keep the dead person safe from complete dissolution \( nírr̥ti-\). The earth is further invoked to **arch up** \( út \+ √śvañc-\) at 11a, and it is invoked to keep standing in this position with a thousand house posts fixed \(stanza 12\). Stanza 13 mentions a pillar \( sthū́ṇā-\) that the fathers shall uphold and make stand firm. This text quite literally describes the heaping up of a bulging mound grave \(see Anthony 2007: 409\).6 As mentioned, the PS passage can 

be connected with the interment of the bone-relics. When taken literally, repeated formulae like ‘the one rich in cake, rich in milk, the dish shall sit down here’ look as if they describe burial gifts \(viz. the viaticum\) intended for the dead, which are rich in cake and kṣīravān, drapsavān, ghr̥tavān, māṁsavān, madhuvān, annavān, rasavān, ūrjāvan \(the latter deviating from the strange ápavān at ŚS 18.4.24a\).

This formula is repeated eight more times at PS 18.77.7–78.5. 

**6** “The parallels include a reference in RV 10.18 to a kurgan . . ., a roofed burial chamber supported with posts . . ., and with shored walls . . . This is a precise description of Sintashta and Potapov-ka-Filatovka grave pits, which had wooden plank roofs supported by timber posts and plank shor-ing walls” \(Anthony 2007: 409\).

**2.4 It is a container from clay with four caves**

At PS 18.78.10, a well \( útsa- m.\) is described as a kalaśa- ‘jar, pot, round container’ 

made of clay \( \+mr̥dāṁ\) that is caturbilam “with four orifices” \(Whitney 1905: 878\). 

It does not have just one opening as would a cinerary urn. While the meaning 

‘hole’ is younger, bíla- n. actually means ‘pit, cave’ in the Rigveda \(Mayrhofer 1996: 225: “Höhle, Grube”, Grassmann 1875, 906: “Höhle”, see RV 1.11.5ab valásya 

. . . bílam ‘Vala’s cave’, also in RV 2.12.3\). We can conclude that the meaning of cáturbila- is not necessarily ‘with four openings’ here. If the meaning is still the same as in the RV, the container has rather four pits or four caves in it. Note that a kaláśam  is níkhātam ‘dug in’ in RV 1.117.12cd híraṇyasyeva kaláśaṁ níkhātam úd ūpathur daśamé aśvinā́han “you dug out the one who was buried like a tub of gold on the tenth day, O Aśvins” \(Jamison & Brereton 2014: 273\). In that hymn, the Aśvins rescue those who have been níkhāta- ‘dug in’ \(“buried”\) in one form or another. In my interpretation, the lower part of the kalaśam  is ‘dug in’ \(into the earth\) as well.

A variant of the first hemistich is also found at TB 3.7.4.16 \(and elsewhere\): útsaṁ 

duhanti kaláśaṁ cáturbilam íḍāṁ devī́ṁ mádhumatīm̐ suvarvídam, thus with utsam \(= PS vs. ŚS kóśam ‘receptacle, box’\) in a and with íḍām \(= ŚS, see below\) in b. In place of the latter, Bhattacharya \(2011: 1390\) prints mr̥ḍāṁ, which apparently is the reading of his manuscripts, whereas JM4 has marṛā\(ṁ?\). I tentatively emend this word to \+ mr̥dāṁ, which can be supported by the observation that ma- < mr̥- is similar to the phonetic development reflected by Middle Indic, cf. Pali maga- ‘animal’ < mr̥gá- m. ‘wild animal, deer’ etc. For the younger retroflex cf. also Prakrit maḍak-kiyā- f. ‘earthen jarʼ < \*mr̥d-. This mr̥dā-  f. is also attested in the Upaniṣads and 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **139**

appears to be a younger substitute of earlier mŕ̥d- f. ‘earth, clay’. This substitution is straighforward – unlike that of mr̥ḍa- for RV mr̥ḍayā́ku-.  7

The PS-description seems to be that of a house of clay that nobody wants to 

enter too soon, as confirmed by RV 7.89.1 mó ṣú varuṇa mṛnmáyaṃ gṛháṃ rājann aháṃ gamam ... mṝḷáya ‘King Varuṇa, let me not go to the house of clay\! ... Be merciful\!’, where mr̥nmáyaṁ gr̥hám has been interpreted as referring to a grave or to an urn \(e.g. by Geldner 1951b: 269, fn.\), although the RV-text clearly says that it is a 

‘house’. In the PS stanza, the form \+ mr̥dām  is found in a series of accusative forms \( utsam, kalaśaṁ caturbilaṁ, dhenum madhumatīm\) and the ŚS parallel also has an accusative singular feminine form \( íḍām\) in the relevant place. Therefore, \+ mr̥dām is rather not a genitive plural. 

**2.5 Grains grow on it and shall stand up**

Stanza PS 18.78.7 gives a description of the scattering of grains, which are mixed with sesame.8 Grains naturally grow on the earth and stand up, but not on a dead 

body that has been cremated.

**7** Reading mr̥ḍāṁ  as acc. sg. f. of an adj. mr̥ḍa- \( mr̥ḍāṁ dhenuṁ “merciful milch cow”?\) is not un-problematic because this is first attested in the Black Yajurveda at KS 37.13: 93.19, 14: 94.20\) mr̥ḍo 

’si mr̥ḍase, where the coinage of mr̥ḍa-  is motivated by the following 2sg pres. ind. mid. mr̥ḍase \(Wackernagel & Debrunner 1954: 76\). If the PS mantra is earlier than the Yajurvedic prose, and if mr̥ḍa-  did not exist, the emendation to ‘clay’ will be necessary. The fact that the parallel ŚS íḍāṁ 

f. is not an adjective speaks for a noun in the PS. I doubt that the image depicted in the PS is that of the sun as an udder with four teats, milking Soma. As indicated by ŚS a kóśaṁ and b íḍāṁ, this may hold for the ŚS if describing the cooling ceremony following the cremation. I am grateful to the second anonymous reviewer for pointing me to that interpretation. In my view, however, the use of different words points to a difference between what is described in the ŚS vs the PS. 

**8** For tilamiśrāḥ  see Caland \(1896: 34\): “Im ritual des anāhitāgni’s der Rāṇāyanīyas, Bandhāyanīyas-an, Āśvalāyanīyas \[. . .\] und nach dem Vaikh. sūtra wird in drei gruben oder an drei stellen des zu-bereiteten bodens \[. . .\] sesamwasser oder sesamkörner ausgeschüttet, . . . Die übrigen sesamkörner werden nach links herumgestreut. Wenn jetzt noch in der mitte der geweihten stelle ein stückchen gold niedergelegt ist, wird sie mit gräsern, deren spitzen südlich zu legen sind, überstreut.”

The grains that I scatter on you, mixed with sesame, rich in svadhā, shall be abundant \( vibhvīḥ\), standing ahead \(or ‘mighty’, prabhvīḥ\). May the king approve those for you, may Yama \[approve\] the imperishable, the greater one. 

JM4 reads santu vibhvavī tās te in line cd. The emendation \+ bhūyāṁsam is proposed by Bhattacharya \(2011: 1389\) for Mā bhūyāsaṁ \(= JM4\) and Ja bhūyasaṁ – it is obviously inspired by bhū́yasīm of the ŚS version. In ŚS 18.3.69d, 18.4.26d, and 18.4.43d, the meter suggests that the word yamó has been secondarily inserted. In the PS 

version, however, Yama \( yamaḥ in e\) is separated from the word rājā ‘king’, which might be understood as indication that there was a different, human king involved in the ritual in the PS version. Moreover, akṣitaṁ bhūyāṁsam  is accusative and thus cannot refer to Yama here. Instead, it might perhaps refer to the dead man, 

who, in my interpretation, is also imperishable and greater than a normal person, sitting in his cave, covered and surrounded by a huge, imperishable mound. Under 

this assumption, a human king might be present the PS text, put in his grave. The entity addressed with the pronoun te in d could be the mound and it would be Yama who bestows the grains upon the dead king \(speaking in the first person: ‘I scatter’\). 

This reading seems to have been changed to another sense in the ŚS parallel, where the king is Yama himself and there is neither another king other than Yama, nor a grave-mound. Grains are also mentioned in the following two stanzas, PS 18.79.2–3: **PS 18.79.2**

ŚS 18.4.32

Grains \[are what\] the milch cow becomes, her calf becomes sesame. On her subsist

In place of Bhattacharya’s \(2011: 1390\) bhavad in pāda a, JM4 has abhavad, which agrees with the ŚS parallel. Instead of his tāṁ  in pāda c, JM4 and Mā have  tā. The nominative plural dhānāḥ cannot be the subject to the singular verb \(a\)bhavat, as Whitney’s \(1905: 879\) translation implies: “the grains became a milch-cow”. In my syntactic analysis,9 dhenuḥ is the subject to bhavat. In my interpretation, the dead king is identified as a milch cow that provides the sweet grasses that really grow on **9** I think that dhānā dhenur bhavad is a focus construction with ‘grains’ in clause-initial focus position. See further Delbrück \(1888: 17, §8\); Amano \(2009: 47–48\). 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **141**

the mound, out of the grave-mound of the dead king. The picture described here is that of a milch cow, living in Yama’s realm \(Yama’s dungeon, see §2.8. below\). 

At PS 18.79.3d I understand upa tiṣṭhantu tvā as ‘\[that grains\] shall stand up to you’ \(i.e. ‘grow’\):

That grains of yours, O you, the one beyond, shall become wish-milking – the 

piebald, reddish-white ones, of different form, of like form, with \[their\] sesame-calf, **shall stand up to you then**. 

In pāda a, the dead man is invoked as ‘that one, the one beyond’, at least if we assign the pronoun amú- its distal deictic value and not its function as placeholder for a name as do Weber \(1896: 284: “o NN”\) and Whitney \(1905: 879; “O so-and-so”\). Instead of PS dhānāḥ ‘grains’, the ŚS version has dhenávaḥ ‘milch cows’, which fits the meter better. At the end of the stanza, ŚS has the adverb átra ‘there’, whereas the PS seems to have a temporal āt ‘then’. To sum up, I argue here that the scattering of the grains is more symbolic in the ritual of the Śaunakins, whereas in the ritual of the Paippalādins, the seed is actually sown to make sweet grass grow on the grave-mound. 

**2.6 It is made as big as his kinship**

Roland A. Pooth

Bhattacharya’s \(2011: 1391\) emendation \+ utsaṁ for vatsaṁ of the manuscripts \(including JM4\) is taken from the ŚS version. 

The next stanza asks people referred to with sajātāḥ ‘kinsmen’, probably the bereaved family, to make the world for him **as big as his kinship** \( yāvatsabandhu\). 

Although the dictionaries give “a heap of wood \(?\)” \(Monier-Williams1899: 266a\), 

the meaning of kásāmbu- is unknown. Weber \(1896: 285\) vacillates between “Holzs-toss” \(‘woodpile’\) and “Knochenhaufen” \(‘pile of bones’\). 

**PS 18.79.7**

This kasāmbu is piled by piling. Kinsmen, look down upon it, come here\! The mortal one goes to non-death, to immortality. For him make the world as big as his kinship\! 

In place of \+ cayanena the manuscripts have vayanena. The emendation \+ citaṁ 

‘piled’ is analogous to PS 18.77.4a \(see above\). And for the correction in pāda c see Bhattacharya \(2011: xciii\). As for b, Whitney \(1905: 881\) mentions that “the comm. 

says that either the relatives or all are to look at them as deposited in the hollow, while the manager recites the verse”. Lanman adds that “the verse, with its cayanena citam and gr̥hā́n \[. . .\] seems clearly to refer to** a grave-mound**; but the ritual use, with its trench, is in **flat contradiction** with such reference” \(emphasis mine\). 

This is in agreement with my interpretation of the imitation of the worlds \(see §2.1. 

above\) as referring to such a grave-mound. If we thus take the imitation of the 

worlds \(§2.1\) as referring to such a grave-mound, the PS text fits the descriptions as interpreted here so that there is no contradiction any longer. 

**2.7  The container has a front entrance **

**in the west**

Weber \(1896: 287\) writes that ŚS 18.4.44 \(= PS 18.80.4\) is addressed to the dead, be it on the pyre, be it in the tomb \(“. . .sei es auf dem rogus, sei es in der Gruft”\). It is possible to understand the word ápara- here as ‘western’, so that the dead fathers 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **143**

would have entered the grave in the west. This approach seems attractive to me 

because the Andronovans oriented their graves to the west or south-west, i.e. the direction of the setting sun \(see Kuz’mina 2007: 192\). 

**PS 18.80.4**

In pāda c, I read \+abhiṣāco as proposed by Bhattacharya \(2011: 1393: abhiśā\( <ṣā\) co\). 

The following stanza clearly refers to a burial \(see Weber 1896: 287: “bei der Beerdi-gung, nicht bei der Verbrennung”\):

Pāda b of the PS version \(JM4 has savitāẏāyuḥ\) is difficult to make sense of and it is probably just a corruption of what is preserved in the ŚS parallel, i.e. the result of a perseveration from PS 18.4.2d \( asmai vo dhātā savitā suvāti\). In pāda c Bhattacharya \(2011: 1394\) prints parāpurī\(<rai\)tā \(JM4 has  parāpurītā\). I tentatively adopt his suggestion \+ parāpuraitā, although the sense and morphology of this word remain vague. There is a good chance that párāparaitā as found in the ŚS version is meant here, i.e. a nomen agentis with iterated preverb: ‘one who goes repeatedly away’ 

\(see Tichy 1995: 79 and 265\).

In PS 18.81.2, the text says that certain people ‘scattered’ or ‘heaped up’ \(√ vap-\) a mansion or **a dungeon** \( harmyá-\) for Yama and the speaker asserts that he now follows this example. PS \+vapāmi  is an emendation \(= ŚS\). Bhattacharya \(2011: 1396\) prints vapāpāmi \(vapāmi?\), while JM4 has vapaṣāmi.

Further evidence of a **fortified house** with good fences can be found in other Vedic texts as well. The hymn RV 10.15 addresses the forefathers \( pitáraḥ\), who have gone to eternal life \(1c ásuṁ yá īyúḥ\). Crucially, two types of forefathers are distinguished. The first mentioned are the ones set down in the rájas-. Second come those who are now in suvr̥jánāsu vikṣú.

The places where the forefathers are buried are described in the PS and ŚS ver-

sions using the locative dikṣú instead of RV vikṣú. PS \+niṣattā is an emendation for Odisha niṣaktā, Kashmir niṣatā \(see Zehnder 1999: 85\). Jamison & Brereton \(2014: 1393\) translate the RV version as follows: “Let this homage here today be 

for the forefathers – those who went previously, those who went later, those who 

are seated here in the earthly realm, or **who are now among the clans of good **

**community**”. 

However, the noun phrase pā́rthive rájasi may refer to the earthly ‘dust, darkness’, which is one of the meanings of rájas- n. \(see Mayrhofer 1996: 426\). In the context of a funeral, this seems to refer to a grave. The burial is contrasted with ye vā nūnaṁ **suvr̥janāsu dikṣu**.  I understand suvr̥jana- as ‘of good territory’ in the sense of ‘well-enclosed, well-fenced’ \(the etymology points to ‘fence, enclose’, see Mayrhofer 1996: 573\). The AV text makes a contrast in line cd between yé pā́rthive rájasy ā́ \+níṣattā vs . yé vā nūnáṁ suvr̥jánāsu dikṣú, that is, between the ones buried in the rájas- and those who were buried, but presumably not regularly buried. This contrast is indicated by the particle vā ‘or else’. Whereas the RV has vikṣú, both AV 

recensions seem to have dikṣú.10 We can hypothesize that there were two types of burials \(i.e. regular burials in the earth and outstanding burials in suvr̥janāsu dikṣu\) and there were two ways to bury the dead in Rigvedic and Atharvavedic times, or before. Some were put into a grave \(after some, but not all, of their body parts were burnt\), while the more important people received special treatment 

\(were buried in a grave-mound\). Cf. Oberlies \(1998: 300 with fn. 727 and §1.6.3.6\) on different forms of burial rites practised side by side. 

**10** In my interpretation, dikṣú need not necessarily belong to díś- f. ‘direction, region’, but may, alternatively, be interpreted as the locative plural of the otherwise unattested root noun díh- f. 

‘mound’ \(German ‘Aufschüttung, Wall’; from PIE \*dʰei̯ǵʰ- ‘smear, form, build’, see Mayrhofer 1992, 746\), similar in meaning to RV 1.51.9d saṁ-díh- f. ‘wall’. One expects older dikṣú and younger 

\*dhikṣú \(cf. the sa- aorist JB 3.121 adhikṣan\). The noun phrase suvr̥jánāsu dikṣú ‘well-territoried díhas’ could then, perhaps, refer to such a mound the earth of which is surrounded by good walls and is well-marked-out, i.e. a tumulus grave with its surrounding territory \(wall, fence\). 

The RV, as well as Kashmirian PS manuscript \(at PS 2.30.3c\) and one ŚS manuscript \(see Whitney 1905: 826\) have vikṣú instead of dikṣú, which can be understood as ‘among the clans, among the settlements’.

Come here, fathers, soma-loving ones, by deep fatherly roads, supplying us with 

progeny and richness, \[in order to attain\] longevity, a hundred autumns. 

This stanza conforms to my hypothesis that the most important dead, before they 

reach their position in the sky, are locked up in a mound under a sky-stone, with the mound functioning as a well \(spring, fountain\) that can be milked for the descendants before the man comes out as celestial sons after sixty autumns. Can we find 

more about the fathers’ roads and afterlife? The visions of the Vedic poets include the mythical idea that, like their fathers, they want to become divás putrā́ḥ ‘sons of heaven’:

**áṅgiraso bhavemā́driṁ rujema** dhanínaṁ śucántaḥ ‖ ‘So then, as the seven first poets, trembling \[in inspiration\], **may we be born **from mother Dawn, **as \[to\] the ritual-arranging men**. **May we become sons of heaven**, Aṅgirases. **May we break the stone** that holds the prize, as we blaze.’ RV 4.2.16  ádhā **yáthā naḥ pitáraḥ párāsaḥ** ‘ pratnā́so agna r̥tám āśuṣāṇā́ḥ | śúcī́d ayan dī́dhitim ukthaśā́saḥ ‘ **kṣā́mā bhindánto aruṇī́r ápa vran** ‖ “Then **like our further forefathers of old**, panting over the truth, o Agni, those reciting solemn speech \(now\) will come to the blazing \(udder of sacrifice \[= Vala\]\), to visionary power. **Splitting \(heaven and\) earth, they \(will\) unclose the ruddy \(cows \[= dawns\]\)**” \(translation by Jamison & Brereton 2014: 560\). 

The relevant parts of RV 4.2.15 and 16 are highlighted here in bold type. It is clear from what is described in the text that the celestial sons are poetically envisioned as the ones who are splitting up \(the darkness, támas-\) into heaven and earth. They strive to break the stone-sky \( ádriṁ rujema\) in order to uncover the lights of the dawns \(the daughters of heaven\) like the sun-god \( sū́rya-\) regularly does, who is made to dispel the darkness \(see e.g. RV 4.13.3ab\). 

RV 4.2.16a and d: ádhā yáthā naḥ pitáraḥ . . . kṣā́mā bhindánto aruṇī́r ápa vran thus reveals that the forefathers are also splitting up the darkness. RV 4.2.15b says that the reciters strive to follow their model by letting themselves be born as \(and 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **147**

to\) those men that split up the darkness before. The fathers thus split up the sky as if they were Indra and as if the sky was Vala, thereby opening up the sky for the ruddy ones \(= the dawnlights\). We can conclude that **the dead person, trapped in** **the well, **will finally follow their model and do the same thing. The stanza RV 4.2.16 

is also found at VSM 19.69 \(= VSK 21.1.69\) and TS 2.6.12.4, as exact parallels. The AV 

has the following versions, which I contrast again:

**PS 18.70.8**

ŚS 18.3.21

adhā yathā naḥ pitaraḥ parāsaḥ

ádhā yáthā naḥ pitáraḥ párāsaḥ

So then **as our distant fathers**, the ones that were there before, O Agni, who have blown on to here \( ā \+ śvas-\) the cosmic-ritual order, they \(shall\) go truly gleamingly \(viz. as stars in the sky\), reciting the vision, **splitting up the two grounds** \(= heaven and earth\), they \(shall\) uncover the ruddy ones. 

In c, Bhattacharya \(2011: 1370\) emends the readings Ja dīdhatim and Mā tīdhitam to \+dīdhitim. In d, he prints bruvan, which I emend to \+ vran following the ŚS 

version. Should we, perhaps, also emend ŚS āśaśānā́ḥ to āśuṣāṇāḥ and dī́dhyataḥ 

to \+dīdhitim \(= PS, RV\)? Or is there a different meaning in these deviations? I must leave this issue aside here. Jamison \(Jamison & Brereton 2014ff. at RV 4.1.13\) translates the phrase r̥tám āśuṣāṇā́ḥ  with “panting over the truth” and suggests that it expresses the energy and effort of the Aṅgirases, but to my mind it can describe the way the ancient visionary poets blew on the cosmic order \(like a fire\) and thereby established the order of the ritual by their visionary desire and libido, as described in the hymn RV 10.129. I also think that dīdhitim ukthaśāsaḥ  can be understood as 

‘reciting the vision’. For a possible interpretation of the form ayan as injunctive see Jamison & Brereton \(2014ff. at RV 4.2.16\). As I discuss in detail in Pooth \(2019\), there are stems like áya- and śáya- that cannot solely be analyzed as subjunctives, but have a status in between subjunctive and present injunctive forms of the first present class. Jamison suggests that we should understand the dual as elliptic: 

“splitting \(heaven and\) earth”. She also says: “. . . would refer to the visual experience of dawn, when the appearance of the
dawn light at the horizon seems to split sky from earth, allowing the light to flood in through the resulting slit” \(Jamison & Brereton 2014ff. at RV 4.2.16\). In my interpretation, this is what would also be the description of the dead man leaving his grave by the eastern exit, as if going through the slit resulting from the splitting of the darkness into the open space facing the sun, moving like the rising sun. Thus, RV 4.2.15d kṣā́mā bhindántaḥ ‘splitting \(it\) 

**148** 

Roland A. Pooth

in two earths, splitting the two earths’ is referring to the same mythical idea as RV 

4.13.3a támase vipŕ̥ce ‘for dividing the darkness’. By splitting the darkness in order to provide the spheres/worlds, like Sūrya, the forefathers thus ‘uncover the ruddy ones \(sc. the dawns\)’ \( aruṇī́r ápa vran\). To conclude, the sons of heaven, the forefathers who have become celestial sons, are envisioned as splitting up the earth to uncover \(and release\) the daughter\(s\) of heaven, that is, the dawns \(as Sūrya regularly does, and as Indra did to the Vala\). It follows from this mythical idea that this is the reason why the forefathers are also envisioned as sitting in the womb or lap of the dawns \( ā́sīnāso aruṣī́nām upásthe\). This is explicitly described at RV 10.15.7: RV 10.15.7 ** ā́sīnāso aruṇī́nām** upásthe rayíṁ dhatta dāśúṣe mártyāya | putrébhyaḥ pitaras tásya vásvaḥ prá yachata tá ihórjaṁ dadhāta ‖ ‘**Sitting in the lap of the ruddy ones**, grant wealth to the pious mortal\! Hand over \[some\] of that wealth to your sons, fathers, grant \[us\] 

power here\!’

We can interpret this as follows. The sun is envisioned as growing out of the lap of the dawns and thus the ruddy ones \(the ruddy cows\) like Agni grows out of the lap of the dawns and out of the lap of his two mothers \(i.e. two pieces of fire wood\). RV 

10.15.11 refers to the forefathers who were burnt \(that is, ágniṣvāttāḥ ‘sweetened by the fire’\). 

RV 10.15.11 ágniṣvāttāḥ pitara ehá gachata sádaḥsadaḥ sadata supraṇītayaḥ | attā́ havī́ṁṣi práyatāni barhíṣy áthā rayíṁ sárvavīraṁ dadhātana ‖ ‘Sweetened by the fire, fathers, come here. Sit in each of your own seats, you of good guidance. Eat the oblations set forth on the ritual grass. Then grant wealth that includes all men\!’

According to the context, the \(dead\) forefathers are sitting \(i.e. are buried\) on something reddish. Another hypothesis that immediately comes to mind when looking at 

the archeological evidence is the following. It is at least possible that this mythical idea of sitting in the womb or lap of the dawns is an echo of an old funeral ritual of the past. I suggest that we connect it to the use of something **actually reddish** at the burial performance – not just as a spoken textual metaphor. From the perspective of the archeological evidence, the mythical picture of the dead forefather’s sitting on the ruddy ones might be a relic of the strewing of **reddish ochre** within the burial ritual. However, this does not necessarily imply that the ochre was also used later. It is only implied that the picture of the fathers “sitting in the lap of the dawns” might have something to do with this matter on a diachronic mythological 

and diachronic metaphorical level. According to the metaphorical visions of the 

Vedic poets described above, this sitting in the womb or lap of the dawns must 

have enabled the dead forefathers to split up the earth \(as the dawns do and as 

Sūrya does, and as Indra did\) to prolong their life to a ‘hundred autumns’ and to become sons of heaven \( divás putrā́ḥ\). This idea is further strengthened by the fact 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **149**

that the dawn is named as ‘prolonging our life’, for example, at RV 7.77.5b: úṣo devi pratirántī na ā́yuḥ ‘O Uṣas, O goddess, prolonging our life’. Parallels are ‘the Uṣas brings new life’ at RV 7.80.2, ‘the Uṣas brings sun’ at RV 5.80.1, ‘the Uṣas lets us see the sunlight’ at RV 7.81.4, etc. The strewing of reddish ochre, therefore, might have symbolized the fires of the dawn in prehistoric times, which enable and/or assist the dead person to split up the earth again and go to eternal life. In other words, the strewing of reddish ochre once – not necessarily at the time of the composition of the text \(as said\), but before that period – symbolized preservation of life or fulfillment, and the fixing, adjustment and repairing of the dead body as a celestial son. Many researchers have similarly emphasized the symbolic meanings of the 

colour red, as expressed in the context of burial. The use of red ochre in burials has related to the concept of death and to the preservation of the energy of life, providing magical force for the route to the world beyond \(see Bower 2003: 277, 

Vianello 2004\). In this context, PS 18.76.3cd is of special interest, not only because pāda c occurs in the PS only, but also because the dead is addressed to step on the surface of the ruddy one. The bradhnásya viṣṭáp- must be Agni’s surface and at the same time the one of the lights of the dawn. 

**PS 18.76.3cd**

bradhnasya viṣṭapy adhi vi kramasva 11

yatrādityā amr̥tam īkṣayanti ‖ 11

**Step onto the surface of the ruddy one** to where the Ādityas make the immortal see \(i.e. see the sun\). 

**2.10 The fathers are coming again in a month**

The following stanza is reminiscent of the re-opening of a grave after a month:

**PS 18.81.9**

ŚS 18.4.63

parā yāta pitaraḥ somiyāso 11

párā yāta pitaraḥ somyā́so

ádhā māsi púnar ā́ yāta no gr̥hā́n

Go away, fathers, Soma-loving, by deep roads traveled by \[your\] fathers\! **Then, in** **a month, come to our house again** in order to consume the libation, with good progeny, all men together\! 

**150** 

Roland A. Pooth

The house is in the singular in the PS \( gr̥ham\), whereas the ŚS parallel has the plural gr̥hā́n. If we assume that a mound is being spoken of here, a fortified house as it were, the singular makes perfect sense. At the beginning of pāda d manuscripts Ja and JM4 have haviratnaṁ, whereas Bhattacharya \(2011: 1397\) edits havirannaṁ, apparently following Mā. One might, perhaps, think of a conjecture \+ havīratnaṁ 

\(i.e. haviḥ-ratna- in sandhi\). However, ‘libation-treasure’ hardly makes sense, and it is more likely that the PS tradition suffered a corruption of the expression of purpose áttum ‘in order to eat’ that is found in the ŚS version. As Whitney \(1905: 889\) notes, many ŚS manuscripts also have difficulty over this word, reading 

annum, atnum, antum and the like instead. It is tempting to understand this stanza as a description of relatives returning to the grave a month after the burial.11 The next PS stanza describes the fathers as going away again. Pāda d is not found in the ŚS and RV \(RV 1.82.2\) parallels. 

**PS 18.81.10**

ŚS 18.4.61

They have eaten, they have exhilarated themselves, they have shaken off their dear ones. The self-radiant ones have been praised. **Go away**, fathers, \[back\] **to the **\(i.e. 

your\)** houses**\! 

The order of the fathers’ movements is PS 18.81.8a ā yāta pitaraḥ \(= ŚS 18.4.62a\), followed by PS 18.81.9a parā yāta pitaraḥ \(= ŚS 18.4.63a\). Thus, they shall come first, then they shall go and come again, and finally they shall return to their houses/

homes. This order of the fathers’ appearances is thus different from the ŚS text, where they shall only come \(ŚS 18.4.62a\) and go away \(ŚS 18.4.63a\). My interpretation of this difference is that the relatives return to the mound after a month in the PS ceremony, described in the PS text by the returning of the fathers after a month. 

The PS text may thus reveal a reopening of the grave after a month, whereas there **11** Compare in this context the burial practices of the Cemetery H culture, NW India, 1900–1300 

BC: “Almost all of the graves had been re-opened shortly after burial, as demonstrated by the permanence of some of the weakest skeletal joints in burials that had been re-opened to place pots on the hands and knees of the deceased . . . or to remove and displace, to various degrees, the bones . . . It is now clear that many ceramic assemblages, previously mapped as synchronous deposits, are not necessarily such and probably do not simply reflect the original grave goods, but represent a pal-impsest of offerings and removals as parts of longer funerary cycles, often including exhumation” 

\(Vidale & Micheli 2017: 396, italics mine\). 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **151**

is nothing analogous in the ŚS text, where the coming and going of the fathers does not describe any returning to the grave. Notably, in the PS stanza following the 

fathers’ part, the limbs that might have been left \(forgotten\) are made to **enter** **again**, in contrast to the ŚS text, where the speaker makes them swell \(i.e. repairs them\) instead:

**PS 18.82.1**

ŚS 18.4.64

yad vo agnir ajahād ekam aṅgaṁ

11

yád vo agnír ájahād ékam áṅgaṁ

The one limb of you that Agni Jātavedas left when making you go to the fathers’ 

world, that same \[limb\] **I make enter **again for you. Exhilarated yourselves, fathers, all of you, with your limbs intact\! 

Bhattacharya \(2011: 1398\) prints \*tad at the beginning of pāda c, adopting the metrically impeccable ŚS variant. However, the manuscripts \(Ja, Mā, JM4\) read 

etad here. I would argue that the use of different verbs in PS \( ā veśayāmi\) vs. ŚS 

\( ā́ pyāyayāmi\) is not accidental. When seen from the Kurgan perspective outlined here, the forgotten limb **is made to enter** the mound, whereas it does not enter a mound in the ŚS parallel. 

**2.11 Cover him, O Earth**

Next comes the only stanza of the 13th anuvāka with just three pādas. The earth is now invoked to cover the dead man. The unique three-pāda pattern suggests that 

this stanza marks a special moment in the funeral ceremony. I think this might be the moment the dead man is locked in. 

**PS 18.82.2**

ŚS 18.4.66

Hey you, the one beyond, your mind is here. Like the siblings \[cover\] the kaputsalam, **cover him, O Earth\! **

**152** 

Roland A. Pooth

The emendation to the vocative ŚS \+ásau \(for asáu of all manuscripts\) is already suggested by Sāyaṇa \( pretasya saṁbodhanam\). It could also be understood as placeholder for a name \(‘O N.N.’; see PS 18.79.3a above\). The meanings of the word kaputsala- ~ kapúcchala- n. found in the dictionaries are “tuft of hair on the hind part of the head \(hanging down like a tail\)” and “the fore-part of a sacrificial ladle” 

\(Monier-Williams 1899, 251b\). A possible etymological analysis \( ka-púcchala-\) would result in ‘awful \(or awesome\) little tail’ \(see Mayrhofer 1992: 302\). What this means in the present simile and how it relates to kákutsalam of the ŚS version is not immediately apparent.12

**2.12 Be calm, don’t be afraid in this cowshed**

In the PS version, three stanzas follow which are also found in the Kauśikasūtra 

with some variations \(see Griffiths 2004: 80–81, who provides an edition of PS 

18.82.3–5\). Here, the dead fathers are addressed again. They are told not to be 

afraid in this cowshed. 

**PS 18.82.3 **= KauśS 89.12

\(ŚS 7.60.1d\)

**Be calm, don’t be afraid**, full of dung** in this cowshed**. Giving nourishment, well-doers, having pure commandments, . . . \( gr̥hā or gr̥hāḥ\) alive may we reverently approach you. 

The form gr̥hā \(i.e. gr̥hā or gr̥hāḥ\) in pāda d is difficult to interpret in the present context, and, since it is also found in the Kauśikasūtra, it cannot be dismissed easily as a recent error of transmission \(cf. e.g. PS 19.52.9c jyog jīvanta upa tvā sadema\). 

If it is nominative plural \( gr̥hāḥ\), one could refer to RV 10.119.13a: gr̥hó yāmy áraṁkr̥taḥ “As a household that is properly equipped, I journey . . .” \(translation by Jamison & Brereton 2014: 1590\). Or is it vocative: ‘O houses’? Or one might consider **12** If kaputsalam  refers to the hollow part of a sacrificial spoon, the comparison might run as follows: The waters and the milk \(i.e. the siblings\) cover the hollow of the spoon like the earth covers the hollow of the burial mound. 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **153**

that gr̥há- is a neuter noun here \(see e.g. AVPariś. 55.6.3 gr̥hāṇi\), which would result in ‘may we . . . approach your houses’. 

In my tentative interpretation, the cowshed might be identified as the mound, 

whose inside can be truly terrifying, because it is Yama’s dungeon.13 The reciter must thus pacify the relatives going down again by saying: “don’t be afraid”. Here, the dead is identified as a milch cow again \(as at PS 18.79.2 above\) that is now in her cowshed \(that is, his grave-mound\). 

**2.13  The dead man is like Trita trapped **

**in the well**

The fact that stanza RV 1.105.1 serves as the conclusion of the AV funeral hymns is judged by Whitney \(1905: 894\) to be very obscure. I think that my interpretation 

can solve this mystery. 

**PS 18.82.10**

ŚS 18.4.89

The moon runs among the waters, the eagle \[runs\] in the sky. Don’t they \(i.e., the poets\) find your track, O golden-rimmed lightning bolts? Be cognizant of this of 

mine, O world-halves\! 

According to Sāyaṇa \(at RV 1.105.1 and at ŚS 18.4.89\), this stanza belongs to the myth of the R̥ṣis Ekata, Dvita and Trita, who found a well \(or tank: kūpa-\).14 Trita, drawing water, was pushed down by the other two**, and he was trapped in the well**, where he composed a hymn to the gods, and miraculously managed to prepare the sacrificial soma \(see RV 9.34.4\). In this myth, Trita, when locked in the well, begs aid from the gods. Thus, in this final stanza of PS 18 \(and of ŚS 18\), we may interpret **13** This view does not necessarily presuppose that goṣṭhá-  must denote a closed cowshed, but not an open, unroofed pen \(as one would normally assume for Vedic times\), because the actual form of the cowshed is irrelevant for such a poetic metaphor. The relevant part of the metaphor is that it is the place where the cow or the cows are locked in. 

**14** For a detailed discussion of this story see Bigger \(1994\). 

**154** 

Roland A. Pooth

the well described in the funeral ritual as having something to do with a person 

being trapped in a well before he miraculously manages to become a celestial son. 

When seen from the perspective of a burial mound, described as a well, where 

the dead person is trapped, there is a straightforward explanation. Thus, in the 

concluding verse of the funeral chants of the PS, we can finally take the well that is described in the PS text \(see §2.4. above\) as the depth of the earth, where the dead man is trapped as if he was Trita fallen into the well. I think that this can confirm the idea that the dead person was imprisoned in Yama’s dungeon, which was a 

fortified house and thus a burial mound, as claimed here. In my interpretation, the poet finally proudly states that he is known in both world-halves, earth and sky, for finding the path to the gods for the dead. 

**3 Conclusions**

The presented textual evidence suggests that the 13th anuvāka of PS 18 describes 

a funeral ceremony with partial cremation preceding the burial of a corpse of a 

very important man. His body is not completely burnt, rather only parts of it. And finally, he is buried in order to protect him from complete dissolution. We have 

seen that complete cremation was envisioned as leading to complete dissolution 

and would prevent the repairing \(mending\) of the body on its way to becoming 

a son of the sky. The cumulative evidence can be read as describing this practice embedded in the king’s funeral ceremony. If the Paippalādins were royal priests,15 

this important corpse must be the dead king himself \(see §2.5. above\). I consider it possible that the textual differences between the PS and ŚS versions are partly due to changes or different approaches in the funerary ritual of the two Atharvavedic śākhās, especially when it comes to cremation with or without burial and 

a final dispersal of the bone-relics. When interpreted from the perspective of these textual differences, the Śaunakins did not participate in the building of a burial mound and the burial ceremony for a dead king, as are the contents of the respective funeral chants of the Paippalādins \(in the interpretation given here\). Whether the PS passages reflect an ancient tradition is a thrilling question and bears quite important implications.16 The text may either describe an ancient ceremony that 

was still being practiced by the Paippalādins – or their text only preserves what **15** See Kulke & Rothermund \(2004: 5\): “There is much evidence in ancient texts that there were two ideal types of Brahmins in those days, the royal priest or advisor \( rajpurohit,  rajguru\) and the sage \( rishi\) who lived in the forest and shared his wisdom only with those who asked for it.ˮ

**16** On early burial sites and stūpas cf., e.g., Schopen \(1996\). 

The Funeral Ceremony Described in the 13th Anuvāka of the Mahatkāṇḍa **155**

their forefathers once did in the distant past. If it is true that the PS reflects an ancient tradition, the most important forefathers of the Vedic poets and their prehistoric kings were buried in outstanding mounds that were imitations of the uni-

verse. However, I must leave the final judgement on these fascinating questions to future research.
