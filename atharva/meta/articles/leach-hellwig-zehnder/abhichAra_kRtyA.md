**Rites to Subdue: abhicāra**** and kṛtyā**** **

**in the Mahābhārata**

**Abstract:** The influence of Atharvavedic textual communities on the textual history and meaning of the Mahābhārata \(MBh\) is a recurrent topic in epic studies as the 

influential “Bhṛguization theory” proposed by V.S. Sukthankar \(1936\) demonstrates. 

Epic scholars often followed the general view on the Atharvaveda as focusing on 

dubious “magic” rituals and translated passages dealing with Atharvavedic ritual 

practices, such as abhicāra, with “black magic” or “sorcery”. However, a general negative understanding and a too-general application of the terminology of 

“magic” effaces rather than reveals the polyvalent status of these practices in the epic. A closer look at the references to the Atharvaveda and the associated ritual vocabulary calls for more specific translations and points to the contested status of the Atharvaveda in the history of its reception. To demonstrate this, the contested status of ritual practices that aim to subdue others is discussed through an analysis of epic representations of abhicāra and kṛtyā rites which are typically connected to the Atharvaveda. The epic passages attest to the ambiguous status of these practices as they are criticized, but also accepted when employed in domestic contexts and in negotiating gender relations. 

**1 Introduction**

The historical and ideological relationship between the Mahābhārata and the Veda 

is a much-discussed topic in the study of the epic and the reception history of the Veda. Some scholars highlight continuities that can be detected in the Mahābhārata’s references to Vedic rituals and the possible impact of ritual structures on the epic narrative.1 Others suggest that the epic rather negotiates a crisis of Vedic ritualism caused by changing socio-political contexts \(such as the rise of empires, 

increasing social stratification\) and the success of new religious-philosophical doctrines challenging the authority of Brahmanical priests and Vedic texts \(Buddhism, Sāṃkhya, bhakti etc.\).2 The epic provides evidence for both views and this points to the interests of the various textual communities involved in its transmission. The **1** For instance, van Buitenen \(1972\), Minkowski \(1989\).

influence of Atharvavedic textual communities on the textual history of the epic 

has been discussed particularly since Vishnu S. Sukthankar’s \(1936\) “Bhṛguization” 

theory. He argued that the final redaction of the epic is marked by the incorporation of texts featuring the Bhārgavas, the descendants of Bhṛgu, one of the prominent 

representatives of Atharvavedic ritualism \(along with the descendants of Athar-

van and Aṅgiras\). At the same time, Sukthankar doubted the significance of these 

additions to the epic narrative and its ideological message. In his 1956 monograph on the meaning of the Mahābhārata, Sukhtankar argues that the bhakti-doctrine is the epic’s “metaphysical” core message. One reason for the exclusion of the Atharvaveda from ‘meaning-production’ in the epic is that Sukthankar was convinced 

that the Bhārgava material has not the “remotest intrinsic connection” with the 

epic narrative.3 Furthermore, the Atharvaveda’s focus on magic and witchcraft is 

far away from the metaphysics of bhakti.4 His view on the Atharvaveda resonates with its common association with destructive rituals and violent priests. Maurice Bloomfield poignantly summarizes this view as follows: “The enemy and the 

unholy wizard, the uncanny and the demoniacal, are conceptions which constantly 

interlace in the Atharvaveda.”5 Consequently, terms like “black magic”, “sorcery” 

and “witchcraft” are regularly used for Atharvavedic practices. This view has also influenced epic scholarship as the discussion of the “Bhṛguization” theory demonstrates. Furthermore, when the Atharvaveda surfaces in the epic, the Western 

vocabulary of magic \(despite its controversial semantics\) is often used, for instance when abhicāra in the epic is generally translated as “black magic” or “sorcery”. 

In epic studies, this has not necessarily resulted in viewing ‘magic’ as something negative or dubious. One way of dealing with the ‘magical’ elements in the epic is to treat them as literary devices, as typical features of the ‘mythic’ universe depicted in the epic tale. This universe includes miraculous elements, introducing elements of adventure and fairy tale into the ‘heroic’ tale. Accordingly, Atharvavedic “wizards”, and “uncanny” practices like abhicāra have been treated as features of the literary genre.6 On the other hand, such features were also viewed as pointing to the 

epic’s cultural-historical contexts in that they mirror ritual practices in the ‘real’, the extra-diegetic world. According to E. W. Hopkins, for instance, the ubiquity of **3** Sukthankar \(1936–1937: 67\). In his view, the Bhārgavas were responsible for the first part of Book 1 and much of the didactic parts in Books 12 and 13 \(ibid.: 71\). For a discussion of the Bhr-guization theory and for attempts to connect it to the epic plot, see, for instance, Goldmann \(1977\), Hiltebeitel \(1999\), and Bhattacharji \(1991–1992\). 

**4** Sukthankar notes: “The connection of the Bhṛgus with the Atharvaveda explains the element of witchcraft in the Bhārgava legends of our epic” \(1936: 66\). 

**5** Bloomfield \(1890: 340\). 

**6** See, for instance, Hopkins on the “magic lore” \(1910: 25\) included in the epic. 

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **279**

“magic” practices in the epic attests to contemporary ritual practices: “what is formally taught elsewhere is found in the epic in active operation” \(Hopkins 1910: 24\). 

In a similar vein, depictions of Atharvavedic practices can be treated as instances motivating either the propagation or the criticism of dominant ritual and social 

norms. 

Nevertheless, a too general application of the terminology of ‘magic’ – pro-

ducing, for instance, problematic distinctions such as between ‘black’ and ‘white’ 

magic –7 effaces rather than reveals the contested and polyvalent status of these practices. It imposes a second-order discourse that is mostly entertained in the comparative study of religion and has certain advantages for cross-cultural studies.8 

But the application of this discourse must not replace the study of the emic vocabulary for what is typically a large spectrum of practices, nor overrule the findings in the sources which suggest a more complex picture. This complexity is not due 

only to the Sanskrit ritual vocabulary that calls for more specific translations, but also because of the ambiguous position of the Atharvaveda in the history of its 

reception. On the one hand, there is textual evidence for a ‘negative’ view of the Atharvaveda9 that locates it at the margins of the original canon of the three Vedas and its transmission in less respected, even dubious priestly communities. On the other hand, the history of its reception also attests to its success, as can be seen in the very creation of the canon of the four Vedas, the caturveda which is referred to alongside the term trayī \(the three Vedas\) and even came to replace it.10 Furthermore, it enjoys a certain popularity because Atharvaveda rites and mantras cater 

to the worldly needs of householders. The different reactions to the Atharvaveda 

corpus result in its being perceived as both included and excluded, less respect-

able in certain circles, and popular in others. Accordingly, the representation of the Atharvaveda and its priests in the subsequent textual tradition has remained **7** In his study of abhicāra, Türstig \(1985: 71\) rejects this distinction as “totally inapplicable” because “’white magic’ and ‘black magic’ are not seen as functional opposites, but rather as complementary functions related to the ambivalent aspects of one single power.” 

**8** See Otto \(2013\) on the problematics of the term “magic” in the study of religions in general, and Stratton \(2013\) on strategies for combining a philological concern with the emic terminology with a useful employment of the term ‘magic’ for comparative purposes. For similar considerations regarding the interpretation of abhicāra, see Türstig \(1985: 70–75\). 

**9** See Spiers in this volume. Pantulu \(1939: 388\) points out that the negative view on the Atharvaveda is a product of Western scholarship that is “unfair and incorrect” since it does not acknowledge the significance of the Atharvaveda as an “integral part of Vedic literature”. 

**10** See Holdrege \(1994\) on this process. The significance of the shift from “three Vedas” to “four” 

should not be underestimated since it marks the closure of the canon. Further enhancements are marked by texts that claim to be a “fifth Veda” \(like the Mahābhārata\), but this does not result in changing the designation of the four Vedas, see Malinar \(2011\).

ambivalent and depends on the interests of the communities supporting or reject-

ing Atharvavedic traditions. This situation points to a cultural-historical context in the transition from the late Vedic to the classical period, in which established religious authorities are challenged by new or alternative teachers. B. K. Smith 

\(1989\) has studied some of the repercussions of this transformation for the Vedic ritual tradition, particularly the growing importance of gṛhya and kāmya rituals at the expense of śrauta rituals. The Mahābhārata is an important document of the negotiation of these transformations that consolidated in the centuries before and after the beginning of the Common Era and is marked by a pluralization of religious practices available for householders.11 The representation of Vedic ritualism in the epic is influenced by these contestations and the polyvalent representation of Atharvavedic practices in the Mahābhārata also mirrors this cultural-historical constellation. 

**2  References to the Atharvaveda**

Before discussing some of these representations more closely, a brief overview 

of the references to the Atharvaveda and related practices shall help to put them in context.12 It is important to distinguish between passages that merely mention persons, texts, or practices connected to the Atharvaveda from those in which they assume a function in the epic plot or one of the sub-tales transmitted in the epic. 

Most references relate to stories featuring Brahmin priests and teachers asso-

ciated with the Atharvaveda, some of which have been studied in connection 

with Sukthankar’s “Bhṛguization” theory \(see note 3\). Another set of references 

mentions the Atharvaveda in enumerations of the Vedic saṃhitā s, for instance in descriptions of auspicious places.13 In most instances, they are mentioned in 

connection with monotheistic cosmologies propagated in the epic. At 3.187.14 the 

four Vedas are said to have been created by God Hari-Kṛṣṇa, and 13.17.88–89 states that the four Vedas constitute body parts of God Śiva \(the Atharvaveda is identified with the head\). The Nārāyaṇīya recounts that the newly created authoritative treatise that promulgates God Hari-Nārāyaṇa as the supreme being is favoured in 

**11** See the essays in Olivelle \(2006\) for the larger socio-political transformations, and Malinar \(2020\) on religious plurality in the epic. 

**12** In a brief overview, Patyal \(1993: 153\) stresses the acceptance of the Atharvaveda, but since he does not deal in greater detail with the passages he refers to, some of his interpretations are questionable so that the over-all picture he draws seems one-sided. 

**13** See 1.64.31–33 as a feature of the hermitage of Kaṇva, and 2.11.23 in the description of the god Brahmā’s heavenly assembly hall. 

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **281**

the Vedic hymns \( ṛgyajuḥsāmabhir juṣṭam atharvāṅgirasais tathā 12.322.37–38\) and that they include his names \(12.328.8; 12.235.4/98 lists atharvaśiras as one of his names\). 12.330.32–34 mentions that those “who know the hymns of the Atharvaveda” consider him “as the Atharvaveda that comprises five kalpa s \(five types of ritual\) and is strengthened by incantations”, pañcakalpam atharvāṇaṃ kṛtyābhiḥ 

paribṛṃhitam; 330.34\). These instances represent the Atharvaveda as an integral part of the Vedic canon. This is also the case when the canon is referred to as trayī, but explicitly includes the Atharvaveda. This attests to a process of canon formation in which the original designation coexisted with another one \( caturveda\) that made the inclusion explicit.14 However, the joint mention of both words is an exception in the epic since in most cases trayī  is referred to as one of the sciences \( vidyā\) a king should study.15 The following discussion focuses on another group of references 

that concern the function and the effects of rites associated with the Atharvaveda that aim to control others. 

**2.1  Rites to Subdue: abhicāra**** and kṛtyā**

The epic includes several references to abhicāra and kṛtyā, which are explicitly or implicitly connected to Atharvan-Aṅgiras and/or the Atharvaveda and to contexts 

in which they are used to control and subjugate others. Some passages stress their tremendous, even terrible power and their efficacy in fighting enemies. These rites are used either to realize the hostile intentions of their performer or to prevent the hostility of others. In the battle books, the efficacy of a weapon to kill the enemy is compared to that of atharvāṅgiras rites.16 An instruction at 13.101 about the flowers to be used for worshipping deities and demons for various purposes, mentions that plants with red blooms that are pungent and have spikes are taught in Atharvaveda **14** See 12.227.1, and Patyal \(1993:150\). The few references to caturveda are mostly in theistic contexts; see, for instance, 3.194.12, 12.326.8, 100, 12.327.100, 13.135.95. At 13.10.34 the Atharvaveda is enumerated as a topic of study separately from the Veda. 

**15** See, for instance, 3.49.31, 3.189.23, 12.18.32, 12.59.33, 12.90.7, 12.123.19. This usage probably draws on Arthaśāstra 1.3.1–2, which distinguishes between trayī  as vidyā and the Vedas which include the Atharvaveda. 13.16.48–49 describes God Śiva being worshipped with recitation from the three Vedas \(some mss add the Atharvaveda\). 

**16** At 9.16.41–43 Yudhiṣṭhira throws at Śalya a radiant, terrible rod that is blazing like the fire at the end of time and is terrible \( ugra\) like an atharvāṅgiras rite. The latter is also said at 8. 67.21 

about the arrow Arjuna unleashed to kill Karṇa, who also possessed an arrow endowed with the atharvanic power to destroy an enemy \(8.66.2–3\). 

**282**

hymns \(to be used\) for abhicāra against enemies \(13.101.29\).17 A chapter in Book 13 dealing with the duty of kings to honor the Brahmins includes the warning that Brahmins are terrible \( ugra\) when they are enraged and can destroy everything 

“with rites of subjugation \( abhicāra\), \(various\) means \( upāya\) and even their energy \( tejas\)” \(13.33.7\). These instances confirm the often-mentioned connection of Atharvavedic rites to hostile, violent intentions \(fighting enemies or counteract-ing hostile acts of others\). This is also the case in some of the stories in which they feature prominently, but not in all of them. The following discussion of these narratives addresses the differences in the representation of abhicāra and kṛtyā. What the two practices have in common is that they materialize artificial bodies that are obliged to perform services for the performer of the rite. 

**3  Employing a “Malicious Agent”: Kṛtyā**** **

**in MBh Book 3 and 13**

The epic contains accounts of the ritual production of a special type of servicing agent, called kṛtyā, “malicious agent”, an apparitional body with various, mostly demonic features that fulfils the objectives of the sacrificer. Consequently, standard translations for the word in the Atharvaveda, such as witch or witchcraft are also used for the epic, which is perhaps too general a translation for something quite specific.18 While the gender of these malicious agents seems obvious from the feminine genus of the noun, their actual appearance and thus their gender are not fixed as two episodes included in Book 3 demonstrate. The first episode is intrinsically connected to the epic plot and concerns Duryodhana’s state of mind after he has 

been humiliated by the exiled Pāṇḍavas who came to his rescue during a cattle 

expedition. This incident leaves him so ashamed and defeated that, on his way back to his residence, he decides to commit suicide by fasting to death \(3.227–238\). Karṇa and others try to stop him, but he remains steadfast and prepares himself to put 

his decision into action. When the demons and inhabitants of the lower worlds 

who were formerly defeated by the gods learn about Duryodhana’s resolve they 

fear the destruction of their party as they view Duryodhana as serving their cause. 

They decide to ritually produce a malicious agent, not to save Duryodhana’s life 

\(a possibly non-hostile intention\), but to make him an instrument for their goal to **17**  oṣadhyo raktapuṣpāś ca kaṭukāḥ kaṇṭakānvitāḥ / śatrūṇām abhicārārtham atharvasu nidarśitāḥ 

// 13.101.29. 

**18** See Lal \(1975\) who renders the word with sorcery and witchcraft; for kṛtyā as “malicious contrivance”, see the discussion in Zehnder et al. \(2024\) on Paippalāda-Saṁhitā 1.47. 

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **283**

defeat the gods and their representatives on earth, the Pāṇḍavas. Details of the rites and the texts that were used by the demons are given at 3.239.19–22, mentioning 

mantras used by Uśānas and Bṛhaspati and those included in the Upaniṣad and the 

Atharvaveda, and Brahmins who were experts in the Vedas and their ancillaries 

officiating in the rites. As a result, a kṛtyā arose and asked, as any servant would: 

“What shall I do?” \( kiṃ karomi, 3.239.22\).19 She is sent off to bring Duryodhana to the demons and this is what she does \(239.24–26\). Duryodhana is “brain-washed” 

by the demons who treat him like a son and plant the idea in his head that he 

must fight the Pāṇḍavas and become king. Afterward, Kṛtyā is ordered to return 

him to the place from which she took him, and after fulfilling this task she van-

ishes \(3.240.27–28\) and Duryodhana finds himself as if awoken from a dream. The 

episode continues the Vedic evocation of such malicious agents who function as 

instruments in fulfilling the hostile intentions of the sacrificer. The twist in this narrative is that at the end another servant is activated: Duryodhana, so the story suggests, has been turned into a malicious agent fighting the cause of the demons.20

The story of the inclusion of the Aśvins in the Soma ritual offered to Indra that was brought about by Cyavana, the son of Bhṛgu, demonstrates that kṛtyā is used as a generic term for such malicious agents or servants \(3.123–125\). When a king 

visited his hermitage, Cyavana performed a sacrifice for him in which he offered 

Soma to the Aśvin but was stopped by the god Indra who deemed them unworthy 

to be admitted to the Soma cult because of their being physicians/healers. A brief argument follows, and then Indra threatens the sage with his vajra, but Cyavana paralyzes his arm. While doing so, he pours another oblation in the fire aiming for \(the production of\) a malicious agent \( kṛtyārthī, 3.124.18\) as he is eager to harm the god \( devaṃ hiṃsitum udyataḥ; ibid.\): “Then from the ascetic power of this sage a malicious agent sprung up called Mada \(frenzy\), a mighty hero, a mighty Asura with a huge body.”21 He rushes to devour Indra who, panic-stricken, grants the Aśvins 

access to Soma and gives further blessings to the sage \(3.125.1–6\). Cyavana then 

withdraws Mada by distributing his components among liquor, women, dice, and 

hunting \(3.125.8\) through which he/it is reproduced again and again. The hostile 

intentions of the sacrifice are perfectly mirrored in the malicious agent that is produced during a Soma rite. Furthermore, the story attests to the contestations about the admission of new or previously marginalized gods and their priests to the Vedic **19** This formula is repeated by the other servant-bodies produced as kṛtyā or by abhicāra rites at MBh 3.239.22, 3.290.10, and 13.94.41 \(see also below\). 

**20** The significance of this interpretation of Duryodhana for the epic plot cannot be further discussed here, since text-historical considerations are outside the scope of this article, **21**  tataḥ kṛtyā samabhavad ṛṣes tasya tapobalāt / mado nāma mahāvīryo bṛhatkāyo mahāsuraḥ //

pantheon and sacrifice which is here connected to the line of Bhṛgu and implicitly to Atharvavedic textual communities. 

The story of Cyavana connects the agency embodied by \(a\) kṛtya with women when the Indra-threatening malicious agent Mada was removed by distributing 

some of its components to women. This connection is a topic in two passages in 

Book 13 which represent a critical view on that agency and substantiate misogynistic attitudes that serve to justify the control of women \(under the heading of protection, rakṣā\). Misogyny is here based on an ambivalent image of women as being dangerous and scheming and therefore hard to control as well as ignorant and 

ridiculous and therefore easy to subdue. The first aspect is the focus of 13.38–40 

which contains a misogynistic instruction about the dangerous nature and mali-

cious activities of women, particularly wives, and how to control them. The text 

includes a story about the creation of women, which equates them with kṛtyā s, malicious agents. It is told in response to Yudhiṣṭhira’s request to learn about the female disposition \( svabhāva\) “since women, being light-minded, are the root cause of flaws” \( striyo hi mūlaṃ doṣāṇāṃ laghucittāḥ, 13.38.1\). Bhīṣma replies that once upon a time the sage Nārada put the same request to the Apsaras Pañcacūḍā \(also 

called a prostitute\). What follows confirms the general opinion that women are the root of all evils voiced earlier by Yudhiṣṭhira \(38.1c = 38.12c\), which is now put in the mouth of a woman, who belongs to a class of celestial beings often depicted as seducers of righteous, wise men. Women, she says, do not adhere to the moral code of conduct \( maryādā, 38.11\) and use every opportunity to escape control and make love to men regardless of quality and appearance. The speech concludes with the 

following statement \(38.29–30\) about women as a class of beings marked by flaws 

\( doṣa\) that came into existence when the world was created: “Final destruction, termination, death, the abode of demons and serpents, the fiery mouth of the sub-marine mare, the edge of a razor, venom, snake, fire – women are all this in one.”22 

Yudhiṣṭhira now wants to know why men still attach themselves to women, who 

are masters of deception and able to turn the truth into a lie and vice versa: “The authoritative text \(on politics\) Uśānas possessed and the one Bṛhaspati possessed is not better than the insight \(intelligence\) of women. How then can they be guarded by men? \[. . .\] I think that the authoritative texts on politics \( arthaśāstrāṇi\) were produced by wise men such as Bṛhaspati and others by extracting them from the 

insights of women.”23 The connection between the methods employed by women to

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **285**

pursue their interests and the techniques taught in the Arthaśāstra\(s\) put forward in this passage highlights the tensions between the normative orders of Brahmins 

and rulers or Kṣatriyas, whose dharma revolves around the subjection of others, and the protection of themselves from enemies and threats within and without 

the household and kingdom. The view that the intelligence or knowledge \( buddhi\) of women in “household politics” is the template for politics at large highlights the problematic conjugal and familial life in patrilineal kinship structures. The epic contains many episodes addressing these structures, but in the passage under discussion, the agency of women is interpreted as being intrinsically connected to 

hostile, dangerous, even demonic agency. Their agency is a property of the world 

designed by the creator god. This situation is explained in Bhīṣma’s reply at an 

even more fundamental, cosmological level, which corroborates their function as 

serving and fulfilling the goals of their superiors \(be they men or gods\). After repeating his view of women as poison, death, etc. Bhīṣma explains that in the original creation, beings followed the law \( dhārmika, 13.40.5\), and therefore the gods were afraid that the creatures would themselves attain the status of a deity \( devatvam\). 

The gods approached the creator god who knew immediately what they wished for. 

Therefore: “For the purpose of confusing men the lord created women as kṛtyā s, malicious agents \(fulfilling the hostile intentions of others\). Although in the former creation, son of Kuntī, women here on earth were virtuous, yet they were created 

as malicious agents \( kṛtyā\) from Prajāpati’s \(second\) creation.”24 After an elaborate story about how to protect a wife from the advances of another man \(in this case 

Indra in disguise\), Bhīṣma concludes that women are both, virtuous “mothers of the world” \(13.43.19\) and wicked and that one must protect oneself from the malicious aspect of their agency, since they are, after all, malicious agents \( kṛtyā\), fit for the task and created for it \(43.23\). The hostile effects of these female agents mirror the harmful intentions of the gods who want to avert a potential threat to their superiority. While this fear of the gods is a well-known trope, the passage makes kṛtyā an integral part of the cosmic order, that is also employed by the gods.25 The parallelism between the dangerous traits of women and kṛtyā conveys a mixed message. 

On the one hand, it justifies methods of control and subjection under the heading of 

“protection” \( rakṣā\) of as well as against women. On the other hand, their negative properties are accorded a function that follows their generally subjected, inferior status as dependent beings, whose task is defined by the interests and purposes of those they are obliged to serve. Their skills in household politics keep husbands **24**  mānavānāṃ pramohārthaṃ kṛtyā nāryo ‘sṛjat prabhuḥ // 13.40.7cd // pūrvasarge tu kaunteya sādhvyo nārya ihābhavan / asādhvyas tu samutpannā kṛtyā sargāt prajāpateḥ // 13.40.8. 

**25** The fact that both gods and demons use and produce kṛtyā is emphasized by Lal \(1975\).

busy and entangled in desires that avert them from obtaining higher goals, such 

as deity status. They function like any other kṛtyā that is made to serve the hostile intentions of their creators, in this case of the creator-god who addresses the jeal-ousy of the gods. In this way, the ambiguous character of the agency of women is 

given a cosmological status, it belongs to the order of things, like demons, snakes, and poison. However, the dangerous aspects of their agency can be curbed and 

effaced by methods of control and by knowledge of the signs that disclose malicious intentions. 

This is the point of a story featuring a kṛtyā called Yātudhānī \(13.93–95\). A king named Vṛṣādarbhi is enraged by a group of emaciated Brahmins who roam 

around in the forest in search of food together with their entourage, and yet refuse to accept his gifts. In retaliation, when he returns to his house, he offers oblations together with mantras into the āhavanīya fire, from which arises “a malicious agent terrifying people” \( kṛtyā lokabhayaṃkarī, 13.94.40\). The king calls her  yātu-dhānī, which in the epic is a generic designation of demons and evil spirits.26 Under her servant status, she shows her reverence and asks the king what she should do 

\( kiṃ karomi, 94.41, see also note 19\). The king sends her to the group of Brahmins to ask them their names so that she can kill them. After accomplishing this task, she is free to go wherever she wants. Yātudhānī sets out to the forest and presents herself to the group as the guardian of a pond of lotus flowers that the group of Brahmins wishes to access so that they can suck the lotus stalks. They ask her who she is, what she is doing here, and for what purpose. She replies, “I am who I am” 

\( yāsmi sāsmy, 13.95.21\), and that she guards the pond. When the sages explain that they are hungry and want to take the lotus stalks she commands them to tell her 

their names before she allows them to enter the pond. Next unfolds a satirical conversation in which Yātudhānī is ridiculed because of her of her poor command 

of Sanskrit. Starting with the sage Atri, who, as the narrator Bhīṣma relates, has already identified the “guardian” and her plan to kill them, each member of the 

group explains his and her name with an “etymological” \( nirukta\) pun Yātudhānī 

is unable to understand. In the end, she is punished for her ignorance. She is hit on the head with the triple staff of the ascetic Śunaḥsakha and reduced to ashes 

\(95.47–48\). The story illustrates the superior power of discerning knowledge and 

of the true, Brahmanical command of Sanskrit over and against \(ritually produced\) servants with malicious intentions and of terrible appearance whose dangerous-ness can be controlled because their understanding is circumscribed by the tasks 

and vocabulary of those who deploy them. The two episodes in Book 13 resonate

with each other in their propagating the idea that women who are created to func-

tion \(also\) as malicious agents preventing men from obtaining the merits they need to obtain godlike status. But women are as controllable as a ritually created kṛtyā 

serving the hostile intentions of individual householders \(in particular, kings\). The issue of domestic power relations is also at the centre of following episodes discussed below which depict women as \(ritual\) agents bringing about the submis-

siveness of others. 

**4  Ambiguous Methods of Subjugation: **

**abhicāra****, saṃvanana**

In some epic passages, Atharvaveda-related practices are connected to individual 

desires and conjugal interests that imply the control or subjugation of a family 

member or another person \( vaśīkaraṇa, saṃvadana/saṃvanana,  see below\). The purpose of these rites is not hostile; they are not carried out to harm another person, but rather to fulfil one’s desires and to ensure conjugal, even familial peace and happiness. In contrast to the harm abhicāra may cause to enemies or strangers, it is evaluated differently when directed at a member of the household or at someone one 

feels attracted to. These instances corroborate studies emphasizing that the effect and assessment of ritual practice depend on the context.27 The issue at stake is not 

“sorcery”, that is “hostile” in one case, and “benevolent” in another,28 but rather how to interpret the subduing power that is common to abhicāra in both cases.29 The epic **27** See, for instance, Türstig \(1985\). 

**28** See Patyal \(1993:151\), who uses this expression in cases that demonstrate the “non-hostile” employment of abhicāra; also Mehendale \(2008: 132\), who notes that in one epic episode abhicāra does not mean “black magic”. Türstig \(1985\) points out that ‘sorcery’ as the general translation of the term is too broad and incorrect since “not each case of abhicāra \[. . .\] belongs to the sphere of sorcery” \(1985: 70\). Patton \(2005: 126\) notes without further explanation that abhicāra should not be translated as curse or sorcery but is “best translated as “going toward”, or “goingfully”; in the glossary it is defined as “to proceed against” and as a sacrifice “involving offerings and impreca-tions against an enemy, either human or divine” \(ibid.: 237\). 

**29** This question is also at issue in epic passages dealing with subjugating power of Vedic rituals in general \(see for instance MBh 5.60; on which see Malinar 2012\). It also plays a role in academic debates on questions as to whether ‘magic’ is a typical feature of ritualism in ancient or primitive religions like the Vedic \(see Sahoo 2008–2009\), and whether it is appropriate to use it for drawing distinctions within ritual traditions. The latter is the case when distinguishing Ṛgvedic and Atharvavedic rituals by viewing the former as ‘religion’ or ‘great tradition’ and the latter as ‘magic’ or ‘little tradition’/‘folk religion’, see Bhattacharji 1981 for ‘great’ and ‘little’ tradition\). On the problematics of such uses of ‘magic’ for the Vedic ritual tradition, see Türstig \(1985: 74–75\), and Patton \(2005\).

instances discussed in the following demonstrate that the ambiguous position of 

Atharvavedic practices is also based on the polyent perception of ‘subjugation’ as an aim and instrument of ritual agency. Control and submission are important topics in household life, particularly for women who are, according to certain accounts in the epic, faced with increasing restrictions on their agency due to the emergence of the pativratā ideology that postulates the permanent dependence of women in the patrilineal kinship system. Consequently, the status of women was defined according to the range of power and control they could exert within the household.30 Knowledge of how this control could be exerted was therefore an essential requirement. Epic representations of such methods address their role in regulating domestic, particularly conjugal power relations, and they point to an extra-diegetic, cultural-historical discourse about their appropriateness. What is at issue in the epic passages is not the desire to control or subdue but the methods that serve the ritual agent’s purpose best. 

**4.1  The Conversation between Draupadī and Satyabhāmā **

**\(MBh 3.222–223\)**

The question of appropriate means of controlling husbands is at the centre of a conversation between Queen Draupadī and Kṛṣṇa’s wife Satyabhāmā \(MBh 3.222–223\) 

which takes place during the Pāṇḍavas’ forest exile. This text has often been interpreted as a straightforward propagation of the pativratā ideology of the submissive wife by turning Draupadī into its advocate.31 While this ideology is an essential feature of the text, this does not mean that it is praised or propagated unconditionally. Laurie Patton, for instance, emphasizes the “multivocality” of the text. While it advocates female “servitude”, it also acknowledges the “basic power dynamics” 

between husband and wife and the fact that submission is mutual \(2007: 100, 104\). 

In connecting the conversation to the larger topic of control as a fundamental 

aspect of conjugal life, I suggest that the conversation revolves around the question of how to exert power from a position of subordination, and thereby puts a wife’s **30** See, for instance, MBh 1.113.3ff on the freedom of women in the past \(of the time narrated in the epic\); for a discussion, see Malinar \(2014\). The view that in Vedic times women enjoyed greater freedom than in the classical age is also referred to as the “Altekarian paradigm” \(after A. S. Altekar’s The position of women in Indian civilization from prehistoric times to the present day published in 1938\), and has been criticized for its implicit nationalist historiography, see for instance Chakravarti \(1999\). 

**31** Van Buitenen’s summary of contents, for instance, downplays the issue of control when he suggests that the conversation is about how to keep husbands happy \(1975: 664\). 

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **289**

“ideal behaviour” in perspective by highlighting the suffering it entails. The dialogue begins with Satyabhāmā’s questioning Draupadī about how she has got the 

Pāṇḍavas, “heroes comparable to the world guardians”, under her control. Says 

Satyabhāmā: “How is it that they are obedient \( vaśaga\) to you and yet not angry \(with you\). For the Pāṇḍavas are always under your control, lovely lady, as they are all watching your face \(to detect your intentions/desires\).32 Tell me what is this all about: Is it the observance of a vow, or austerities, or ablutions, spells, and herbs? 

The power of a special knowledge, the power of a root? Muttered recitation and fire oblation, or drugs?”33 Draupadī is asked to reveal her “glorious knowledge of conjugal happiness” because Satyabhāmā would likewise have her husband Kṛṣṇa in 

her control \( vaśaga; 222.7\). In her reply pativratā \(222.8\) Draupadī does not reject the idea that husbands should be controlled by their wives, but only the methods 

Satyabhāmā has enumerated because they belong to the path \( mārga\) unfaithful women \( asatstrī\) follow. Draupadī explains that the use of mantras and roots \(typically associated with the Atharvaveda\) is dangerous as they may produce undesir-

able effects. When these practices are carried out in private by the wife without the knowledge and consent of the husband, they disturb conjugal relations: “Indeed, 

should a husband find out that his wife engages in mantras and roots,34 he gets 

frightened of her as of a snake that has entered the house. What peace does a frightened man have, and what happiness without peacefulness? Never will a husband 

be obedient to his wife because of a mantra.”35 Furthermore, when using poisonous substances they may cause serious damage: “Women make their men dropsical 

that way, or leprous, gray-haired, impotent, dumb, blind, or deaf.”36 The criticism is here directed at the collateral damage of such practices, which in this case proves **32** The expression mukhaprekṣāś illustrates the Pāṇḍavas’ submissiveness as they, like servants, are eager to “read” their wife’s face. It could also be rendered as “regarding you at the best / chief”, although the first meaning seems the obvious one. Nevertheless, it would point to Draupadī’s status as “chief queen” among the sapatni s her husbands have brought into the household and to her position as the chief of the household \(see below\).

counter-productive to the overall goal of controlling husbands to secure conjugal peace. 

Interestingly, means that would allow a husband to stop his wife from engaging 

in these practices are not mentioned. Instead, for him fear and distrust become 

part of conjugal life which is epitomized in the metaphor of the snake. This points to the situation that the husband’s means of controlling his wife, a topic which is in Dharmaśāstra literature referred to as “protection” \( rakṣā\), are limited. This is also true for the wife since husbands also have snake-like qualities as is made clear when the snake metaphor resurfaces in Draupadī’s speech. After explaining that 

her control method is paricāra, serving and attending to her husbands, she states: 

“I attend to my husbands who are wrathful like venomous snakes \[so that they 

become\] gentle, faithful, dedicated to truth, and keepers of the true law.”37 In her discussion of the verse Patton makes the point that the tension between the description of the husbands as being gentle, on the one hand, and terrifying as poisonous snakes on the other, should not be smoothed out by interpreting the snake comparison as “ironic”. She suggests that it is another instance of the text’s awareness of the marital power balance. My rendering of the verse suggests that the contrast-ing attributes used for the husbands serve to highlight the efficacy of Draupadī’s methods: making fierce, snake-like husbands become gentle.38 This resonates with 

the beginning of the conversation when Satyabhāmā wondered why the Pāṇḍavas 

are not angry in her presence. The acknowledgment of a potential “snake-likeness” 

of husbands and wives points to the danger that conjugal life becomes poisonous 

and turns into the snake pit that it potentially always is.39 The danger posed by disaffection and unhappiness in the conjugal relationship is one of the reasons for the **37**  mṛdūn sataḥ satyaśīlān satyadharmānupālinaḥ / āśīviṣān iva kruddhān patīn paricarāmy aham 

// 3.222.34. 

**38** Patton repeats the predicate in her translation: “I serve my truthful, gentle husbands, who have the ethics and the dharma of truth, and watch over them as if they were poisonous angry snakes.” \(Patton 2007: 102\). Van Buitenen \(1975: 666\) translates: “I wait on my meek enough, truthful enough, virtuous enough husbands as though they were furious venomous snakes.” In both translations the meaning of the comparison is not completely clear nor of the juxtaposition of attributes. Are the husbands gentle, but are nevertheless treated like angry snakes? But why, and where is the irony Patton mentions? My rendering suggests the use of a double accusative \(see PW 

s.v. √car, “Jmd. \(acc.\) zu Etwas \(acc.\) machen”\) and that the verse describes the effect of Draupadī’s care that turns angry husbands into gentle ones. Furthermore, the particle iva is taken as comparing the angriness with the snakes and not with the husbands. 

**39** Yudhiṣṭhira’s final remark after his wife has died in the Himalayan snow \(that she loved his younger brother Arjuna better\) attests to such potential \(17.2.2–6\). At MBh 13.19.1–9 Yudhiṣṭhira expresses his anxiety that the rule of “sahadharma” in marriage would also apply in the after world even though each partner acted quite differently, and women are known to be “false” \( anṛta\). 

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **291**

employment of control methods. Because of the asymmetrical power-relationship 

within a patrilineal household, the agency of women is limited by her subordinate position which entails that her methods of control must ideally comply with the 

pativratā ideology. 

Yet the pativratā ideology is here presented as revolving around the issue of control. The verbal compound pari\+√car \(attend to, watch over\) signifies Draupadī’s comprehensive caring-controlling agency in the domestic realm. Draupadī’s 

paricāra method resembles the rejected practices in having the purpose of controlling others \( vaśīkaraṇa\). But these practices also differ concerning the ritual paraphernalia and their performance. In contrast to mantramūla and other potentially harmful rites carried out secretly, Draupadī’s paricāra is displayed in her ruling the household through the observance of duties. It is a method that operates in the dialectic of serving and observing typical for asymmetrical power relations. 

This dialectic creates for the subjected wife a realm of control. This is pointed out by Draupadī at the end of her first speech when she explains that she is running the whole household including the treasury by watching “day and night” over everyone and everything, being the only one who has the complete picture.40 She con-

cludes: “I always wake up earliest and go to bed last, dear Satyā. This is my spell of subjection \( saṃvanana\). So, I know how to carry out a spell of subjecting husbands, a mighty one. I will not adopt the methods of unfaithful women, nor do I wish to.”41

Paricāra is here presented as being on a par with saṃvadana, “spell for subduing a loved one”, The last-mentioned expression belongs to the problematic of 

subjugation methods \( mantramūla, abhicāra\) and is also mentioned in śāstra texts endorsing such practices in domestic settings \(see below section 5\). The pativratā 

ideology is depicted here as including methods of exercising domestic control. 

Paricāra is thus not only the counterpart of abhicāra but also of the task of “protection” \( rakṣā\) that the Dharmaśāstras demand from the husband as an important element in ensuring a wife’s obedience. However, the “obedient dutifulness” 

of the wife that begets the husband’s “obedience” does not manifest a “balance of power” as Patton \(2007: 104\) suggests.42 The wife’s position of structural subjection **40** Accordingly, the controlling power of her knowledge is stressed by the repeated use of the first-person pronoun with verbs of knowledge: “I alone know” \( ekāhaṃ vedmi, 322.51, 54; vedāham, 322.46; jānāmy ahaṃ, 322.57\).

**42** Without dealing with the epic text in greater detail, Shah criticizes Patton’s \(and others\) interpretation as “glossing” over the conformism of the pativratā ideology and rejects it as being based on “semantic jugglery” and “contextual postering” that “do not reveal any social truths” 

\(Shah 2012: 86\). While a too positive depiction of conjugal power-balance in the text is certainly 

**292**

within the patrilineal household remains as undisputed as the anxieties it causes for the wife. The fundamental asymmetry of conjugal relations is made clear in 

Draupadī’s second address when she points out that a husband is a “deity” \( daivata\) like no other: “For all \(one’s\) wishes are his \(with him\). When he is in good spirits, they \[the wishes\] are fulfilled, when he gets angry, he will kill \(them/you\).”43 All the wife’s happiness, subsistence, and social status depend on this volatile, irritable 

“deity”. Unsurprisingly, the wife’s path \( mārga\) to obtain and consolidate all this is painful \( duḥkha\), not pleasant \(223.4.\). Draupadī’s statement offers a depiction of the household situation from the perspective of a subordinate wife’s need to 

control the extent of her subjection. She takes care that the erratic \(and potentially irritable\) husband-deity acts benevolently \(fulfilling her desires, balancing her submission through putting her in control of those who are even more subjected\). The conversation thus discloses and at the same time confirms the fundamental asymmetry of the domestic power relations. 

Still, another facet of the domestic constellation comes to the fore when the text touches upon the question of how the knowledge about such control methods is circulated. Draupadī states that her methods include also domestic rituals \( sthālīpāka etc.\), which Kuntī, her śvaśrū, her mother-in-law taught her.44 It comes as no surprise that a key figure in the household, the mother-in-law, is mentioned here. She must ensure that her household rules and regulations are followed by the incoming wife, and this includes taking precautions against any harm caused by ritual 

and other knowledge the new household member may possess. However, Draupadī 

does not know – being a character in the epic plot – that Kuntī is knowledgeable 

in Atharvavedic subjection mantra s belonging to the abhicāra-type of rituals and thus of the very practices Draupadī rejects in the conversation with her friend. 

Interestingly, and perhaps ironically, Kuntī has received these mantras as a reward for paricāra, in this case for acting as a servant to a Brahmin. The epic’s depiction of Kuntī’s uses of these mantra s in pre-marital, marital, and intra-familial contexts sheds further light on the ambiguous position of Atharvavedic practices in the epic. 

misleading, a close reading of the conversation sheds light on the familial hierarchies and anxieties which motivate the strive for control and qualifies the view that the text simply propagates female submission as the best of all worlds.

In contrast to van Buitenen’s \(1975: 667\), my translation highlights the situation that the husband “owns” all desires \( tasya hi; including the wife’s\) and acts accordingly. One could speculate about what is “special” about this “deity” \(its arbitrariness, the absence of a non-self-serving response to the desires of others or else?\).

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **293**

**4.2  Kuntī’s abhicāra**

Kuntī’s command of subduing mantra s is a recurrent topic in the epic. It is related on different occasions by different speakers to different audiences, which shows how controversial the matter was.45 The matter is further complicated by the fact that Kuntī’s employment of subjection mantras is connected to both non-marital and 

marital frameworks of female ritual agency. As a reward for servicing a Brahmin 

who visited her \(social\) father’s residence, young Kuntī obtained mantra s which enabled her to summon any god she desired. The epic relates that she uses these 

mantra s on three occasions: \(1\) before her marriage, to summon the sun god Sūrya \(which resulted in the pre-marital, secret birth of the epic hero Karṇa\), \(2\) after her marriage to King Pāṇḍu to beget the sons her husband cannot beget due to a 

curse \(this leads to the birth of three of the five Pāṇḍava heroes\), and \(3\) for co-wife Mādrī, who also cannot have offspring with her husband for the same reason \(this 

produces the Pāṇḍava twins\). How is Kuntī’s ritual knowledge represented? 

**4.2.1  The Accounts in Book 1 \(1.104, 1.113–115\)**

Book 1 includes two accounts of Kuntī’s abhicāra practice. The first one relates to the pre-marital acquisition and the first employment of the mantra s \(1.104\). The second tells that Kuntī revealed to her husband that she possesses the mantras 

and uses them to produce legitimate sons \(1.113–114\). The first account is pro-

vided by the bard Vaiśampāyana as part of the genealogy of the heroes \(1.104\). 

Kuntī’s father Vasudeva gave his first-born daughter to Kuntibhoja, the childless son of his father’s sister, who commanded her to worship deities and guests. In 

this role, “she attended to that fierce, awful Brahmin of accomplished vows, pos-

sessing profound knowledge in matters of law, who is known as Durvāsas.”46 

Satisfied with her service and because he contemplated the law of distress \( āpad-dharma\), the “fierce” sage Durvāsas gave her a mantra “equipped with subjecting power” \( abhicārasaṃyukta\). He explained: “Through the favour \( prasāda\) of whichever god you will summon with this mantra, you will obtain a son.”47 Out of curiosity \( kautūhalāt\) Kuntī invoked Sūrya and was amazed \( vismita\) when the god appeared and impregnated her. After she gave birth to Karṇa, Sūrya restored

her virginity \( kanyātvam, 1.104.12\). Concealing her misconduct \( apacāra\) out of fear of her relatives \( bandhupakṣabhayāt\) she abandoned the child. This brief account does not treat abhicāra as a hostile rite to which those who are subjected to it react with hostility. Rather, the sun god is obliging in both fulfilling the task he was given and by restoring Kuntī’s virginity. Nevertheless, young Kuntī misbe-haved since “curiosity” should not be a motive to use mantra s \(pointing, among other things, to an undesirable lack of śraddhā, confidence in its efficacy\). Furthermore, although virginity was restored, Kuntī is still the mother of an illegitimate son, and this secret carries the risk of her being exposed as unfaithful.48 It does not help that Kuntī obviously did not understand that the time for employing the mantra  had not yet arrived, namely, the situation of distress that was envisaged by Durvāsas when he rewarded her. Such distress, which necessitates the 

mantra’s deployment and confirms Durvāsas’ foresight, arises only in her marriage when due to a curse her husband Pāṇḍu is hindered from producing off-

spring and is therefore barred from the heavenly regions. 

The question of how to beget sons without risking the husband’s life is the topic of a conversation between Kuntī and Pāṇḍu \(1.113–114\) in which she discloses her 

ritual knowledge, but not the secret of the illegitimate son. The debate about desirable and non-desirable ways of producing offspring starts when Kuntī refuses her 

husband’s command to produce a son with another man.49 Pāṇḍu insists that she 

has no choice because she must do what he wants irrespective of whether it con-

forms to the law or not \( dharmyam adharmyam vā; 1.113.27\). At this point, and at what appears to be her last resort, Kuntī tells her husband about the collection of mantra s she obtained in her youth from the Brahmin Durvāsas as a reward for the dutiful service she delivered to him. Her speech \(1.113.31–37\) is an almost verbatim parallel to the previously discussed passage at 1.104 \(the verb forms are adapted to first-person speech\) with two notable exceptions. Firstly, Durvāsas’ motive for giving the mantras is not mentioned \(law of distress\); instead, it is represented as a boon \( vara\). Secondly, in the reading of the critical edition, his explanation of the mantra differs. Kuntī says: “The venerable sage announced a boon for me equipped 

with subjugating power \( abhicārasaṃyukta\) and gave me a band of mantras \( mantragrāma\). And then he instructed me as follows: ´Whichever god you will summon with the mantra he, wishing to or not, shall come into your power\!”50 The differences in wording are significant since they have repercussions for the interpreta-48 This risk becomes reality when, after the battle, Yudhiṣṭhira learns that Karṇa was his elder brother. He accuses his mother for not revealing the secret, and curses women \(MBh 12.1\).

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **295**

tion of the abhicāra  character of the mantras.51 Kuntī’s account stresses the subduing effect of the mantra more strongly than that of the bard at 1.104. She reports that every god must comply, whether he wants to or not \( akāmo vā sakāmo vā\). The idea of “favour” \( prasāda\) is not mentioned, nor is the implication of begetting offspring. The bard’s account mentions Durvāsas’ profound knowledge of dharma and his foresight of “distress”. Thereby the deed of the fierce \( ugra\) and awful \( ghora\) Brahmin,52 who is in command of abhicāra, appears wise and legitimate even though it results in Kuntī’s “misconduct”. At the same time, the subjecting character of the mantras is downplayed in that the gods are not represented as obeying Kuntī, but as giving her a favour \( prasāda, 1.104.7\). 

The emphasis in Kuntī’s account is on the control \( vaśa\) she obtains through the mantras. Although they cause gods to act as servants – which can be seen as 

a reason for viewing abhicāra rites as ‘hostile’ –, their use by the wife for the sake of her husband and the patriliny is legitimate. Consequently, abhicāra is not represented as something “uncanny”, but as an element of a wife’s paricāra. Its employment to fulfil conjugal desires, and even one’s duty \( dharma\) as a householder \(producing offspring\) is not questioned. Kuntī declares that a Brahmin’s speech is true and the moment to make it real has come. With her husband’s permission, and 

thus legitimized by the marital framework, she shall use the mantra on a god of her husband’s choice \(113.38\). Pāṇḍu readily agrees and urges Kuntī to use this method. 

He chooses the god Dharma because he would never unite them with what is not 

the law or with someone who is unrighteous. Pāṇḍu envisions that the son shall be thought of as \(the god\) Dharma incarnate. The double-entendre of dharma as an abstract principle and the god can be viewed as addressing possible doubts about 

the appropriateness of abhicāra. Consequently, Pāṇḍu asks Kuntī to place the law \( dharma\) before her and worship the god Dharma with both ritual offerings and abhicāra \( upacārābhicārābhyām; 1.113.42\). She obliges and after some time53 she summons the god Dharma and begets a son. When after the birth of Arjuna, the 

third son, Pāṇḍu, now greedy for sons \( putralobha, 114.64\), calls on his wife again, sa te vaśam upaiṣyati // 1.113.35. Some mss include a line about begetting a son through the god’s favour. 

**51** An analysis of the differences from a textual-historical perspective is outside the scope of this article, which focuses on the polyvalent epic representation of abhicāra and other Atharvavedic practices. 

**52** The two attributes are typical for describing fierce Brahmins who are ready to carry out violent and hostile rites and are also used in classifying abhicāra practices. However, the characterization of the Brahmin also acknowledges his profound knowledge and foresight that allows him to recognize future misfortune and provide the means to address it \(here the abhicāra mantras\). 

**53** It is said that Kuntī carries out the rite when she hears that her sister-in-law Gāndhārī was pregnant for a year \(1.114.1\).

Kuntī rejects him as follows: “After all, they \(the wise\) do not approve of a fourth childbirth even in times of distress. Further on \(after a fourth\) she may become a loose woman, in the case of a fifth she will become barren \(or: a prostitute\). How can you, who knows this law that is dictated by reason, violate it for the sake of offspring and speak to me as if you have lost your mind?”54 This passage echoes the first account in confirming that the abhicāra practice is justified in times of distress \( āpad\). Furthermore, it is remarkable in its pointing to the labor of childbirth and the repercussions for the female body, which would bring any reasonable person to the conclusion of limiting the number of pregnancies. In the context of the epic, this statement also resonates with Kuntī’s complaint that she feels cheated when her 

co-wife Mādrī gave birth to twins in one act of labor. This is a topic in the account of the third and last employment of the abhicāra-mantra s: Kuntī summons gods to beget sons for Mādrī \(1.115\). 

After the birth of Arjuna, Mādrī tells her husband that she does not resent him 

despite his defects \(this most likely refers to the curse that makes Pāṇḍu practically impotent\). She also does not suffer because she occupies a position inferior to Kuntī, or because her sister-in-law Gāndhārī has given birth to a hundred sons. 

But she cannot put up with the fact that the sonlessness \( aputratā 1.115.4\), which had made her and Kuntī equals, has now come to an end for Kuntī. Now, Mādrī’s 

inferior position has become something painful. However, she suggests that Kuntī 

could help her beget offspring too, this would be a favour to her and good for Pāṇḍu too. Because of her status as a co-wife, she feels unable to approach Kuntī and asks Pāṇḍu to make the request. This brief address points to the dangers of conjugal 

rivalry \(see also above on the snake metaphor\), but also to the fact that it serves patrilineal interests. It is thus unsurprising that Pāṇḍu readily agrees and states that he had already thought about it. He profits most from his second wife’s growing 

unhappiness: he obtains more sons, Mādrī’s grievances are taken care of by Kuntī, and familial peace is ensured; or so it seems. Pāṇḍu urges Kuntī to produce offspring to ensure that funeral rites are carried out properly and “for the sake of what/who is dear to me” \(1.115.01\). Doing so is the “highest virtue” \( kalyāṇam uttamam\) and will bring Kuntī fame and praise comparable to that of gods and Brahmins. Therefore: “Since you are the one, who will carry Mādrī across to the other side with 

the boat that is \(built through\) the sharing of offspring, you will obtain the highest praise.”55 Kuntī obliges and instructs Mādrī to think “just once” of a deity so that **54**  nātaś caturthaṃ prasavam āpatsv api vadanty uta / ataḥ paraṃ cāriṇī syāt pañcame bandhakī bhavet // 1.114.65 // sa tvaṃ vidvan dharmam imaṃ buddhigamyaṃ kathaṃ nu mām /

she will beget offspring accordingly. Mādrī chooses the Aśvins, the beautiful twin gods, and so she begets twins. As his greed for sons is still not quenched Pāṇḍu 

asks Kuntī to perform another abhicāra for Mādrī. But she gives him the following rebuff: “She, who was told ‘just once’, obtained a pair. Therefore, I was deceived. I am afraid of her disrespecting me. The state of women is like this. I had not noticed, foolish me, that in invoking a pair the fruit will be double. Therefore, I must not be commanded \(again\) by you. This shall be the boon that is mine.”56 Kuntī makes 

clear that Pāṇḍu’s understanding of the value of fame and praise does not grasp the condition of women whose status depends on their position in the familial hierarchy, which is here and elsewhere in the epic depicted as fragile and full of tensions. 

Thus, to keep her position as the elder and first wife must be Kuntī’s priority.57

**4.2.2  Kuntī’s Pre-Marital abhicāra**** Retold \(MBh 3.287–292\)**

The abhicāra practices that led to the birth of the Pāṇḍavas are not further mentioned in the epic. However, Kuntī’s pre-marital abhicāra and the birth of Karṇa remain vexing issues. This can be seen in the third account of that episode in Book 3, which is, like the first account in Book 1, narrated by the bard Vaiśampāyana 

to King Janamejaya. After narrating how Karṇa was warned by his father Sūrya 

never to give away his divine earrings, the bard discloses the “secret” \( guhyam\) of the hero’s birth \(there is no reference to his earlier account at 1.104\). The third account is much more elaborate than the first two accounts and differs a lot in the depiction of the characters. The visiting Brahmin is not identified by name, he is neither fierce nor awful but wears a beard and a hair-tuft and carries a staff. He radiates glowing energy, has a mighty stature, “honey-coloured” skin, and a sweet voice.58 The Brahmin asks King Kuntibhoja for hospitality and demands that all 

his wishes be fulfilled, and he better not be offended. Aware of the threat implied **56**  uktā sakṛd dvandvam eṣā lebhe tenāsmi vañcitā / bibhemy asyāḥ paribhavān nārīṇāṃ gatir īdṛśī

tvayaiṣo ’stu varo mama // 1.115.24. 

**57** At 1.116.23 Kuntī’s formulates this hierarchy as follows: “I am the elder wife by the Law, and the greater fruit of the Law is due to me” \(tr. van Buitenen 1973: 260\). 

**58** Mehendale \(2008\) discusses the identity of the Brahmin in all three episodes and rejects the idea that the Brahmin is identical with the “famous sage Durvāsas” who features in the Purāṇas. 

He does not notice that the Brahmin’s characterisation in Book 3 and his physical appearance \(honey-coloured, strong stature\) strongly suggest that it is the god Sūrya \(who is earlier described as honey-coloured, glowing etc.\) who appears here disguised as a Brahmin. This interpretation changes not only the significance of the episode, but also influences the interpretation of the epic plot at large as being entwined with divine plans. 

**298**

in this demand, Kuntibhoja ensures the Brahmin that he shall be waited upon 

perfectly by his daughter. The king tells Kuntī to attend to the Brahmin’s wishes and reminds her of her devotion to Brahmins and the respect she has already 

obtained for her perfect demeanour. He admonishes her to give up boisterousness, 

pretence, and pride and encourages her to please the “boon-granting” Brahmin. 

Otherwise, the family will be ruined \(3.287.28–29\). Kuntī promises to serve the 

Brahmin faithfully and is handed over to him \(3.288\). The bard relates that in 

attending on \( pari √ cār\) the Brahmin, she minded the “purity” rules \( śaucaparā, 288.19\) and never displeased him despite all his threats and unfriendly comments, because “she was as perfectly subdued as a pupil, a son, or a sister” \( śiṣyavat putravac caiva svasṛvac ca susaṃyatā; 3.289.7\). For one year she waited upon the Brahmin like a god \( devavat, 288.19\), and was then offered boons so that she may surpass all women \(289.14\). Kuntī declines the Brahmin’s reward, declaring that 

she has already obtained boons by pleasing her father and the Brahmin. However, 

the Brahmin orders her to accept a mantra from him and explains its modus oper-andi as follows: “Accept this mantra for invoking a deity. Whichever god you will summon with the mantra must stay in your power, my lady. Wishing to or not, 

he shall come under your power. Incapacitated by the mantra, the deity shall be 

like a servant bowing down at \(your\) command\!”59 The bard comments that Kuntī 

was afraid that she would be cursed if she rejected the Brahmin again. Thus, the 

Brahmin taught her a mantragrāma  transmitted in the Atharvaśiras \(3.289.20\), which explicitly connects the mantras with the Atharvaveda textual tradition.60 

The initiatory character of this instruction is supported by the elaborate description of her one-year service to the Brahmin which she performed as perfectly as a student, son, or sister. 

Kuntī’s first employment of the mantras is motivated by her pondering their 

“strength or weakness”, and by her shameful realization that her menses are due 

and she is \(still\) a virgin.61 In this way, the employment of the mantras is connected to a wish to comply with the law that a girl should be married upon her menarche 

\(the earlier remark about her observing the purity rules at 3.288.19 could also be **59**  imaṃ mantraṃ gṛhāṇa tvam āhvānāya divaukasām // 3.289.16 // yaṃ yaṃ devaṃ tvam etena mantreṇāvāhayiṣyasi / tena tena vaśe bhadre sthātavyaṃ te bhaviṣyati // 3.289.17 // akāmo vā 

sakāmo vā na sa naiṣyati te vaśam / vibudho mantrasaṃśānto vākye bhṛtya ivānataḥ // 3.289.18. 

**60** Pantalu \(1939: 409\) suggests that the mantras used by Kuntī may be AV III.16. Atharvaśiras could refer to a first hymn in the AV, or to the Upaniṣad of the same name. 12.235.4/98 lists atharvaśiras as one of the names of Hari-Nārāyaṇa. 13.90.22 counts a person who studies the atharvaśiras among those who should be invited to a śrāddha rite.

interpreted as referring to her menstruation\). At that very moment, Kuntī looked 

at the setting sun and obtained “divine vision” so that she could see the god Sūrya in his beauty. She became curious about the mantra and after purifying her vital 

airs she invoked the god. The latter arrives quickly, almost laughing, having divided himself into two through yoga so that he can be with Kuntī and continue shining in the sky.62 Sūrya’s second body is honey-coloured \(like the visiting Brahmin\), with strong arms and a conch-shaped neck. He addresses Kuntī eagerly and with utmost 

politeness: “I have come under your power, my lady, ready \(for you\) through the 

power of the mantra. What shall I, who is without a will of my own, do, my queen? 

Tell me, I will do it for you.”63 Kuntī’s attempts to annul her rite by claiming that she was only curious \(3.290.11\) and childish \(3.290.23\) prove futile. It is made clear that there is no playing around with a mantra nor with the powers it brings about, and there is no escape from one’s intentions.64 Sūrya states that it is not right to summon a god for no reason and only to send him away. Furthermore, he states 

that Kuntī recited the mantra to beget a son from him and this cannot be revoked. 

Otherwise, she will be guilty of deception, and of exposing the god to ridicule before the other gods. Consequently, she, her family, and the Brahmin will be cursed and destroyed by him. Frightened by this threat, but also by the fear that her consent will ruin her reputation and that of her family, she argues that her virginity must be restored. Sūrya promises to do so and impregnates Kuntī using his “yogic self/body” 

by touching her navel \(3.291.23\). 

This elaborate version of Kuntī’s pre-marital agency points to the intention to 

embed it in a normative framework of social and ritual transactions that allows 

us to view events as if they are happening against the young woman’s will. The 

account depicts Kuntī’s ritual agency as if it were an accident, as something happening to her although she followed all the rules and regulations. Her dutifulness is both shown off and put to the test when a Brahmin arrives at Kuntibhoja’s house. 

Afraid of being cursed by the Brahmin she is depicted as having no other choice 

than to learn the subjugating mantras, and for the same reason she gives up her 

resistance to “give herself away” \( ātmapradāna\) to the Sun God. Her possessing the mantras is represented as a boon she did not want, but also could not ignore. Her using the unwanted gift is not only caused by her curiosity \(as is stated in the other **62** This resonates with the account of Kuntī’s abhicāra to beget offspring for her husband from the god Dharma, who also appeared yogamūrtidhara, having a body \(produced\) by yoga. For Dharma, see 1.114.3; for Sūrya’s “yogic” body, see 3.290.9ab \( yogāt kṛtvā dvidhātmānam\), 291.23, 291,28.

version\) but also by the pressure \(her feeling of “shame”\) of the law that ordains marriage upon menarche. The problem of Kuntī’s use of the mantras is thus connected to dilemmas she faces despite and because of her efforts to fulfil the female duties of service and virtue. 

Though from different perspectives, the three accounts agree in depicting 

Kuntī’s ritual knowledge as a reward for the pious service she offered a visiting Brahmin at her father’s command. However, the ominous figure of the Brahmin signifies danger, as a guest who must be satisfied, a wise man foreseeing misfortune, as a person \(perhaps even a deity in disguise\) who is ready to curse if his wishes are not fulfilled or his ‘gifts’ are rejected. The mantras he offers or, according to the version in Book 3, forces on the young women are no less ambiguous. On the 

one hand, they are as powerful as any Vedic mantra used to evoke the gods, on 

the other hand, their purpose is not to venerate or to seek the gods’ support but rather to subject them to one’s desires, which points to a reversal of the hierarchical order of ritual. The possibility of such use of Vedic rituals is a structural weakness since the ritual acts and the mantras work irrespective of ‘moral’ values regulating the goals and intentions of sacrificers. Again, abhicāra is problematic because the legitimacy of ‘subjection’ as a goal of ritual is a matter of interpretation as the previous discussion has demonstrated. Furthermore, the initiation into these mantras endows Kuntī with a pre-marital ritual expertise which results in a transgression, because she uses it of her own accord. The moral of this part of the story could be found in a warning against female initiation in Vedic mantras, perhaps particularly in Atharvavedic ones, and thus against enabling females to use them before or outside of marriage. However, the possession of the knowledge is no longer an issue when it is put into “regular”, legitimate domestic use at her distressed husband’s behest for producing offspring for him and even for her co-wife Mādrī. The initiatory overtones are perhaps most explicit when the epic bard mentions the Atharvaśiras as the textual source of the mantras. The fact that Kuntī has somehow been initiated in the mantras also becomes obvious in her assuming somehow priestly 

functions when practicing the Vedic mantras for her co-wife Mādrī. In all three 

instances neither the Atharvaveda nor the abhicāra are marked as deviant, it is the extra-marital context that makes their use transgressive. The context-dependence is not appropriately represented when translating abhicāra as “black magic” 

or “sorcery”. When viewed from the perspective of Kuntī as the ritual agent the 

employment of the mantra s is not motivated by hostile intentions. Yet it is also true that we are dealing here with depictions of the use of Atharvavedic mantras as 

means of enforcement and subjection, of employing gods as servants \( bhṛtya ivānataḥ, 3.289.18\). The gods are instruments here, but there is nothing “uncanny” about it and the summoned gods also do not react inimically. 

Rites to Subdue: abhicāra and kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata **301**

The epic’s matter-of-fact treatment of these rites and the different roles in 

which Kuntī performs them point to the cultural-historical contexts of the epic. 

This treatment is grounded in the audience’s common knowledge of the non-hos-

tile use of these rites in domestic contexts. The different versions of the story of Kuntī’s abhicāra point to contestations regarding their legitimacy. The three roles Kuntī assumes when summoning gods address this issue when showing her as \(1\) 

a non-married female suitor, \(2\) a married woman fulfilling her husband’s desire 

for sons, and \(3\) the elder wife who complies with her husband’s request to end 

her co-wife’s childlessness. The first role results in undesirable, unlawful repercussions because the mantras are used in an extra-marital context, while the other two comply with the laws that apply to married women. Normative texts such as the 

Arthaśāstra and Manusmṛti also deal with intra-marital and intra-familial use of abhicāra and love-inducing methods \( saṃvanana\). 

**5  “Domestic” Subjugation Rites **

**in Normative Texts**

The epic treatment of acceptable and non-acceptable methods of controlling others in a domestic setting and the use of terms like abhicāra and saṃvanana resonates with passages in contemporaneous normative texts. Book Four of Kauṭīlya’s 

Arthaśāstra on “the eradication of troublesome people” \( kaṇṭakaśodhana\) contains a chapter on the punishment of transgressions \( aticāra\) which includes the use of kṛtyā and abhicāra. It is stated that a person who uses subduing ritual practices to harm a stranger \( para\) awaits talionic justice: “The damage a person causes for a stranger \( para; or: enemy\) by using malicious contrivances and rites of subjection must be inflicted on him as well” \(KAŚ 4.13.27\).65 However, rites of subjection are allowed in a domestic setting, particularly between husband and wife: “Methods to subject a loved one \( saṃvadanakaraṇam\) can be used at will on an unwilling wife, on a virgin by a suitor, or on the husband by the wife” \(4.13.28\).66 Obviously, the **65**  kṛtyābhicārābhyāṃ yat param āpādayet tad āpādayitavyaḥ // Arthaśāstra 4.13.27. Kangle \(1972, Vol.2:290\) and Olivelle \(2013: 251\) render kṛtyā  and abhicāra as witchcraft and sorcery respectively. 

**66**  kāmaṃ bhāryāyām anicchantyāṃ kanyāyāṃ vā dārārthino bhartari bhāryāyā vā saṃvadanakaraṇam // 4.13.28. The word saṃvadana is according to the text constituted by Kangle; the apparatus shows the reading “saṃvanana”. According to PW and Monier-Williams, s.v. saṃvadana, saṃvadana is a variation of saṃvanana. Drawing on the lexicon of magic, Kangle translates: “The use of loving-magic may be allowed towards a wife who does not like \(her husband\) or towards a maiden by a suitor or towards the husband by the wife” \(Kangle 1972, Vol. 2:290\). Olivelle \(2013:251\) 

**302**

degree to which these practices are transgressive depends on the context. When 

employed in a domestic setting \(or in cases where a male suitor has the assumed 

intention to establish such a setting\) these actions are considered non-hostile and are therefore allowed. Here, it is assumed that the primary intention is not to harm an enemy or stranger but to subject an unwilling spouse \(or virgin\) to conjugal life and thereby ensure “conjugal happiness” \( bhaga\). The distinction between domestic and alien for determining the acceptability of these methods is corroborated 

in another chapter of Book 4. The chapter “On protection against persons with a 

secret income” \( gūḍhajīvanāṃ rakṣā\) mentions methods spies should employ to expose corrupt persons. One of these methods is to hire a saṃvadanakāraka, a person who uses means of subjection to seduce women of the family of another 

man. The spy should unmask such a person as follows: “If he considers anyone as 

a user of occult means for winning love with incantations or rites with herbs and rites in cremation grounds, the secret agent should say to him: ‘I am in love with so and so’s wife, daughter-in-law or daughter; make her reciprocate my love and take this money.’ \(15\) If he were to do so, he should be exiled as a user of occult means for winning love.”67 As in the passage discussed above, these practices are classified as belonging to those who are skilled in kṛtyā  and abhicāra \( kṛtyābhicāraśīla; Arthaśāstra 4.4.16\). The distinction between the employment of the methods of subjection within and without the family is also made in Dharmaśāstra literature. In the Manusmṛti section on kaṇṭakaśodhana \(“eradication of troublesome people”\) it is stated: “For all types of black magic, a fine of 200 should be imposed, as also for root-witchcraft when done by an unrelated person, and for various types of sorcery.”68 The discussion has demonstrated that the appropriateness of Atharvavedic methods of control and subjection in a domestic context depends on the intentions and purposes of the ritual agent, the relationship to the target and the quality of the actual outcome. It resonates with the epic’s negotiating these practices in a literary form. This can also be seen in the use of the subjection mantras being allowed for translates: “Love-inducing rites may be freely used on a disaffected wife, on a young woman by a man who wants to marry her, or on a husband by his wife.” The KAŚ recommends a comparatively mild fine when these practices cause damage \(4.13.29\).

\( upapātaka\). The penance is the cow-observance \(11.109–118\).

male suitors, whereas a female suitor is not mentioned. But a married wife may use them on the husband as much as he may do on her. 

**6 Conclusion**

The discussion of the epic episodes and their connection to contemporaneous 

śāstra literature has highlighted the distinction between hostile and non-hostile, non-familial, and familial contexts for the use of Atharvavedic rites to subdue. A general translation of abhicāra as “sorcery” or “black magic” does not take this distinction into account. Accordingly, a more specific rendering is called for that also covers instances \(like that in the epic\) that represent them as useful and legitimate means to secure domestic peace and happiness. Conversely, the subjugating 

aspects of love-inducing methods called saṃvanana 69 should also be noticed, which explains their being mentioned in connection with abhicāra and mantramūla. On the other hand, the treatment of kṛtyā  consistently stresses its functioning as “malicious agents” to fulfil the hostile intentions of those who ritually produce them. The Atharvaveda addresses needs in a householder’s life before and after the “official” 

performance of saṃskāra rituals. The ‘specialization’ of the Atharvaveda on individual \(and sometimes ‘dark’\) desires and domestic issues is viewed by some scholars as evidence for the marginality of the Atharvaveda as a latecomer in the field of Vedic ritualism. But it must be asked who is it marginal for, and what constitutes the centre. Answers to these questions depend not only on the texts used for tracing the history of reception but also on larger transformations of the religious landscape in the centuries before the beginning of the Common Era. One result of these processes is that the performance of śrauta rites lost its importance as the epitome of Veda-based household religion \(see Smith 1989\). While it is true that the Atharvaveda includes hymns and rituals that aim to harm and even destroy enemies, and 

their effects are regarded as terrible \( ghora, ugra\), they are not generally prohibited but become part of the spectrum of domestic rituals. This is corroborated by the fact that the Atharvaveda provides the template for the composition of texts in which mantras from the Ṛgveda and Sāmaveda are collected for the very same purposes usually ascribed to the Atharvaveda collections.70 Their acceptance depends on purpose and context. It seems that when directed at a “loved” one or companion, **69** See van Buitenen \(1975: 667\). 

**70** See Goudriaan \(1978: 221–252\), who discusses the contexts for the composition of vidhāna-texts, such as Ṛgvidhāna and Sāmavidhāna Brahmaṇa, which teach mantras for abhicāra and saṃvanana practices. He emphasizes the importance of kāmya rites for Vedic ritualism at large.

ritual methods of controlling and subjugating are not prohibited. When looking at the spectrum of paricāra practices depicted in the epic it is obvious that they are not simply the opposite of “hostile” abhicāra rites. Rather paricāra and abhicāra demarcate a spectrum of practices of control acceptable within the household. As 

the case of Kuntī shows, abhicāra may very well become an element of paricāra that can be used in “times of distress”, for instance, such as for the benefit of rivaling co-wives. The various verbal compounds with √ car seem to circumscribe a socio-ritual field of practice \( paricāra, upacāra, abhicāra\) that focuses on coping with asymmetrical power relations that are framed as operating in hierarchies of 

mutual dependence. The account in Book 13 that depicts women as being created 

as experts in household politics and as kṛtyās whose task is to hinder men from obtaining god-like status interprets these asymmetrical power relations in a cosmological framework. In this way, it gives an additional justification for the normative order of patrilineal kinship structures women are subjected to. The clear 

positioning of kṛtyā  in the field of hostile acts and agents stands in contrast with the polyvalence of abhicāra practices. The usefulness and acceptance of abhicāra apply particularly to situations of distress and familial or conjugal tensions and point to a connection between these practices and rites of pacification \( śānti-karman\) that are in later literature classified as belonging to the same branch of ritual practices.71 Seen from this perspective, paricāra and abhicāra are not so much opposites but counterparts, and the Mahābhārata can be viewed as exploring and negotiating 

this spectrum in a literary form.
