**And I Will Fix You****: A ‘Chariot-simile’ **

**in PS 4.15.6–7, ŚS 4.12.6–7**

**Abstract:** In this paper, I focus on the chariot-simile of PS 4.15.6–7 \(= ŚS 4.12.6–7\): in this passage, the healer is compared to a craftsman \(R̥bhu\), his patient to a broken wagon. To reconstruct the disiecta membra  of the metaphor, I focus on the phraseology applying to the R̥bhus in the Rigveda. The verb takṣ ‘to fashion’ occasionally describes ‘rejuvenations’ effected by these gods and the Aśvins, healer deities of the Vedic pantheon. Moreover, I show that the metaphorical conceptions of the human 

body in terms of a chariot is widely attested in other Indo-European languages, 

where names of chariot parts are identical to those of the parts of the human body. 

I finally propose that the chariot-metaphor underlies the poetic expression τέκτων 

νωδυνίας ‘fashioner of painlessness’, a kenning referred to the healer Asclepius in Pindar’s Pythian Three. 

1. In this paper, I investigate the Vedic background of the chariot-simile attested in PS 4.15.6–7 \(cf. ŚS 4.12.6–7\). In this passage, the healer of a fracture is compared to a craftsman, a R̥bhu, while his patient is compared to a broken vehicle. First of all, my phraseological analysis will focus on the description of the R̥bhus’ work in the Rigveda. Such a study aims at highlighting how Vedic takṣ ‘to fashion’ describes the divine work of the R̥bhus as creators of things. Moreover, the paper aims at providing an Indo-European thematic comparandum for the metaphor of the healer 

as ‘fashioner’. In this regard, I propose that the poetic expression τέκτων νωδυνίας 

‘fashioner of painlessness’ \(Asclepius, in Pindar’s Pythian 3\), reflects a similar state of things as the Atharvavedic passage. The comparison between Pindar Pythian 

3.47–53 and ŚS 4.12.6–7 will reveal further thematic matches: the patients of the **Note:** This paper is based on a talk given at the conference The Atharvaveda and its South Asian Contexts.

Greek healer and those of the Vedic one appear to have been hurt in a similar way. 

Finally, the expression ‘to stand upright’ applies to the response to the treatment performed by the healers in Greece and India. 

2. The Paippalādasaṃhitā \(PS\) hymn 4.15 is a charm to heal open fractures. It parallels the Śaunakasaṃhitā \(ŚS\) hymn 4.12—PS 4.15.1–5 are indeed identical to ŚS 

4.12.1–5—, whose central stanzas \(3–5\) have long been compared to the Old High 

German second Merseburg spell from a phraseological point of view1 and to the 

Irish Cath Maige Tuired §33–35, from a thematic point of view.2 In stanza 6 of PS 

4.15, the work of the healer is directly compared to that of a R̥bhu, while his patient is said to resemble a chariot. The passage in question reads as follows:

PS 4.15.6 \(only PS ♢ b\+d: cf. ŚS 4.12.7a\+cd\)3

yadi vajro visr̥ṣṭas tu vāāra

✶ kāṭaṃ patitvā yadi vā viriṣṭam

vr̥kṣād vā yad avasad daśaśīrṣa

\+ **r̥bhū rathasyeva **saṃ dadhāmi te paruḥ

‘If a vajra that has been hurled has hit you, or if there is an injury due to falling into a well \(?\), or one that is there \[due to falling\] from a tree: the ten-headed one shall remove \[it\]. I put together your joint **as R̥bhu \[the parts\] of a chariot**.’4

The reference to the R̥bhu as a term of comparison for the healer’s skill is unsurprising and, to be sure, not unparalleled.5 Indeed, in early Vedic texts, the R̥bhu is often referred to as a touchstone for the creativity of masters in any field:

RV 6.3.8cd 

śárdho vā yó marútāaṃ **tatákṣa**, **r̥bhúr ná** tveṣó rabhasānó adyaut

‘Or who **fashioned** the troop of Maruts **like a R̥bhu**, he, turbulent and wild, has flashed.’

**1** Kuhn 1864. 

**2** Krause 1930: 32; Campanile 1990; Watkins 1995: 523–532. One can also add the comparison with the Tocharian text “The Craftsmen and the Lion” \(THT 644–646 a11–13, cf. also Pañcatantra  5.3\), now discussed by Serangeli \(2022\) and Massetti \(forthc./b\). 

**3** ŚS 4.12.7 yádi kartáṃ patitvā́ saṃśaśré yádi vā́śmā práhr̥to jaghā́na / r̥bhū́ ráthasyevā́ṅgāni sáṃ 

dadhat páruṣā páruḥ.  

**4** Differently, Bhattacharya \(2008\) reads yadi vajro visr̥ṣṭas tvāra kāṭāt, patitvā yadi vā viriṣṭam / 

vr̥kṣād vā yad avasad daśaśīrṣa, \+ r̥bhū rathasyeva saṃ dadhāmi te paruḥ, and translates \(p. 132\) ‘if a thunderbolt, loosened, has moved towards you, and then falling into a pit if there is injury, or \(by falling\) from a tree \(there is injury\), that the ten headed genie has relieved, I put together your joint as R̥bhu \[the parts\] of a chariot.’

And I Will Fix You: A ‘Chariot-simile’ in PS 4.15.6–7, ŚS 4.12.6–7

RV 10.105.6 prā́staud r̥ṣvaújā r̥ṣvébhis, **tatákṣa** śū́raḥ śávasā

** **

**r̥bhúr ná **krátubhir mātaríśvā

‘He of lofty might has struck up the praise song with the lofty ones. The champion **fashioned** it with his swelling strength, **like an artisan \[R̥bhu\]** in accord with his intentions, \(like?\) Mātariśvan. ’

All the aforementioned similes rely upon the Rigvedic descriptions of the R̥bhus,6 

a group of three deities, who are identified as skillful craftsmen.7 Since they are the fashioners par excellence, their deeds are mostly described through Vedic takṣ 

‘to fashion’ \(Indo-European ✶ tetƙ- ‘id.’, cf. Old Avestan tašat̰ ‘he built’, Lithuanian tašau, tašyti ‘to smooth, work’, Greek τέκτων ‘fashioner’, τεκταίνομαι ‘to fashion’\).8 

The association between Vedic takṣ  and the R̥bhus must have been perceived as a distinctive trait of their divine personality. Indeed, the verb was not only applied to the R̥bhus’ major accomplishments \(see below\), but it also came to refer to 

their doing in a variety of metaphoric contexts. Take, for instance, the invocation 

\[fashion – X\], where ‘X’ may stand for the sacrifice \(RV 3.54.12d ūrdhvágrāvāṇo adhvarám ataṣṭa ‘with pressing stones raised, you have fashioned the ceremony’\); wealth \(RV 4.33.8c tá ā́ takṣantuv r̥bhávo rayíṃ naḥ ‘let these R̥bhus fashion wealth for us’\); fame \(RV 4.36.9b ihá śrávo vīrávat takṣatā naḥ ‘Fashion here for us the fame that heroes accompany’\)9 and poetry \(RV 10.80.7a agnáye bráhma r̥bhávas tatakṣuḥ ‘For Agni did the R̥bhus fashion their formulation’\).10

Furthermore, the Rigveda often makes reference to the fact the R̥bhus have attained immortality \(e.g., RV 4.33.4d tā́bhiḥ śámībhir amr̥tatvám āśuḥ ‘they attained **6** On the R̥bhus as craftsmen see Hillebrandt 1891: 515; MacDonell 1897: 131–134; Ryder 1901; Oldenberg 1917: 239–240; Keith 1925: 176–178, Kramrisch 1959; Gonda 1960–1964: 72, Oberlies 2012: 157–158; Brereton 2012, with special focus on the ritual dimension of the R̥bhus and their connection with the Third Soma Pressing. 

**7** The other prominent craftsman deity of the Rigveda  is Tvaṣṭar, on whom cf. MacDonell 1897: 116–117. Just like the achievements of the R̥bhus, those of Tvaṣṭar are also described by means of Vedic takṣ ‘to fashion’. However, the R̥bhus and Tvaṣṭar fashion different things. Among other things, Tvaṣṭar, who is associated with fertility, fashions babies in women’s wombs. On R̥bhus and Tvaṣṭar cf. Massetti \(forthc./b\). 

**8** On the IE root see Bendahman 1993: 246–247. On the etymology of Hittite takš- ‘to unite \[harmo-niously\], to fit together’, takšan ‘jointly, together’ cf. Melchert 2018, who reconstructs a root ✶ teƙ-s-, which also underlies Latin texere.

‘strophe’ see Darmesteter 1878, Schmitt 1967: 14–15; Nagy 2006; Massetti 2019: 192–194. For ‘to join words together’ \(ἐξ ἐπέων . . . οἷα . . . ἅρμοσαν\) and the name of Homer as ‘the one who joins the words together’ see Nagy 2006.

immortality by these labors’\) after performing five great creative deeds: \(a\) the fashioning/carving of four cups from Tvaṣṭar’s soma cup; \(b\) the making of a 

chariot, which is sometimes identified as the Aśvins’ chariot; \(c\) the creation of a milk-cow and \(d\) of Indra’s two fallow bay horses; \(e\) the rejuvenation of their aging parents:11

– Achievements \(b\), \(c\):

RV 1.20.3 

**tákṣan **nā́satiyābhiyām, párijmānaṃ sukháṃ** rátham**

** **

**tákṣan dhenúṃ **sabardúghām

**‘They fashioned** for the Nāsatyas an earth-circling, well-naved **chariot**; **they fashioned** the juice-yielding **milk-cow**.’12

– Achievements \(b\), \(d\), \(e\), \(c\):

RV 1.111.1 

**tákṣan ráthaṃ** suvŕ̥taṃ vidmanā́pasas, **tákṣan hárī** indravā́hā vŕ̥ṣaṇvasū

** **

** tákṣan** **pitŕ̥bhyām r̥bhávo** **yúvad váyas**, **tákṣan** vatsā́ya **mātáraṃ** sacā-bhúvam 

**‘They fashioned the** smooth-rolling **chariot, **13 working with their know-how; **they fashioned** **the** two fallow **bays** that convey Indra and bring bullish goods.14 **They fashioned—**

**the R̥bhus—for their parents youthful vigor**; **they fashioned** for the calf **a mother** to stay by it.’15

Although the Rigveda does not make reference to the R̥bhus’ medical skill\(s\), verbal allusions to achievement \(e\) \(: rejuvenation of their parents, see RV 1.111.1c tákṣan pitŕ̥bhyām r̥bhávo yúvad váyaḥ ‘they fashioned—the R̥bhus—for their parents youthful vigor’\) deserve close consideration, since this miraculous deed may 

involve a healing process. In most of the texts, the rejuvenation is described by means of the expressions \[ púnaḥ – kar\] or \[ púnaḥ – takṣ\] ‘to fashion \[young\] again/

to fashion back’, see RV 1.20.4 yúvānā pitárā púnaḥ, satyámantrā r̥jūyávaḥ / r̥bhávo viṣṭíy àkrata ‘They whose mantras come true, who aim straight—the R̥bhus—made **11** Achievement \(a\) is often described by means of other Vedic verbs, such as kar ‘to make’ \(RV 

4.33.5, 4.35.2, 3\), and peś ‘to carve’ \(RV 3.60.2\). The latter also describes achievement \(c\), cf. RV 

1.110.8, 1.161.10, 4.36.4. 

**12** ‘Sie zimmerten den beiden Nāsatyas \(Aśvins\) den ringsherum befindlichen Streitwagen mit gut \(geschmierten\) Nabenlöchern / sie zimmerten die Milchkuh Sabardughā.’ \(Witzel – Gotō 2007: 36, for sabardughā as ‘etwa ›die saftig milchende‹’ and bibliographical references see p. 507\). 

**13** For the collocation \[ takṣ – chariot\] cf. RV 1.130.6, 5.2.11b, 5.29.15, 5.31.4, 5.73.10 \(formulations/

chariot\), 10.39.14b. 

**14** Scarlata \(1999: 474\): ‘die zwei Falben, die den Indra fahren \{und\} soviel wert wie Stiere sind \(?\).’

**15** ‘Sie haben den gutrollenden Streitwagen \(der Aśvins\) mit Kenntnis vom Werk gezimmert. Sie haben das Falbenpaar, das den Indra fährt, das den Stier als \(Lade\)gut hat, gezimmert. Sie haben, die R̥bhus, ihren Eltern Jugendkraft gezimmert. Sie haben dem Kalb eine begleitende Mutter gezimmert.’ \(Witzel – Gotō 2007: 195\).

their parents young again through their toil.’16 In a slightly expanded version of the collocation, the R̥bhus are said to have fashioned their parents young again so that they could keep going \(Vedic caráthāya\):

RV 4.36.3cd 

jívrī yát sántā pitárā sanājúrā, **púnar** **yúvānā** **caráthāya** **tákṣatha**

‘ . . . that you **fashion** your **parents** as **youths** **for them to keep going**, even though they were enfeebled, worn out by age.’

A similar phraseology occurs in connection with a miraculous deed performed by 

the Aśvins:

RV 1.117.13ab 

yuváṃ cyávānam aśvinā járantam

** púnar** **yúvānaṃ cakrathuḥ** śácībhiḥ

‘You, o Aśvins, **made** the aging Cyavāna **a youth again** through your powers.’

This match is significant, because, as it is well known, the Twin-gods are associated with rescuing and healing. In particular, RV 1.117.13, quoted immediately above, 

alludes to the myth of the rejuvenation of Cyavāna,17 which is told in extenso  in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa \(3.120–128\), the Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa \(4.1.5\), in the Mahābhārata \(3.121.20–125.10\) as well as in the Devībhāgavata \(7.2.30–7.43\) and Bhāgavata Purāṇa s \(9.3.1–28\). Cyavāna’s rejuvenation is compared to several concrete actions in the Rigveda, such as the removing of a garment \(e.g. RV 1.116.10ab jujurúṣo nāsatyotá vavrím, prā́muñcataṃ drāpím iva cyávānāt ‘and, Nāsatyas, from Cyavāna, who had become old, you removed his covering \[=aged skin\] like a garment’\).18 But significantly, in a passage from the tenth book, the Aśvins are directly compared to carpenters:

**16** ‘Die \(R̥bhus\) haben die Eltern \(wieder\) jung gemacht, deren Sprüche Wahrheit enthalten, die recht wandelnden \(R̥bhus\), durch ihre Dienstleistung.’ \(Witzel – Gotō 2007: 36\). See also RV 

1.110.8d, 1.161.3, 7; 4.33.2–3, 4.35.5ab always with kar. 

**17** Cyavāna, whose name is an aequabile of the Greek male personal name Σύμενος \(Rhodes, Athens, see García Ramón 1999\), is a r̥ṣi who is rejuvenated by the Aśvins. For the narrative evolution of Cyavāna’s legend, see Witzel 1987 and West 2017. 

**18** Cf. also RV 5.74.5ab prá cyávānāj jujurúṣo vavrím átkaṃ ná muñcathaḥ ‘you remove the covering like a cloak from Cyavāna, who had become old.’ In post-Vedic literature, the image of ‘wearing new garments’ describes the process of rebirth, cf. Bhagavad Gītā 2.22 vāsāṃsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya navāni gr̥hṇāti naro ’parāṇi / tathā śarīrāṇi vihāya jīrṇānyanyāni saṃyāti navāni dehī ‘just as a man casts off his worn-out clothes and puts on other new ones, so the embodied soul casts off its worn-out bodies and takes new ones’ \(Cherniak 2008\).

Laura Massetti

RV 10.39.4ab 

yuváṃ cyávānaṃ sanáyaṃ yáthā rátham, **púnar** **yúvānaṃ caráthāya** 

**takṣathuḥ**

‘You two \(Aśvins\)** fashioned **old** Cyavāna**, like a chariot, into a youth **again**, \(for him\) **to move** **about. **’

The comparison between the collocations occurring in the R̥bhus-passages and in 

the Aśvins-passage is remarkable: RV 1.20.4, 4.36.3, and 10.39.4 contain a collocation \[to make/fashion \(Vedic kar  or  takṣ\) – X – young – again – \(to keep going\)\]: yúvānā . . . púnaḥ . . . άkrata \(RV 1.20.4 etc., R̥bhus\)

púnar yúvānā caráthāya tákṣatha \(RV 4.36.3cd, R̥bhus\) púnar yúvānaṃ caráthāya takṣathuḥ \(RV 10.39.4b, Aśvins\)

While all passages preserve ‘to make/fashion \(Vedic kar  or  takṣ\) X young again’ 

with an optional dative of purpose \( caráthāya\), ‘to keep going’, as the standard collocation for ‘rejuvenating’, RV 10.39.4 \(: the Aśvins-passage\) adds ‘like a chariot’ 

\( yáthā rátham\) in pāda a, creating a simile with the comparanda. 

In light of all these collocations, RV 1.111.1c \( tákṣan pitŕ̥bhyām r̥bhávo yúvad váyaḥ ‘they fashioned – the R̥bhus—for their parents youthful vigor’\) may make reference to the same episode: when the R̥bhus rejuvenated their parents, they 

fixed  them \( púnaḥ . . . kar/ takṣ\), by fashioning \( takṣ\) new vigor. From the examples in which takṣ  applies to the healer-gods, it is clear that the verb does imply both the notion of ‘fashioning back’, i.e., ‘fixing, renewing’, and that of ‘production/creation’, just like τέκτων or τεκταίνομαι in Greek \(see below, §4\). 

3. In order to clarify the metaphor ‘healer’: ‘carpenter’, it is useful to take into account the complementary metaphor ‘body’: ‘chariot’, which is directly attested in PS 4.15.719 and elsewhere:

PS 4.15.7 

ut tiṣṭha prehi sam ✶ adhāyi te paruḥ



saṃ te dhātā dadhātu tanvo viriṣṭam

** **

**rathaḥ sucakraḥ supavir yathaiti**

** **

**sukhaḥ sunābhiḥ prati tiṣṭha evam**

‘Stand up, go forth, your joint has been put together. Let Dhātar put together the injury of your body. **Be steady in this way, as a chariot goes with good wheels, with good felloes,** **with good axle-holes, with good naves**.’20

This metaphor is not a mere poetic topos, it reflects a widespread conception in India, Greece and beyond. As the dossiers collected by Pinault \(2003: 138–140\) and **19** Cf. ŚS 4.12.6 sá út tiṣṭha préhi prá drava ráthaḥ sucakráḥ / supavíḥ sunā́bhiḥ práti tiṣṭhordhváḥ. 

**20** Bhattacharya \(2008: 135\) instead reads \(pāda a\): ut tiṣṭha prehi sam u dhāyi te paruḥ ‘ Stand up, go forth, your joint is, indeed, put together.’

And I Will Fix You: A ‘Chariot-simile’ in PS 4.15.6–7, ŚS 4.12.6–7 

[[107]]

Jamison \(1987: 71–88\) have made evident, the semantic field of ‘body parts’ crosses with that of ‘chariot’ and viceversa in at least three Indo-European languages: Old Indic, Greek, and Tocharian.21 In Vedic, some parts of the chariot are designated through a compound or a simplex noun, which usually denotes a body part: Vedic 

ratha-mukhá- ‘front part of a chariot’ \(AV, JB, TS\), ratha-śīrṣá- ‘id.’ \(ŚB 9.4.1.13\), and ratha- śiras- ‘id.’ \(ĀpŚS 17.20.5\) contain terms for ‘head’ as their second compound members, viz. mukhá-, śīrṣán-, and  śíras-; Vedic nā́bhi- \(RV\+\) ‘nave’ and nā́bhya- 

\(RV\+\) ‘central part of a solid wheel’ are etymologically related to Gk. ὀμφαλός, 

meaning both ‘navel’ and ‘knob in the middle of a yoke’ \( Iliad 24.273, mule-cart\); Vedic kakṣyā́- ‘girth’ \(RV\) and kákṣa- \(RV\+\) ‘Achselhöhle’ \(Hoffmann 1966: 201\) are connected to both Young Avestan kaša- ‘id.’ and Latin coxa ‘hip’, Old Irish coss ‘foot’; Vedic kukṣī́- ‘nave’ \(Sparreboom 1985: 157\) also means ‘cheek’, ‘buttock’ \(Jamison 1987, Bodewitz 1992\);22 Vedic áṃsa- ‘panel which fitted into the rail at the top and the big beams at each side of the platform’ \(cf. Sparreboom 1985: 152\) also means 

‘shoulder’ \(Höfler 2018\) and is etymologically related to Greek ὦμος, Tocharian A es, Tocharian B  āntse ‘shoulders’; Vedic ákṣa- ‘axle’ is a genetic cognate of Latin axis, Lithuanian ašìs, Greek ἄξων ‘axis’ and ‘shoulder span’; Vedic āṇí- ‘axle-pin’ \(RV\) also denotes ‘the part of the leg above the knee’ and may be connected to Tocharian B oñi- ‘hip’.23

To sum up: the phraseological analysis shows that stanzas 6 and 7 of PS 4.15 

make reference to a robustly attested metaphor. Accordingly, a healer or a bone-

setter can be compared to the R̥bhu \( r̥bhū rathasyeva saṃ dadhāmi te paruḥ ‘I put together your joint as R̥bhu \[the parts\] of a chariot’, PS 4.15.6d\), who is the fashioner \(Vedic takṣ\)  par excellence. In particular, Vedic takṣ applies to the rejuvenation of aging parents by the R̥bhus \(RV 4.36.3d, see §2\) and of Cyavāna by the Aśvins \(RV 

10.39.4ab cyávānaṃ . . . yáthā rátham, púnar yúvānaṃ caráthāya takṣathuḥ ‘You fashioned . . . Cyavāna, like a chariot, into a youth again, \(for him\) to move about’\). 

The presented data help us to understand the metaphor attested in PS 4.15.7: the 

human body can be fixed back/rejuvenated like a broken wagon, because the 

chariot parts are described through the lexicon of body parts and viceversa. 

**21** Cf. also Johnson \(1987\) for further metaphors involving the body in modern languages. 

**22** Cf. also Greek κνήμη ‘leg, shank’ \(Homer\+\), and ‘spoke’ \(Pollux Grammaticus\), cf. κύκλα . . . 

ὀκτάκημα \( Iliad  5.722–723\). 

**23** A further West Tocharian parallel shall be brought out here: T5a8 kwreṃntär lānte kokalyi ol-yapotstse pärsāñci | taik\[n\]esāk ra kektseñi kätsai\[ ññe\] \[sic\] \[ yänmāskeṃ\] ‘Old \[even\] grow the chariots of the king, the very splendid ones. Thus also the bodies reach old age’ \(CEToM, see also Adams 2012 s.v. taiknesa\), which translates Sanskrit Udānavarga 1.28 jīryanti vai rāja rathāḥ su-citrā hy atho śarīram api jarām upaiti.  The same metaphor also occurs in T5b2; for a discussion of this passage cf. Massetti \(forthc./b\).

4. The system of metaphors underlying PS 4.15.6–7 is thus well founded in Vedic. In order to seek parallels for it in at least another branch of the Indo-European linguistic family, I will now turn to the analysis of a Pindaric passage, which might conceal a chariot metaphor in connection with a healer, namely: Pindar’s Pythian 3.1–7:24

Pindar Pythian 3.1–7 

Ἤθελον Χίρωνά κε Φιλλυρίδαν, 



εἰ χρεὼν τοῦθ᾽ ἁμετέρας ἀπὸ γλώσσας





κοινὸν εὔξασθαι ἔπος, 



ζώειν τὸν ἀποιχόμενον, 



Οὐρανίδα γόνον εὐρυμέδοντα Κρόνου, 





βάσσαισί τ᾽ ἄρχειν Παλίου φῆρ᾽ ἀγρότερον, 



νόον ἔχοντ᾽ ἀνδρῶν φίλον· οἷος ἐὼν θρέψεν ποτέ

****

**τέκτονα νωδυνίας**





ἥμερον γυιαρκέος Ἀσκλαπιόν, 



ἥροα παντοδαπᾶν ἀλκτῆρα νούσων

‘I wish that Chiron—if it is right for my tongue to utter that common prayer—were still living, the departed son of Philyra and wide-ruling offspring of Uranus’ son Cronus, and still reigned in Pelion’s glades, that wild creature who had a mind friendly to men. I would have him be as he was when he once reared the gentle **craftsman** **of** body-strengthening **relief from pain **

**\[LM: ‘painlessness’\]**, Asclepius, the hero and protector from diseases of all sorts.’25

The collocation τέκτονα νωδυνίας,26 with τέκτων from IE ✶ tetƙ- ‘to fashion’, cf. 

Vedic takṣ ‘id.’, stands out as nearly unparalleled within the Greek repertory of poetic images.27 Τhe uniqueness and the metaphorical potential of this collocation **24** The ode celebrates Hieron of Syracuse, who was critically ill at time of composition.

**26** The term νωδυνία, as well as the adjective νώδυνος \(Pindar Nemean  8.50\+\), first occur in Pindar. 

The etymology of these compounds is transparent: their first compound member goes back to the negative prefix ✶ n̥-, while the second member\(s\) are related to Greek ὀδύνη ‘pain’, Aeolian ἐδύνη 

✶‘\(biting\) pain’, cf. Proto-Indo-European ✶ h1ed- ‘\(to bite\), to eat’, Armenian erkn ‘birth labor’, Irish idu ‘pain’, as pointed out by Schindler 1975. 

**27** The pair τέκτονα νωδυνίας . . . ἀλκτῆρα νούσων might apparently recall Iliad 10.19–20: εἴ τινά 

οἱ σὺν μῆτιν ἀμύμονα τεκτήναιτο, / ἥ τις ἀλξίκακος πᾶσιν Δαναοῖσι γένοιτο ‘in the hope that he \(: Nestor\) might contrive with him \(: Agamemnon\) some incomparable device that would serve to ward off evil from all the Danaans.’ Even if Pindar’s words preserve a dimly epic phraseological memory, the iuncturae  clearly apply to different situations. In the Homeric passage, Agamemnon hopes that Nestor might find the solution to the partiality that Zeus shows towards Hector \(on Iliad 10.1–52 and the nature of Nestor’s μῆτις \(‘plan’\) see Dué – Ebbott 2010: III 10.19ff., Nagy 2016, on vv. 

10.43–52\). Differently, Pindar refers to Asclepius as the contriver of health and protection against illnesses. Parallels between healers and craftsmen are then found in Plato \( Grg.  503e–504a, Cra.  

416d, Prt.  345a, Ion  537c, spuria 376d, 390c, 454d\); cf. also Arist. De an.  403b, Top.  116a.

originate from the fact that Greek τέκτων, primarily denotes a ‘carpenter’, i.e., a 

‘fashioner of objects’, see, e.g.:

Iliad 6.315–316 

ἦσαν ἐνὶ Τροίῃ ἐριβώλακι **τέκτονες** ἄνδρες, 

οἵ οἱ ἐποίησαν θάλαμον καὶ δῶμα καὶ αὐλήν

‘. . . Men who were at that time the best **builders** in deep-soiled Troy; they had made him a chamber and hall and courtyard.’

Homeric Hymn 5.12–13 

Πρώτη **τέκτονας** ἄνδρας ἐπιχθονίους ἐδίδαξε

ποιῆσαι 

**σατίνας** καὶ **ἅρματα **ποικίλα χαλκῷ

‘She \(: Athena\) first taught earthly **craftsmen** to make **chariots of war and cars** variously wrought with bronze.’

Obviously, τέκτων ‘fashioner’ came to be used metaphorically in Greek, in order to designate ‘a master in any art’ \(LSJ s.v. τέκτων, 2\), see POxy. 2389, fr. 9.8–10 τέκτονι 

παρθενίων ‘to the craftsman of the parthenia’,28 Pindar Nemean 5.49 χρὴ δ᾽ ἀπ᾽ 

Ἀθανᾶν τέκτον᾽ ἀθληταῖσιν ἔμμεν ‘a fashioner of athletes ought to be from Athens’; Pindar Pythian 3.113–114 ἐξ ἐπέων κελαδεννῶν, τέκτονες οἷα σοφοί || ἅρμοσαν 

‘from such echoing verses as wise craftsmen joined \(them together\)’ \(modified 

translation Massetti\); and a ‘maker’, ‘creator’, e.g., Aeschylus Supplices 592–594 

αὐτὸς ὁ πατὴρ φυτουργὸς αὐτόχειρ ἄναξ || γένους παλαιόφρων μέγας || τέκτων, 

‘the father \(: Zeus\) is that, the lord, who planted our clan of his own hand, the great creator of our kin, who has the wisdom of age’. In order to reconstruct the process that led to the metaphorical use of τέκτων in Pindar’s Pythian 3, let us focus on the structure of τέκτων νωδυνίας. 

I propose to interpret this nominal syntagma \[Anoun – of Bnoun\] as a substitution kenning \(type i, see below\). A kenning is a compact and complicated, riddling metaphor. It has been defined as “a bipartite figure of two nouns in a non-copulative, typically genitival grammatical relation \(A of B\) or in composition \(B-A/A-B\) which together make reference to, ‘signify’ a third notion C” \(Watkins 1995: 44\).29 According to the standard view \(Mittner 1954: 15\), two main types of kenningar can be 

identified within different Indo-European languages:

i. The substitution kenning replaces one term in the poetic discourse, and can therefore be schematized as \[A\+B\] → \[C\]. For instance, in Reginsmál  16, mun-at vágmarar vind um standask ‘the sea-steeds \(=the ships\) will not withstand the wind’, the kenning vágmarar ‘sea-steeds’ directly substitutes ‘ships’. 

ii. The variation kenning is juxtaposed to the term it refers to, as iteration, apposition, epithet etc., and can be schematized as \[A\+B\] – \[C\]. For instance, in Homer, **28** On the possible attribution of the passage to Pindar, see Recchia 2017.

Odyssey 4.708–709, νηῶν ὠκυπόρων || ἐπιβαινέµεν, αἵ θ᾽ ἁλὸς ἵπποι ἀνδράσι 

γίγνονται ‘\(he had no need\) to go on board of swift-faring ships, which are for 

the men as horses of the sea’, ‘ships’ \(gen. νηῶν\) is followed by the poetic simile 

‘horses of the seas’ \(ἁλὸς ἵπποι\). 

The provided examples can be enlightening for the distribution of the kenningar 

in Greek, especially in comparison to the distributional patterns found in other 

Indo-European languages: as observed by Campanile \(1977: 108–122\), the substitu-

tion type \(i\) is less well attested in Greek than the variation type \(ii\).30 The following Pindaric examples of kenningar, paralleling those found in other Indo-European 

languages, partially confirm Campanile’s analysis:

– \[war/battle\]: \[\(devastating\) shower/tempest – zeusgen.\], occurs as a type \(ii\) 

in Pindar. It can be compared to Latin ferreus imber ‘iron-shower’ \(: battle, Ennius Annales 266 Skutsch; cf. also Vergil Aeneid  12.284\), and Old English þone ðe oft gebad isernscure ‘\(the warrior\) who often passed through the iron-shower’ \( Beowulf 3116\):31

‘in war . . . **during** **Zeus’ devastating rain**, that hailstorm of gore for countless men.’32

– \[rain\(s\)\]: \[child\(ren\) – cloudgen.\] occurs as a type \(ii\) in Pindar. It recalls Vedic mihó nápāt-, ‘child of the mist’, a substitution kenning \(type \[i\]\) for ‘cloud’ or ‘rain’, cf. tyáṃ cid ghā dīrghám pr̥thúm, mihó nápātam ámr̥dhram / prá cyāvayanti yā́mabhiḥ ‘also this child of mist – long, wide, not negligible \(in size\) – do they \(: the Maruts\) stir forth with their journeys’ \(RV 1.37.11\):33

take the ‘child of mist’ to be the rain, its physical description here \(‘long and wide’\) makes better sense for a cloud.” The Maruts are often associated with both clouds and rain \(MacDonell 1897: 79–80; Oberlies 2012: 153\), cf. their epithet varṣánirṇijaḥ ‘having a cloak of rain’ \(RV 5.57.4a\). At RV 

5.32.4b Indra is the mihó nápāt-.

– \[X \(=warrior/king\)\]: \[bastion/pillar/bulwark – communitygen.\]34 occurs as a variation type in Irish, see Moryen mur trin ‘Morien, bulwark of the battle’ \( Cyvoesi Myrddin 121\), and as a substitution type in Old English, see biddan wille, / eodor Scyldinga ‘I want to ask you \(a favor\), enclosure of the Scyldings \(:chief of the Danes\)’ \( Beowulf  427–428\), and may actually be considered a mixed type in Greek. 

In both Pindar Olympian  2.81–82 and Paean 4.83–85, the kenning has a grammatical referent. However, from a semantic point of view, the tropos stands for \[the strongest warrior \(Hector in Olympian 2, Achilles in Paean 4\)\]:

Pindar Olympian 2.81–82 

ὃς **Ἕκτορα** σφᾶλε, **Τροίας**



ἄμαχον ἀστραβῆ **κίονα **\[. . .\]

‘He laid low **Hector**, **Troy’s** invincible **pillar** of strength.’35

Pindar Paean 4.83–85 

κυανοπλόκοιο **παῖδα** **ποντίας**

**Θέτιος** βιατάν, 

πιστὸν 

**ἕρκος** **Ἀχαιῶν**

‘The powerful **son** **of** the dark-haired sea-goddess **Thetis**, the trusty **bastion** **of the Achaeans**.’

Back to Pindar Pythian 3.6: I propose that, just like \[warrior\]: \[bastion/pillar of group\] τέκτων νωδυνίας is another example of a ‘mixed type’. It grammatically 

refers to Asclepius, cf. τέκτονα νωδυνίας . . . Ἀσκλαπιόν, so, according to Mittner’s classification, it should be understood as type ii \(variation kenning\). Nevertheless, the taking into account of the synchronic  evidence, i.e. internal Greek textual elements, indicates that ‘craftsman of the painlessness’ is a substitution kenning for 

‘healer’ \(type i\). Two main facts support this assumption:

i. According to ancient Pindaric commentators, τέκτων νωδυνίας meant ‘physi-

cian’, see Scholium in Pindar Pythian 3.11a.1 Drachmann **τέκτονα νωδυνίας**· 

τὸν κατασκευαστὴν τῆς νωδυνίας· **ἰατρὸς** γάρ ‘**craftsman of the painless-**

**ness**: the contriver of painlessness, for \(it means\) a **physician**’. 

ii. The lexical repetitions between the first and the central part of the ode might suggest that τέκτων νωδυνίας actually corresponds to ἰατήρ:36

Pindar Pythian 3.63–67 

εἰ δὲ σώφρων ἄντρον ἔναι᾽ ἔτι **Χίρων**, καί τί οἱ



φίλτρον <ἐν> θυμῷ μελιγάρυες ὕμνοι



ἁμέτεροι τίθεν, **ἰατῆρά** τοί κέν νιν πίθον



καί νυν ἐσλοῖσι παρασχεῖν ἀνδράσιν θερμᾶν **νόσων**



ἤ τινα Λατοΐδα κεκλημένον ἢ πατέρος

**34** Schmitt 1967: 282–283; Campanile 1977: 120–121. As a more recent reference see West 2007: 454–455. 

**35** Cf. \[πῦργος – community/city\]: Iliad 4.334, Pindar Pythian 5.56. 

**36** τέκτων νωδυνίας forms a lexical repetition with ἐξ ἐπέων . . . τέκτονες \(v. 113\). On the ring-composition and its Vedic comparandum, RV 10.39, cf. Massetti \(forthc./b\).

‘Yet if wise **Chiron** were still living in his cave, and if my honey-sounding hymns could put a charm in his heart, I would surely have persuaded him to provide **a healer** now as well to cure the feverish **illnesses** of good men, someone called a son of a Apollo or of Zeus.’

The set of lexical repetitions can be shortly presented as follows: Χίρωνα \(v. 1\) parallels Χίρων \(v. 63\), νούσων \(v. 7\) parallels νόσων \(v. 66\), τέκτονα νωδυνίας \(v. 6\) parallels ἰατῆρα \(v. 65\)

**Table 1:** Lexical repetitions of Pindar’s Pythian 3, vv. 1–7, 63–67. 

v. 1 Χίρωνα

v. 63** **Χίρων

v. 6 **τέκτονα** **νωδυνίας **v. 65 **ἰατῆρα**

v. 7 νούσων

v. 67 νόσων

We can conclude: The image of the ‘craftsman of the painlessness’ is practically 

isolated in Greek literature. From the point of view of its synchronic meaning, the collocation may be interpreted as a substitution kenning for ‘physician’. By combining the Greek and the Vedic phraseological data, it is possible to recover a verbal link between healers and carpenters, namely: the metaphoric use of IE ✶ tetƙ- ‘to fashion’. If the Vedic healer is compared to the R̥bhu, who is the fashioner \(Vedic takṣ\)  par excellence, Asclepius, the best healer, is directly called ‘fashioner of painlessness’ \(Greek τέκτονα νωδυνίας\). 

5. A further look to the Atharvavedic contexts and to Pindar’s Pythian  3 reveals that the thematic and phraseological matches between these two texts may go beyond 

the metaphor ‘healer’: ‘carpenter’. In this regard, the use of the collocation ‘to stand upright’ has to be highlighted. Although Vedic \[ ūrdhvá- – sthā\] and Greek \[ὀρθός – 

ἵστημι\] are documented in a variety of contexts,37 the collocations denote the full recovery of the patient in both ŚS 4.12 and Pindar Pythian  3.38

ŚS 4.12.6 

sá út tiṣṭha préhi prá drava ráthaḥ sucakráḥ



supavíḥ sunā́bhiḥ **práti tiṣṭhordhváḥ**

‘You there stand up, advance, run along. \[Your\] chariot \[has\] strong wheels, rims \[and\] hubs. 

**Stand erect firmly**\!’

While the Atharvavedic patient, directly equated to a chariot, stands upright, Asclepius’s patients, who happen to be injured in different ways, are released, once they are made to stand upright through several remedies:

The three types of patients correlating with three types of remedies in the Pindaric passage parallel the properties and the medical treatments documented in other 

Indo-European languages, such as Vedic \(Benveniste 1945\), Avestan \(Darmesteter 

1877, Puhvel 197039\), Germanic \(Dumézil 1958: 21–22\) and Old Irish \(Watkins 1995: 537–539\), as summarized in the following table:40

According to Benveniste, Dumézil, and Puhvel, the threefold description of ailments and treatments match the tripartite social structure proposed and exhaustively 

**39** Puhvel \(1970\) adds Yašt 3.66 as a further comparandum to the Greek and Vedic evidence. 

**40** In Irish \(see Watkins 1995: 539\) Cath Maige Tuired §§33–35: Míach restores Nuadu’s hand by incantation \(§33\), then he is killed by four cuts  of his father’s sword \(§34\), and finally, from Míach’s grave grow 365 herbs corresponding to the number of his joints and sinews \(§35\). 

**114** 

Laura Massetti

described by Dumézil \(1941\): the patients affected by natural sores and cured with spells could represent the priestly class, those wounded by weapons the warrior 

class, and those affected by exhaustion the ‘third estate’. 

In Greek, just like in the Vedic context, \[to \(make\) stand upright\] describes 

the result, and, so to say, the culminating act of the healing process. Being restored of the capacity of ‘going’ \(cf. Greek ἔξαγεν, Vedic caráthāya, see above\), the patient stands up on his/her own legs. It shall thus be emphasized that Vedic ūrdhvá-, Greek ὀρθός and Avestan ǝrǝduua-, rδβa-  could descend from IE ✶ Hr̥dh-u̯ó- with initial 

✶ h3-, as proposed by Vegas Sansalvador \(1996: 282–288\),41 and may thus constitute a perfect match on the morphological level. 

Finally, a further trait shared by Pindar’s Pythian  3 and Atharvaveda Śaunaka 4.12 must be stressed. The reference to the ‘stone smiting from afar’ in Pindar as a possible cause of injury for the patients with the broken limbs \(μέλη τετρωμένοι** **

**/ **ἢ χερμάδι τηλεβόλῳ, vv. 48–49\) parallels closely the accident of the Atharvavedic wounded patient in ŚS 4.12:

ŚS 4.12.7 

yádi kartáṃ patitvā́ saṃśaśré yádi **vā́śmā** práhr̥to** jaghā́na**

r̥bhū́ ráthasyevā́ṅgāni sáṃ dadhat páruṣā páruḥ

‘If falling in a hole, \[he\] has been injured, **or if** **a** hurled **rock has struck** \[**him**, then\] may 

\[Dhātr̥\] unite the limbs, joint with joint, as R̥bhu \[the parts\] of a chariot.’42

The comparison between Greek ἢ χερμάδι τηλεβόλῳ and Vedic  vā́śmā . . . jaghā́na can go beyond the formal differences, especially on the strength of the combina-tory evidence. As argued by Kölligan \(2000–2001: 443–448\), τηλεβόλος may be 

taken as a continuation of the phraseology \[to smite – from afar\],43 which might 

ultimately underlie the Mycenaean male personal name Qe-re-qo-ta / Ku̯ēlegu̯hontas/ 

\(PY En 659\), Alphabetic Greek Τηλεφόντας✶, Kurzform  Τήλεφος \(Hesiod\+\). Indeed, in Homer βάλλω and θείνω indicate that the enemy is struck by the projectile of 

archer gods, namely, Apollo and Artemis:

**41** See also Sommer \(2022\). 

**42** PS 4.15.6 mentions a different possible cause of injury, namely: the fall of the patient from a tree \(see above\). In this connection I would like to highlight what might be a trivial, but impressive coincidence with the healing practice performed by the bonesetters in the siddha tradition. According to Zysk \(2008: 10\): “the development of this special form of healing \(scil. the art of varmam\) appears to have evolved naturally from the fact that the men of this caste, while carrying out their task of climbing coconut and borassus trees to collect the fruits and sap for toddy, occasionally fell from great heights. In order to repair the injury or save the life of a fall-victim, skills of bone-setting and reviving an unconscious patient by massage developed \[. . .\]”.

Iliad 24.605 

τοὺς μὲν Ἀπόλλων πέφνεν ἀπ᾽ ἀργυρέοιο βιοῖο

‘Apollo slew them with shafts from his silver bow.’

Odyssey 15.478 

τὴν μὲν ἔπειτα γυναῖκα βάλ᾽ Ἄρτεμις ἰοχέαιρα

‘Then Artemis, the archer, struck the woman.’

The personal name Qe-re-qo-ta / Ku̯ēlegu̯hontas/ and τηλεβόλος partially match the Vedic collocation \[to smite – from afar\], in which ‘to smite’ is expressed by the Proto-Indo-European root✶ gu̯hen- ‘smite, kill’, cf. RV 2.27.13cd nákiṣ ṭáṃ ghnantiy ántito ná dūrā́d, yá ādityā́nām bhávati práṇītau ‘neither from near nor from afar do any strike down the man who comes to be under the leadership of the Ādityas.’ Given 

that τηλεβόλος is comparable to Vedic ghnánti . . . dūrā́t, the match between χερμάδι 

τηλεβόλῳ and Vedic áśmā . . . jaghā́na ‘a rock . . . has struck’ looks remarkable and counts as a further feature that Pindar’s description of Asclepius’s healing practice and ŚS 4.12 have in common. 

6. To sum up: In this paper, I have tried to frame PS 4.15.6–7 \(cf. ŚS 4.12.6–7\) in its Vedic poetic context. Additionally I made an attempt at identifying a possible parallel for the ‘healer’: ‘carpenter’ metaphor in the Greek tradition. The results of the comparison are presented in the following table:

**a. ** The cross-reference to the Vedic phraseology applying to the R̥bhu, to whom the Vedic healer is compared, allows us to recover an association between 

Vedic takṣ and the R̥bhus’ work. As a consequence, although the term tákṣan- 

‘carpenter, fashioner’ does not occur in PS 4.15.6–7, the reference to the verb is automatically implied by the mention of the R̥bhu, the god who fashions ‘fresh 

vigor’ and objects in the Rigveda. 

**116** 

Laura Massetti

**b. ** The metaphor ‘healer’: ‘carpenter’ can be understood as complementary to the metaphor ‘body’: ‘chariot’, which underlies both PS 4.15.7 \(cf. ŚS 4.12.7\) and 

several lexical items, denoting the chariot’s components. 

**c. ** An isolated Pindaric expression, τέκτων νωδυνίας✶, a substitution kenning  for 

‘healer’ in Pythian 3.6, possibly shares the same background as PS 4.15.6–7 \(cf. 

ŚS 4.12.6–7\). 

**d. ** Pindar’s ode displays further phraseological traits in common with ŚS 4.12.6–

7. The successful healing process is identified with the capacity of ‘standing 

upright’, \(re-\)acquired by the patient, cf. τούς . . . ἔστασεν ὀρθούς \(v. 53\) with práti tiṣṭhordhváḥ \(ŚS 4.12.6\). 

**e. ** The patients of Asclepius and those of the Vedic healer suffer similar injuries. 

One possible cause of the fracture is described in the same terms in both Greek 

and Vedic, i.e., ‘smiting stone’, cf. ἢ χερμάδι τηλεβόλῳ \(v. 49\) with vā́śmā . . . 

jaghā́na. 

In conclusion, the phraseological matches identified for PS 4.12.6–7, ŚS 4.12.6–7 

and Pindar Pythian 3 are notable for both their quantity – three matches \(c\), \(d\), \(e\), occurring all together in passages dealing with the same themes – and quality – two partial matches \(c\), \(e\), and one perfect match \(d\). Comparanda of this kind speak strongly in favor of a common background, or ‘state of things’, reflected by two
