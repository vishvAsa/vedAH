title = "The ETÁD– YÁD Construction in Vedic"

+++

**Abstract:** In this study of relative clauses in old Vedic, Werner Knobl† compares the *ETÁD–YÁD* construction \(he explains his orthography in footnote 5\), which first occurs in the *R̥gveda-Saṁhitā*, with the *ETÁD–yád* construction, which is first attested in prose passages of the Atharvaveda. It is argued that in the former case, the *YÁD * clause almost always has a non-restrictive, appositive function, with the *there*–deictic demonstrative pronoun *ETÁD* functioning more or less independently. 

In these cases the relative pronoun *YÁD* is flexible changing its gender and number in grammatical agreement with *ETÁD*. By contrast, in the *ETÁd–yád* construction, *yád* restricts and defines *ETÁD* and has itself lost its variability, it has become fixed \(thus “*yád figé*”\). 

The predominantly *there-* deictic demonstrative \(> d-\)pronoun *ETÁD * is the one that realizes the greatest number of possible references.1 It may point at something 

*inside* the text: either in a backward / leftward direction \(= *anaphoric *\[“upward”\] 

deixis\) or in a forward / rightward direction \(= *cataphoric* \[“downward”\] deixis\). 

And it may point at something *outside* the text:2 in a perpendicular or in a side-1 Cf. Knobl 2018, 108: “Keines der mehreren D-Pronomina erschöpft sich in einer einzigen Funktion, aber keines umfasst so viele verschiedene Funktionen wie gerade *ETÁD*.” 

**2** This is the deixis proper or deixis in the narrow sense of the word. 

**Note:** I am very grateful to the members of the Paippalāda Project at the University of Zurich—Angelika Malinar, Paul Widmer, Thomas Zehnder, Robert Leach, and Oliver Hellwig—for having invited me to present a paper at the Atharvaveda conference in Zurich, 2019, September 26–28, and to contribute an article to the proceedings of the conference. 

With affection and gratitude, I dedicate this contribution to my dear old friends Alexander Lubotsky and Arlo Griffiths, without whom I would not have had the immense pleasure to study the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā for so many years of my scholarly life. 

I also pay compliments of admiration to my fellow-students of Vedic—Kyōko Amano, Kristen de Joseph, Duccio Lelli, Marianne Oort, Umberto Selva, and Carmen Sylvia Spiers—for their learned devotion to the commented editions or translations of difficult texts. 

I thank especially Carmen for helpful comments on an earlier draft of the present paper. The provisionally final version, submitted in April 2021, was critically reviewed by the editors of the proceedings, Oliver Hellwig \(May 23, 2021, and March 31, 2022\), Robert Leach \(June 07/08/11/14, 2021\), and Thomas Zehnder \(June 26/27, 2021\); I feel very obliged to them for their corrections and suggestions, which led to many changes and, hopefully, improvements.

ward- *slanting* direction.3 The obliquity is again of two kinds: it may be inclined either to the left, leaning backward, or to the right, leaning forward. 

Fan-like, the several functions of *ETÁD* spread out in a semicircle, radiating from a central point, which is their common * there-* deixis. This exceptionally multifunctional d-pronoun typically refers – either *intra-* or *extra-* textually – to something that is located at a *middle* distance, somewhere *between* ‘nearby’ and ‘ faraway’.4 

As a rule, neither the *near-* deictic *IDÁM* ‘the one *here*’ nor the *far-* deictic *ADÁS* ‘the one *over there*’ could accomplish the characteristic *there-* deictic function of *ETÁD*.5

The eight sections of this paper are centered around the *ETÁD–yád* construction, a syntactical scheme that is first attested in a few rare prose passages of the Atharvaveda \(AV\): Śaunaka-Saṁhitā \(ŚS\)6 and Paippalāda-Saṁhitā \(PS\).7 However, in order to bring out the specific character of the *ETÁD–yád* construction, we have to contrast it with the *ETÁD–YÁD * construction that occurs in the earliest Vedic text corpus, the R̥gveda \(R̥V\).8 

There, the relative pronoun is not typically *figé* \(“*yád*”\),9 as in those later AV prose passages, but flexible \(“*YÁD*”\), changing its gender and number in grammatical agree-3 Cf. Knobl 2018, 107: “Hingegen ist die Richtung, in welche die im engeren Sinne deiktischen Pronomina zeigen, eine transversale/rektanguläre oder auch – wie in anderem Zusammenhang noch eigens auszuführen sein wird – diagonale.” 

For the reason why certain d-pronouns may be said to point in a transversal or rectangular direction, see Knobl 2018, 107 n.2: “Insofern sie nämlich quer und sozusagen im rechten Winkel zum horizontalen Verlauf des Texts auf Außersprachliches hinausweisen.” 

**4** Cf. Knobl 2018, 108: “*ETÁD* ist das D-Pronomen der *mittleren* Distanz *par excellence*. Es vermag, sowohl in eine *relative Nähe* als auch in eine *relative Ferne* zu weisen.” 

**5** When referring to d-pronouns \( *sá-*/ *tá-*, *eṣá-*/ *etá-*, etc.\), the neuter singular of their names, if written in capital letters \( *TÁD*, *ETÁD*, etc.\), is used as a *cover symbol* comprising every possible form of the respective paradigm. In the very special case of the relative pronoun *yá-*, this capitalizing device conveniently serves the purpose of distinguishing *YÁD*, potentially representing all paradigmatic case-forms, from *yád*, which stands for just one. And that distinction is most important for my argument. 

**6** Six passages of the ŚS are treated in section G.: five prose sentences \(\[1\] ŚS 9.5.21, \[2\] ŚS 9.5.31b, 

\[3\] ŚS 9.6.23, \[4\] ŚS 9.6.37, and \[5\] ŚS 11.3.50\) and one metrical text, the distich \[6\] ŚS 18.1.14cd. 

**7** In sections D. and E., the two middlemost parts of this paper, three passages of the PS are highlighted: the metrical line at \[19\] PS 6.9.1d, which displays the presumably oldest “*yád figé*” \(D.\), and two of the twelve prose sentences at \[20\] PS 9.21.1–12, all of which exemplify the central *ETÁD–yád* construction in strictly parallel formulations: *ETAD vai . . . yad . . . * \(E.\). 

**8** Thirteen R̥V and AV passages \(examples \[1\] *–*\[13\]\), all but one of which exhibit the *ETÁD–YÁD * construction, are translated and discussed in section A., two examples of the *YÁD–ETÁD* construction \(exx. 

\[14\] R̥V 10.71.9 and \[15\] R̥V 10.165.4\) in section B., and three examples showing the *split* or *double* reference of *ETÁD* \(exx. \[16\] R̥V 10.10.3ab, \[17\] R̥V 10.10.11cd, and \[18\] R̥V 10.10.12\) are presented in section C. 

Among these eighteen text-passages of the R̥V, no fewer than eight have parallels in the AV \(ŚS 

or PS\); they are examples \[9\]–\[12\] and \[15\]–\[18\].

ment with *ETÁD*.10 Only in one of the thirteen examples, i.e. at \[7\] R̥V 7.56.4ab *etā́ni . . . *

*yád . . . *, do the two pronouns, though of the same gender, not agree in number.11

**1  The *ETÁD–YÁD***** Construction in the R̥gveda**

The *ETÁD*– *YÁD* construction is extremely rare in the R̥gveda.12 Only some twenty examples can be found. In almost all of these, the subordinate *YÁD*–clause seems to have a non-restrictive, appositive function.13 If *ETÁD* were a mere correlative, it would need the relative pronoun *YÁD* as a necessary supplement, so that its exact reference could be understood. But there is no such need or necessity in most of the twenty or so *ETÁD*– *YÁD * constructions of the R̥V. In a majority of cases, the *deictic* character of *ETÁD* is so strong that it works quite well without the *YÁD*–phrase. 

Independently, the *there-* deictic pronoun *points at* some either intra- or extra-textual entity.14 That d-pronoun displays a surplus of *demonstrativity* by virtue of which it transcends any purely correlative function. 

Twelve of the following thirteen passages – eight distichs and four stanzas – 

present the *ETÁD*– *YÁD * construction that is typical for the R̥gveda.15 In most examples of this syntactical scheme, the *YÁD*–phrase contains a verb:16 \[1\] *yát* te *cakr̥mā́ *

\(b\), \[2\] *yéna . . . nirūháthuḥ* \(c\), \[3\] *yát te ghóṣān* \(b\), \[4\] *yáṃ . . . vicakrá* \(b\), \[5\] 

*yásya\_ī́śiṣe* \(d\), \[6\] *yé . . . átakṣan *\(b\), * yé . . . tiránta *\(c\), * yé . . . dī́dhayan* \(d\), \[7\] *yád . . . *

**10** The twelve *ETÁD–YÁD * constructions of R̥V and AV treated in section A. involve their syntactical reverse, the *YÁD–ETÁD* construction, two instances of which are discussed under \[14\] and \[15\] in section B. 

**11** For a possible solution to the difficult problem of their incongruence, see the comment on example \[7\] below. 

**12** This first section of the present article is a considerably enlarged and elaborated version of the opening part of the paper I read at the September 2019 Atharvaveda conference in Zurich. 

**13** By contrast, in *TÁD*– *YÁD* or *YÁD*– *TÁD* constructions, which are far more frequent than the *ETÁD*– *YÁD* construction, it is usual for the *YÁD*–clause to function restrictively. The demonstrative force of *TÁD* is not as strong and independent as that of the emphatic *there-* deictic *ETÁD*; due to its lack of emphasis, *TÁD* stands in need of the relative pronoun’s support. 

**14** The combination of these divergent directions – if it is understood as the quasi-mechanical *resultant* of two concurrent forces – constitutes what I fancy calling *diagonal reference*. It is the most interesting, but also most challenging and difficult-to-describe function the *multi-* functional d-pronoun *ETÁD* may have to offer. 

**15** Only one passage is an exception, to wit, \[10\] R̥V 10.10.1ab \(≈ ŚS 18.1.1ab\), a distich without either *ETÁD* or *YÁD*; it is, however, an indispensable explanatory addition to the distich \[9\] R̥V 

10.10.2ab \(≈ ŚS 18.1.2ab\), where those two pronouns do occur in a characteristic *ETÁD–YÁD * construction. 

**16** Or three verbs in example \[6\] R̥V 7.7.6b–d *yé . . . átakṣan*, * yé . . . tiránta*, * yé . . . dī́dhayan*.

*jabhā́ra* \(b\), \[8\] *yáḥ . . . praminā́ti* \(d\), \[9\] *yád . . . bhávāti* \(b\), \[11\] *yé cáranti* \(b\), \[13\] 

*yā́ni dadhiṣé* \(b\). Exceptionally, the relative pronoun is construed with a noun in examples \[5\] *yás te* *ánnam* \(d\) and \[12\] *yáś ca camasó* \(c\).17

\[1\] R̥V 1.31.18ab

*eténāgne bráhmaṇā vāvr̥dhasva*

*śáktī vā yát te cakr̥mā́ vidā́ vā */

The sentence of the first verse is complete and can be understood on its own: 

*eténāgne bráhmaṇā vāvr̥dhasva *‘Grow\! You *shall * grow strong \[and stronger\],18 o Fire, through *that* poem *there* \(, which we have made *for you*\).’

The subordinate *yád-* clause of the second line, 18b *śáktī vā yát te cakr̥mā́ vidā́ *

*vā *‘ *which* \[poem\] we have made *for you* with skill or with knowledge,’19 does not *restrict* the meaning of ‘ *that * poem *there*’ to one that would be *defined* as being made in a certain way. Rather, the *there-* deictic pronoun *eténa* in 18a refers, by way of final conclusion, to the preceding stanzas \(1–17\), which are *distinctly* there as the first part of a bipartite whole.20

**17** In the first of these exceptional cases, i.e. at \[5\] R̥V 6.41.3d . . . *yás te ánnam *‘which \[so-ma-drink\] is your food’, the relative pronoun is not attracted in gender to the nominal predicate, apparently under the predominant influence of the masculine *there-* deictic demonstratives *eṣá* \(a\) and *etám *\(c\) – both referring to the soma-drink – in the two preceding main sentences \(3ab and 3c\). 

For the subscript** ** *ca*** **in example \[12\]** ** *yáś ca camasó*, see below, footnote 73. 

**18** The hybrid verb form *vāvr̥dh-a-sva*, which is based on the weak stem of the perfect \( *vāvr̥dh-* R̥V 

122x\) of the root *vardh*/ *vr̥dh* ‘to grow strong’ < PIE ✶ *Hu̯eRdh* ‘groß/stark werden’ \( *LIV* 228\), was defined by Lubotsky \(1997: 2.1351b\) as an imperative to the subjunctive stem *vāvr̥dh-a-* \(R̥V 2x: 1.33.1b *vāvr̥dhāti* \[in the cadence of a *triṣṭubh*, with metrically conditioned “hyper-characterization”\] ‘shall make increase’ and 10.64.4b \[in the break of a *jagatī*, under no prosodic constraint\] 

*vāvr̥dhate* ‘will grow strong’\). 

For the discussion of a similar modal blend, in which the same two moods of the perfect \(subjunctive and imperative\) are crossbred – namely the nonce formation *pipráy-a-sva*** **occurring at R̥V 8.11.10c *suvā́ṃ cāgne* *tanúvam pipráyasva*** **‘Please\! You *shall*** **please, o Agni, your own bodily self** **

\( *tanū́-*** **f. \[R̥V 208x\]\)’–, see Knobl 2004: 267–270 = Knobl 2009c: 27–30. 

**19** In R̥V and AV, both *śákti-* f. ‘skill’ \(R̥V 4x, ŚS 3x \[~ *śaktí-* f. R̥V 10x\]\) and *víd-* f. ‘knowledge’ \(R̥V 

1x\) are surprisingly rare. Root-compounds with *-víd-* as second member \(from *aśva-víd-* \[R̥V 2x\] 

through *hotrā-víd-* \[R̥V 2x, ŚS 1x\]\) are, however, very frequently attested. The total number of occurrences in the R̥V amounts to 136 instances – including a few *-vít-tara- * comparatives and *-vít-ta-ma- * superlatives – in 28 different compounds; among them, *suvar-víd-* \(R̥V 30x, ŚS 11\+✶1x\) is most frequent. Cf. Scarlata 1999: 480–493. 

**20** Since the last stanza of this hymn \(18\), a regular *triṣṭubh*, even though it may not be a later addition, is at least slightly *set off against* the rest of the hymn \(1 *–* 17\) – which is predominantly composed in the *jagatī* meter \(only stanzas 8 and 16 are also hendecasyllabic\) –, the *there-* deictic *ETÁD* in 18a \( *eténa* . . . *bráhmaṇā* ‘through *that* poem *there* \[for you\]’\) fittingly reflects the contex-

The *ETÁD–YÁD* Construction in Vedic 

[[13]]

The *bráhmaṇ-* n. ‘poem’ \(R̥V 255x ~ *brahmáṇ-* m. ‘poet’ R̥V 51x\) happens to be ‘made with skill or with knowledge’, but the fact of being made skillfully and knowledgeably is as accidental to the *existence* of the poem’s first part as is the fact that through it the fire shall grow strong. The existential deixis of *ETÁD* indicating something that *is there* – at some distance, although within the same poetic context – surpasses any specific qualification the *YÁD-* phrase may provide. 

Agni is addressed throughout this hymn of eighteen stanzas. The enclitic voc-

ative *agne* ‘o Fire’ occurs in the first verse of every single stanza – thus creating the song’s thematic unity –,21 while *eténa* in the first verse of the last stanza \(18a\), being the only occurrence of *ETÁD* in this hymn, introduces a certain differentiat-ing distance. According to the general function of the *there-* deictic pronoun, it may be expected to point at something that is farther away – here, at something halfway removed from the poet reciting stanza 18 – than that which the *here-* deictic *IDÁM* 

in 16ab refers to: *imā́m* *agne śaráṇim mīmr̥ṣo na imám ádhvānaṃ yám ágāma dūrā́t* 

‘O Agni, make *this* our breach \(of faith\) be forgotten \[and forgiven by you\], *this* \(faithless\) way \[on\] which we have come from faraway.’22

It is mainly the implicit *you-* deixis of the *there-* deictic pronoun *ETÁD* 23 that accounts for it being preferred over the *here-* deictic *IDÁM* and *this * d-pronoun’s proximal *we-* deixis: ‘ *this * breach’ \( *imā́m* . . . *śaráṇim*\) and ‘ *this* way’ \( *imám ádh-vānam*\) are both *ours* \( *nas* \[16a\]\), whereas ‘ *that* poem *there*’ \( *eténa* . . . *bráhmaṇā* 

tual *mid-distance* that unequally divides a divisible unity into two, separating one part of the poem \(18\) from another \(1 *–* 17\). 

See the symbolic extra space between stanzas 17 and 18 in the edition of Geldner’s translation \(1951: 1.36\), and cf. J&B’s quite appropriate introductory remark \(2014: 1.132\): “As often, the final verse \(18\) is** ** *somewhat extra-hymnic*, in that it sums up the hymn that precedes . . .” \( *my*** **italics\). ** **

**21** Typically, the enclitic vocative * agne* stands – alone or after another enclitic, the pronoun *nas* – in the so-called Wackernagel position of every first verse: *tuvám agne* . . . in 1a–6a, 10a, 13a–15a \(= 10x\); *tuváṃ no agne . . . * in 8a, 9a, 12a \(= 3x\); *tuváṃ tám agne . . . * in 7a \(= 1x\); *tvā́m agne* . . . in 11a \(= 1x\); *imā́m agne* . . . in 16a \(= 1x\); *manuṣvád agne* . . . in 17a \(= 1x\); *eténāgne* . . . in 18a \(= 1x\). 

*Two*** **orthotone pronouns \( *tuváṃ tám*\) preceding** ** *agne*** **before the cæsura in 7a produce an exceptional sequence of words. If the meter had allowed for it, the enclitic** ** *enam*** **\(R̥V 76x\) could have been expected to occur in place of** ** *tám*** **\[7b** ** *mártam*\]. To be sure, a monosyllabic scansion of the** **personal pronoun would make the opening of 7a metrically acceptable; that is, if it were read as** ** *tvám enam agne*. 

**22** Cf. Geldner \(1951: 1.36\): “Verzeih uns, Agni, diesen Ungehorsam, den Weg, den wir von Ferne gekommen sind\!” Notice the accusative of spatial extent, \( *imám ádhvānaṃ*\) * yám* ‘\(this way\) which’, being governed directly by a verb of motion, *ágāma* ‘we have come’, without any intervening preposition. 

**23** For the occasional *du-* deixis of the *da-* deictic d-pronoun *ETÁD*, see the seven examples in Knobl 2018: 110–112 \[exx. \(2\) and \(4\)\], 114–115 \[ex. \(8\)\], 117 \[ex. \(11\)\], 119–121 \[exx. \(15\)–\(17\)\].

*yuvám etáṃ cakrathuḥ síndhuṣu plavám*

*yéna devatrā́ mánasā nirūháthuḥ*

‘You two \[Aśvins\] have made for Tugra’s son \(Bhujyu\)

*that* raft *there* in the rivers, \[a raft\] winged and animated,26

**24** Cf. again Knobl 2018, where 13 contexts are discussed in which *ETÁD* ‘the one *there*’ clearly contrasts with *IDÁM* ‘the one *here*’; see exx. \(1\)–\(9\) and exx. \(11\)–\(14\). If *ETÁD* meant ‘this’, it could not be distinguished from *IDÁM* ‘this’. And non-distinction of these d-pronouns, in spite of their de-monstrably distinct deixis, would prevent us from understanding the precise meaning especially of those text-passages in which they occur side by side, in the same distich or stanza; or else, nearby, as in the Agni-hymn \[1\] R̥V 1.31, where *eténa* \[18a\] stands in obvious opposition to *imā́m* \[16a\] and *imám *\[16b\]. 

Whenever there is no close textual contact between** ** *ETÁD*** **and** ** *IDÁM*, translators run a higher risk of mis-interpreting the** ** *there-* deictic pronoun as** ** *here*-deictic, than if the two demonstratives were contiguous. Their contiguity would be apt to suggest a significant difference in demonstra-tion; and it should then become clear that one of the two d-pronouns points at something** ** *near by*, the other at something** ** *farther away***. **

**25** Thus, the enclitic pronoun *te* could be thought to have two different case functions: \[1\] as dative, it would express destination – or, on the stage of a higher level, play the role of the second *kāraka* 

\[act-participant\], called *saṃpradāna* and redefined by Pāṇini at Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.4.32 *karmaṇā yam* *abhi praiti* *sa saṃpradānam* \[for the syntax of this aphorism, see below, section D.: Excursus \(2\)\] –; 

\[2\] as genitive, *te* would imply belonging or connection \( *saṃbandha*\). 

**26** Is it possible that *ātmán-* m. ‘breath, soul, self’ \(R̥V 22x\) in *ātmanvánt-* \(R̥V 3x\) refers to the 

‘body’ of the raft; and *pakṣá-* m. ‘wing’ \(R̥V 10x\) in *pakṣín-* ‘winged; bird’ \(R̥V 6x\), to ‘sails’? Cf. J&B 

2014: 1.385: “For Tugra’s son \(Bhujyu\) in the rivers you made the boat, with a body \[=cockpit?\] and wings \[=sails?\], . . .”. In other Saṁhitās \(ŚS, VS, MS, KS\), in Brāhmaṇas \(e.g. ŚB\), and in younger Vedic texts, *ātmán-* m. is well attested in the sense of ‘body’ – and especially in that of ‘trunk, torso’ 

as distinct from *áṅga-* ‘limb’ or *pakṣa-puchá-* ‘wings-and-tail’ –, but can the meaning ‘body’ be presupposed already for the R̥V? Yes, at least in a late, Atharvaveda-like *yakṣma-nā́śana-* hymn, at R̥V 

10.163.5cd=6cd *yákṣmaṁ sárvasmād ātmánas tám idáṃ ví vr̥hāmi te* “vom ganzen Körper zieh ich dir jetzt die Auszehrung ab” \(Geldner 1951: 3.390\), *ātmán-* m. does have that very meaning. 

The *ETÁD–YÁD* Construction in Vedic 

[[15]]

*by means of which* you have extracted \[him\] with heavenly-bound intention.27

Swiftly flying28 you have flown \[with him\]29 from the huge surge.’

Neither the *far-* deictic “*jenes* . . . Boot” \(Geldner\) nor the *near-* deictic “*dieses* Floß” 

\(W&G\) does justice to the characteristic *there-* deixis of *ETÁD* in *etáṃ . . . plavám *

‘ *that* raft *there* \(in the rivers\)’. Typically, this d-pronoun locates the *plavá-* m. \(R̥V 

1x, ŚS 1x\) at a *middle* distance, somewhere between *here* on the one hand, and *over* **27** See Geldner’s note on 5c: “*devatrā́ mánasā* ungefähr *devadrī́cā mánasā*” and his translation of the phrase: “mit götterhaftem Sinne” \(1951: 1.262\). Truer to the meaning of the adverb *devatrā́ *\(R̥V 

23x, ŚS 2\+✶3x\), if taken as a near-synonym of the directional adjective *devadryáñc-*/ *devadrī́c-* \(R̥V 

3x\), is J&B’s “with \(your?\) mind directed toward the gods” \(2014: 1.385\). 

The phrase** ** *devadrī́cā mánasā*** **occurs twice in the R̥V, once at 1.93.8b “mit gottgerichtetem Denken” \(Geldner 1951: 1.120\) and another time at 1.163.12b “mit gottwärts gerichtetem Gedanken” 

\(Geldner 1951: 1.227\). 

**28** It would be closer to the sense of this unique compound *su-paptaní-* \(R̥V 1x\) – a *bahuvrīhi* \(?\) in which *su-* functions as an adverb \(\!\) –, if the instrumental *supaptanī́ * were translated ‘with *swiftly* \(flying\) flight’. The second member, ✶ *paptani-* ‘flight’ \(or ‘flying’?\), is either based on the stem of the third/reduplicated \(non-causative\) aorist *pa-pt-a-t* \(R̥V 10x ~ *pī-pat-a-t* R̥V 1x\), or on the weak stem of the older perfect *pa-pt-* \(R̥V 5x ~ *pet-* R̥V 3x\) of the root *pati*/ *pti* ‘fall, fly’ < PIE ✶ *peth1* ‘fallen’ 

\( *LIV* 477–478\) / ✶ *peth2* ‘\(auf\)fliegen’ \( *LIV* 479\). Cf. W&D 2.1: 178 § 75 h: *su-papt-aní-* “guter Flug”, but W&D 2.2: 208 § 96 d: *su-paptaní-* “rascher Flug” or “rasch fliegend”, and Oldenberg 1909: 181 ad loc.: 

“✶ *paptani* kann Nomen agentis oder actionis sein.”

*petathuḥ*** – **represents a relatively rare kind. For the more frequent type, the construction of a verb with a cognate *su-* compound in the accusative, such as *súbhr̥tam bhárati*** **at R̥V 4.50.7c or** ** *bharat* *súbhr̥tam * at R̥V 9.97.24d, see the scholarly literature referred to by Hoffmann 1992: 834 footnote 11. 

**29** Or else, if a possibly preferable understanding of the verb-form were to be considered, *petathuḥ* 

could mean ‘you two have *made* \[him\] *fly*’. Since, in the R̥V, the periphrastic perfect expressing causation is not yet attested, and may not even have existed at that time, non-periphrastic forms of the perfect – as here *petathuḥ* – could also function as causatives. See below, footnote 60, on the causal meaning of the perfect optative *vavr̥tyām *‘I would have liked to *make *\[the companion\] 

*revert* \[to acts of companionship\]’ at R̥V 10.10.1a, in example \[10\]. 

The first and oldest occurrence of the periphrastic perfect in Vedic is** ** *gamayā́ṃ cakāra*** **at ŚS 18.2.27cd \(≈ PS 18.65.10cd\):** ** *mr̥tyúr yamásyāsīd dūtáḥ prácetā ásūn pitŕ̥bhyo gamayā́ṃ cakāra*** **

“death was the kindly messenger of Yama; he made his life-breaths \( *ásu*\) go to the fathers” \(W&L\). 

Thus, if** ** *petathuḥ*** **had the meaning of a causative, it could be glossed with** ** *pātayā́ṃ cakrathuḥ*, according to later, post-r̥gvedic usage.

*there* on the other. Were the raft *nearby*, it would be pointed at with *imám*; were it *faraway*, with *amúm*. 

The deixis of the article in the expression “*the * boat” \(J&B\) is too weak to transcend the function of a mere correlative of the relative pronoun *yéna* “with which” 

\(J&B\). In the R̥gveda, the *there-* deictic d-pronoun *ETÁD* is, if at all, very rarely used in an exclusively correlative function. 

As in example \[1\], so it seems also here that the subordinate *YÁD-* phrase \( *yéna* 

\[ *plavéna*\]\) does not restrict or define the meaning of *ETÁD* in the main sentence \( *etám* . . . *plavám*\): ‘ *that * raft *there*’ * – * it * is there*, ‘in the rivers’ \( *síndhuṣu*\), of unmis-takable identity; and the relative clause *yéna* . . . *nirūháthuḥ* ‘ *by means of which* you have extracted \[him\]’ proves as accidentally descriptive as the fact that the Aśvins happen to have made it for Tugra’s son \( *taugriyā́ya*\) or that it is ‘winged’ \( *pakṣíṇ-*\) and ‘animated’ \( *ātmanvánt-*\).30

\[3\] R̥V 3.33.8ab

*etád váco jaritar mā́pi mr̥ṣṭhā*

*ā́ yát te ghóṣān úttarā yugā́ni */

‘Do not forget *that * word *there*, o singer \[Viśvāmitra\], 

*which* \[word\] of yours later generations shall listen to.’

Also in this distich, the meaning of *etád vácas *‘ *that* word \(of yours\) *there*’ does not depend on the following *yád-* phrase, *ā́ yát te ghóṣān úttarā yugā́ni *‘ *which* \[word\] of yours later generations shall listen to.’ If it did depend on *yád*, the request addressed by the rivers Vipāś and Śutudrī to the *r̥ṣi* Viśvāmitra, viz. *etád váco* *jaritar* *mā́pi* *mr̥ṣṭhāḥ *‘Do not forget *that * word \(of yours\) *there*, o singer’, would be restricted to *one* kind of word, namely to the word that later generations will listen to \( *ā́ . . . *

*ghóṣān*\); and any *other * kind of word, one that is *not* listened to in the future, the poet may as well forget? Surely, that cannot be the meaning.31

**30** In Hettrich’s view \(1988: 570\), the *ETÁD* of this stanza functions as correlative in a *restrictive* relative construction. It will appear in that function only if the demonstrative force of *ETÁD* is not understood as emphatically *there-* deictic. 

**31** It is interesting to see that *here*, in *this* distich \(\[3\] R̥V 3.33.8ab\), exactly as *there*, in *that* distich \(\[1\] R̥V 1.31.18ab\), the enclitic pronoun *te* appears in the subordinate clause; it would be somewhat superfluous if it showed up in the main sentence. The *there-* deictic *ETÁD*, which is addressed to a second person – *there*, in \[1\], to Agni; *here*, in \[3\], to the singer –, is so distinctly *you-* deictic that *te* ‘of yours’, if it were added either to \[1\] *eténa bráhmaṇā* or to \[3\] *etád vácas*, would prove pleo-nastic. \(Naturally, this does not mean that redundancy and over-characterization are always and necessarily excluded.\)

The *ETÁD–YÁD* Construction in Vedic 

[[17]]

Since the neuter *yád* can also be taken as a conjunction of purpose, Renou’s “en sorte que” and J&B’s “so that” are certainly justified.32 In this alternative case, the future hearing of the poet’s word would seem to depend on its not being forgotten by the poet, a situation very different from the one we have been discussing. 

\[4\] R̥V 4.35.4ab

*kimmáyaḥ svic camasá eṣá āsa*

*yáṃ kā́viyena catúro vicakrá */

‘What was *that* cup \(of yours\) *there* made of? 

\[ *That * cup,\] *which* you have transformed into four

by means of \[your\] poetic power.’33

When they were addressed in these words, the heavenly craftsmen knew exactly 

what cup was meant, to wit, that unique *miracle* cup of theirs; and there was no need for them to be told about its artful transformation \(“trans- *four-* mation”\) into *four * cups – one for each of the three R̥bhus and one for Tvaṣṭar –, so that they would understand the intended reference to it.34

The *YÁD*–phrase, *yáṃ *\[ *camasáṃ*\] * kā́viyena catúro vicakrá*, is only descriptive, not defining or distinguishing.35 The interrogative sentence *kimmáyaḥ svic camasá* *eṣá āsa * does not necessarily presuppose a plurality of cups from which the quad-32 Cf. Renou \( *EVP* XVII 76\): “Cette parole-ci, ô chantre, ne l’oublie pas, *en sorte que* les générations ultérieures puissent l’entendre de toi\!” or J&B \(2014: 1.514\): “This speech, singer – do not forget it – *so that* later generations will hear it from you.” In both of these \(otherwise not inappropriate\) translations, the typical *there-* deixis of the d-pronoun *etád* is inadequately rendered as *here-* deixis: 

“*Cette * parole- *ci*” \(Renou\), “*This* speech” \(J&B\), as if the poet had used *idám* instead. 

**33** Intonation distinguishes the abstract noun *kā́vya-* n. ‘poem, poetry, poetic power’ \(R̥V 41x, ŚS 

\[3\+✶2=\]5x\) from the less frequent \(substantivized\) adjective and patronymic *kāvyá-* \(R̥V 7x, ŚS 2x\). 

Both of these words are ultimately derived from the same *kaví-* m. ‘seer, poet’ \(R̥V 240x\), although with two different *ya-* suffixes. Pāṇini’s *taddhita-* suffix ***ñ**ya**ṅ***, introduced at Aṣṭādhyāyī 4.1.171 *vr̥ddha-it-kosala-ajādāñ ñyaṅ*, would only provide for the formation of *kā́vya-*: either from the *vr̥ddha-* stem *kāvyá-* or directly from the *i-* stem *kaví-*. 

**34** Prior to stanza 4, the R̥bhus’ quadruplication of their miracle cup was already mentioned two times: once in verse 2d *ékaṃ vicakrá camasáṃ caturdhā́* and again in verse 3a *víy akr̥ṇota camasáṃ caturdhā́*. It is, therefore, all the more superfluous to repeat the mention of that artistic exploit yet another time, in the relative clause of verse 4b *yáṃ kā́viyena catúro vicakrá*. Here, the only new information is *kā́viyena*, but this particular circumstance does not change the appositional character of the whole phrase; *kā́viyena* was, furthermore, anticipated in verse 2c by two instrumentals of a *near-* synonymous intent: *sukr̥tyáyā* . . . *suvapasyáyā* “mit Geschicklichkeit und Kunstfertigkeit” 

\(Geldner 1951: 1.466\); thus, the information received is not *that* new. 

**35** According to Hettrich \(1988: 570 n.145\), “ist der RS \(=Relativ-Satz\) nicht eindeutig als restriktiv oder appositiv bestimmbar.” In my view, it is possible to determine – und zwar “eindeutig” – that the relative sentence *yám* . . . *catúro vicakrá* ‘\[ *that* cup \(of yours\) *there*,\] * which* you have transformed into four’ has an appositive \(descriptive\) function, and not a restrictive one.

‘ *That* drop *there*, \[ *that*\] all-colored bull,

drink *that* \[soma\], o lord of bay horses, o mighty charioteer,38

\[ *that* soma-drink\] *of which* you are master, 

and *which* is your food, from of old.’39

The statements made in the two subordinate clauses of *pāda* 3d – i.e. *yásya\_ī́śiṣe* and *yás te ánnam* – are so obviously true of each-and-every soma-drink that they could not possibly be thought to define one drink in particular and distinguish it from all the others. 

**36** Here, as in examples \[1\] and \[3\], the *there-* deixis of *ETÁD* is again also *you-* deictic. 

**37** Do *vŕ̥ṣaṇ-* m. referring to Indra as ‘bull’ and *vr̥ṣabhá-* m. qualifying the soma-drop as ‘bull’ have distinctive values? Or are these two nouns mere synonyms, chosen only for the sake of stylistic variation?. 

**38** A metrical line of 11 syllables with just one *udātta* is quite rare. For the discussion of a *pāda* without *any* high-pitch tone, the unparalleled octosyllabic verse R̥V 1.2.8b *r̥tāvr̥dhāv r̥taspr̥śā*, with two vocatives embedded in a *gāyatrī-* stanza \(8a–c\) that is addressed to Mitra-and-Varuṇa, see Lelli forthc. 

**39** The in-between position of *pradívi* \(R̥V 8x\) is ambiguous: syntactically, it ought to belong with the preceding *yásya\_ī́śiṣe*, because the following *yás te* starts a new sentence; but metrically, it should be taken with the latter, because the cæsura occurring before the adverb \(= locative of *pradív-* \[R̥V 30x\]\) cuts it off from the former. 

This is one of those numerous cases where meter and syntax are in conflict. For another such example, see below, the double-faced** ** *Janus-* character of** ** *deváḥ*** **in the verse \[8\] R̥V 7.63.3c** ** *eṣá me* *deváḥ savitā́ cachanda ***‘** *That*** **Heavenly one** ** *there*** **\(= the rising Sun\) appears \[and appeals\] to me as Heavenly Savitar.’

The effect ambiguous words like** ** *pradívi*** **\(in example \[5\]\) and** ** *deváḥ*** **\(in example \[8\]\) may have on the reader or listener can be compared with that of a well-known rhetorical scheme profusely used in Sanskrit literature: the device called either** ** *kākākṣi-golaka-nyāya-or dehalī-dīpaka-nyāya-**. ***
* 
For the evocative meaning of these two “popular maxims” and their technical application in** **commentaries on texts of a mainly philosophical or poetological nature, see Jacob 1907: 18 and 30. 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[19]]

\[6\] R̥V 7.7.6

eté dyumnébhir víśvam ā́tiranta

mántraṃ yé vā́raṃ náriyā átakṣan /

prá yé víśas tiránta śróṣamāṇā

‘ Those \(men\) there, with their heavenly splendors, surpass\(ed\)40 everything: the manly \[singers of praise\] who shaped a choice poetic thought, 

\[or the generous patrons\] who shall further the obedient clans, 

and who shall be mindful of this truth of mine.’

It is very likely that the there- deictic d-pronoun eté of the main sentence in pāda 6a – eté dyumnébhir víśvam ā́ tiranta \( ā́tiranta\) – directly points at the ‘singers of praise’ \( stotár- m. \[R̥V 105x\]\) and at the ‘generous patrons’ \( maghávan-**/** maghávant- 

\[R̥V 370x\]\), both of which groups are explicitly mentioned in the last stanza of this Agni-hymn, viz. in the verse 7.7.7c íṣaṁ stotŕ̥bhyo maghávadbhya ānaḍ \(“You \[o Agni\] have obtained refreshment for the singers of praise and for our generous 

\(patrons\)” \[J&B 2014: 2.892\]\); and they are collectively referred to as ‘men’ \( nár-/ nŕ̥- 

m. R̥V 452x\) in the compound nr̥-ṣádana- n. \(R̥V 6x\) of the distich 7.7.5ab ásādi vr̥tó váhnir ājaganvā́n agnír brahmā́ nr̥ṣádane vidhartā́ “Having come here, the chosen conveyor \(of oblations\) has been seated at the seat of men – Agni, the ritual formu-lator and distributor” \(J&B 2014: 2.892\). 

The three subordinate clauses in verses 7.7.6 b, c, d – all of which contain the same relative pronoun yé 41 – could, therefore, refer to one of the two groups: either **40** The pada-pāṭha reads ā́ / atiranta, but the possibly contracted ā́tiranta  of the original recitation \(and of the devanāgarī- text written in scriptio continua\) could also be interpreted as ā́ tiranta. The imperfect átakṣan in 6b speaks in favor of the former reading, the apparent injunctive tiránta in 6c seems to support the latter. However, according to Hoffmann \(1967: 258 n.296\), tiránta in 6c may have to be considered a subjunctive, because of dī́dhayan in 6d, which represents the subjunctive of a present that has developed from a present perfect. Geldner \(1951: 2.187\) opted for the imperfect atiranta \(“Diese haben an Glanz alles übertroffen”\), J&B \(2014: 2.892\) for tiranta understood as injunctive \(“These surpass everything through their heavenly brilliance”\). 

**41** Interestingly, YÁD often comes in second place of a subordinate clause; and here, in R̥V 7.7.6, yé occupies that very position even three times, in the verses 6b, 6c, 6d: mántraṃ yé . . ., prá yé . . ., ā́ 

yé . . .; the repetition of the relative pronoun may have been intended to emphasize the climactic intensification of meaning: not only is a temporal progress made, from the past \(imperfect átakṣan 

\[6b\]\) to the future \(subjunctive tiránta \[6c\] and subjunctive dī́dhayan \[6d\]\), but also a change of person, from the singers of praise \[6b\] to the generously rewarding patrons \[6c and 6d\]: “die \[Dichter\], welche mannhaft das Dichterwort passend geformt haben \[6b\], \[die Patrone,\] die die gehorsamen Clane vorwärts bringen mögen \[6c\], die dieser meiner rechten \(Rede\) gedenken mögen \[6d\]” \(Geldner 1951: 2.187\); see also J&B’s somewhat different translation of the same three verses in the following two footnotes.

Werner Knobl 

to the singers \(in b\)42 or to the patrons \(in c and d\);43 however, neither of these two references is necessary in order to understand that the there- deictic d-pronoun eté ‘ those’ points at ‘ those men there’, who are seated together ‘at the seat of men’ 

\( nr̥ṣádane\), which seat – or else, session \(“Männersitzung” \[Geldner\]\) – was already mentioned in the previous stanza, at 7.7.5b.44

\[7\] R̥V 7.56.4

etā́ni dhī́ro niṇyā́ ciketa

‘ Those mysteries the deeply thinking man understands,45

which \[mystery\] Great Pr̥śni has borne in \[Her\] udder,46

\[that is, Her sons, the Maruts, who were born from it\].’47

The ETÁD–YÁD construction of this dvipadā virāj is affected by a discrepancy – or lack of grammatical agreement – between the two pronouns etā́ni and yád. They are of the same gender, but their number is different. Consequently, they cannot 

refer to the same nucleus \( Bezugswort\).48 How then could the numerical difference be accounted for? 

**42** Cf. J&B 2014: 2.892\): “the manly ones who fashioned the solemn utterance and its desirable reward,” \[6b\]. 

**43** Cf. J&B 2014: 2.892\): “who, heeding them, extend the clans \[6c\] and who will reflect upon this, my truth \[6d\].” 

**44** Regarding R̥V 7.7.6, Hettrich \(1988: 570 n.145\) thinks that the correlative function of ETÁD in this relative construction is again “nicht eindeutig”. I would, however, maintain that it is just that, namely eindeutig and unequivocally pointing at those men there, independently of the three subordinate clauses enclosing the same relative pronoun yé, all of which are merely descriptive. 

**45** For the “presentic” usage of the indicative of the perfect ci-két-a/ ci-kit-é \(R̥V 125x\) of the root cet/

cit < PIE ✶ ku̯ei̯t/ ku̯it ‘bemerken, erkennen’ \( LIV 382–383\), see Kümmel 2000: 174–177 s.v. cet ‘bemerken, erkennen, verstehen’. 

**46** For the neuter ū́dhas, exceptionally understood as a locative at R̥V 7.56.4b, see Geldner’s translation \(1951: 2.231\), quoted below, in footnote 52, and his Anmerkung to verse 4b. In the three other places where the case form ū́dhas occurs in the R̥V – at 1.146.2d rehántiy ū́dho aruṣā́so asya, 4.1.19c śúciy ū́dho atr̥ṇan ná gávām, and 8.31.9c sám ū́dho romaśáṁ hato –, it naturally functions as an object-accusative governed by transitive verbs: rehánti “\(they \[the flames\]\) lick”, atr̥ṇat “\(he 

\[Agni\]\) drilled”, and sám . . . hatas “\(the two \[husband-and-wife\]\) slam together” \(J&B\), respectively. 

**47** Pr̥śni, the Maruts’ Mother, is conceived of as a Cow. She has borne \( jabhāra/ jabhre\) an udder and her sons, who were borne in it; but also, if only as an implicit consequence, she has borne \( jajāna/

jajñe\) her sons, who were born from it. 

**48** Nor could yád, if it were accusative and meant ‘which’, form one phrase with ū́dhas ‘udder’ 

\(\[secondary s- stem\] ū́dhas- n. R̥V 5x, ŚS 7x ~ \[primary r-/ n- heteroclitic\] ū́dhar-/ ū́dhan- n. R̥V 45x, ŚS 

✶1x \[\!\]\). Syntactically, a hypothetic relative clause ‘which udder great Pr̥śni has borne’, although meaningful in itself, cannot be brought into harmony with ‘those mysteries’ \( etā́ni . . . niṇyā́ . . . \) of the main sentence in verse a. 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[21]]

Is it due to a venial sloppiness on the part of the poet? Or has it perhaps a 

deeper significance, one intended by the poet, and meant to be understood49 by us, in a way that would suit the intuitive thinker \( dhī́ra- m.\) of verse 4a? 

He, ‘the deeply thinking man’,50 is said to understand those – apparently many – mysteries, only one of which is mentioned in the yád- phrase \(4b\). Clearly, this particular mystery cannot define the more general nature of those; it is apt to exemplify or, at best, symbolically represent them, and thus to fulfill a partially descriptive function, but it could not restrict  them to its own limited particularity.51 

The complete understanding of those mysteries by the insightful dhī́ra-  reaches well beyond that single specimen mentioned in the second decasyllabic half of the stanza; however typical any example may be, it is only one of many. 

The discrepancy between the plural etā́ni and the singular yád – a numerical divergence which led to the \(possibly superfluous\) problem just raised and tentatively solved – could easily be avoided, if yád were declared a conjunction. In that alternative case, our translation of the distich 4ab may run like this: ‘ Those mysteries the deeply thinking man understands, \(one of which \[mysteries\] is\) that great Pr̥śni has borne an udder.’52

However, this fact can scarcely be called a mystery, because for a cow – and 

Great Pr̥śni is a cow, if not The Cow par excellence –, it is the most natural thing on earth to bear an udder. 

\[8\] R̥V 7.63.3cd

eṣá me deváḥ savitā́ cachanda

yáḥ samānáṃ ná praminā́ti dhā́ma //

**49** Or rather, a hidden meaning meant to be “under-understood” \( sous-entendu\). 

**50** The well-attested word dhī́ra- \(R̥V 55x\) is either a substantive meaning ‘the wise one’ – that is, if it were internally derived from an original but unattested ✶ dhīrá- ‘wise’ showing the typical intonation of a rá- adjective built to a root in the low-grade –, or it is based on the frequent root-noun dhī́- f. ‘insight, wisdom’ \(R̥V 273x \[\!\]\), in which case we would again have to do primarily with an adjective \(‘wise’\), secondarily with a substantive \(‘the wise one’\). For the two possibilities separately considered, see W&D 2.2: 849–858, § 684 and § 685. 

**51** In order to be restrictive, the one symbol or example would have to coincide in meaning with 

‘ those \[ many\] mysteries’, but that is excluded insofar as its singular differs in number from their plurality. Cf. ✶Look at those animals there, \( one of\) which has a hunch\!. 

**52** Cf. Geldner 1951: 2.231: “Diese Geheimnisse kennt der Weise, daß die große Pṛśni \(sie \[die Marut\]\) im Euter getragen hat” and J&B 2014: 2.949: “These are the secrets the insightful one perceives: what great Pṛśni bore as her udder” \( my italics\). While Geldner takes yád as the conjunction 

“daß”, J&B take it as the relative pronoun in the sense of “what”. Their translation does not seem to solve the problem raised above, concerning the difference in number between the plural etā́ni 

“these” and the singular yád “what”.

Werner Knobl 

‘ That Heavenly one there \(= the rising Sun\)53

appears \[and appeals\] to me as Heavenly Savitar, 

who does not infringe \(upon\) the common agreement

\(the solemn covenant\) \[of the Ādityas\].’

The relative clause yáḥ samānáṃ ná praminā́ti dhā́ma  may refer to eṣá ‘ that \[\(Heavenly\) Sun\] there’ or to deváḥ savitā́ ‘Heavenly Savitar’. Since one appears \[to me, the poet\] as the other, it doesn’t really matter which of the two is described in this YÁD-phrase; ultimately, they are both concerned: Sūrya – who is explicitly mentioned in the verses 1b \( sū́riyas\), 2b \( sū́riyasya\), and 4c \( sū́riyeṇa\) of this hymn54 – as well as Savitar, whose emergence in 3c is foreshadowed in the compound pra-savītár- \(R̥V 

2x\), attribute of Sūrya,55 in 2a úd uv eti prasavītā́ jánānām ‘And up He moves, \(the Sun\) promoter of the peoples.’56

Whether it is the one or the other, they are both heavenly \( devá- m.\) and would of course abide by their own law \( dhā́man- n. \[R̥V 96x\]\), the common agreement of the Ādityas.57 It is, therefore, not necessary to mention this fact in order to understand the exact there- deictic reference of eṣá to ‘ that \[Sun\]  there’ in the East, to Him who rises bright and radiant ‘from the lap of the Dawns’ \(cf. 3ab vibhrā́jamāna uṣásām upásthād . . . úd eti . . . \), in all His oriental splendor. 

**53** Cf. the first half of this stanza, 3ab vibhrā́jamāna uṣásām upásthād rebháir úd etiy anu-madyámānaḥ “Aus dem Schoße der Uṣas geht er strahlend auf, von den Sängern bejubelt” \(Geldner 1951: 2.239\). 

**54** Rhetorically speaking, these three case-forms of the noun sū́rya- m. \(nominative, genitive, and instrumental, respectively\) exemplify the figure of speech that is called polyptoton. 

**55** In the other place where this agent noun occurs, prasavītár- m. qualifies Savitar, namely at 4.53.6 br̥hátsumnaḥ prasavītā́ nivéśaṇo jágata sthātúr ubháyasya yó vaśī́ /  sá no deváḥ savitā́ śárma yachatuv asmé kṣáyāya trivárūtham áṁhasaḥ “Possessing lofty benevolence, the one who impels forth and causes to settle down, who exerts his will over both the moving world and the stationary, let him, god Savitar, hold out to us shelter providing threefold protection against distress for us and for our dwelling place” \(J&B 2014: 1.638\). 

**56** The adjective deváḥ ‘heavenly’, which stands between eṣá ‘the one there’ and savitā́ ‘the inciter, impeller, instigator’, qualifies both Sūrya and Savitar. For another case of metrical and syntactic ambiguity, see above, the double-faced adverb pradívi at \[5\] R̥V 6.41.3d yásyéśiṣe pradívi yás te ánnam ‘\[That Soma\] of which you are master, and which is your food, from of old.’

**57** In later Sanskrit, Sūrya came to be known as The Āditya, but already in the R̥gveda, we find Him being called ādityá- ‘Son of Aditi’, if only occasionally, at R̥V 1.191.9a/c or 8.101.11ab, for instance. 

Savitar, on the other hand, is not infrequently named together with other Ādityas: Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, Aṁśa, and, most especially, with Bhaga the god ‘\(hereditary\) Share’. For “Sūrya the Āditya par excellence”, see Knobl forthc. 2.

‘Your companion does not want that companionship \(of yours\) there, which \(?\) . . . ’58

Yamī knows that companionship there \( etát sakhiyám\) all too well, because she herself suggested it, if only in vain,59 to her twin brother Yama at the very beginning of their heated dialogue:

‘ And yet, I would have liked

\( even though\) he had gone across the sea, over so many \(\[sea\] miles \[?\]\).’61

**58** For two different translations of the second verse – one by Geldner, the other by J&B –, see below, footnote 67. It is not easy to coordinate etád with yád, unless the latter is taken as a conjunction; cf. Geldner’s “daß” or J&B’s “in that”. Since sálakṣmā  and  víṣurūpā are both feminine in gender, they cannot agree with either of the two neuter pronouns. 

**59** The vanity of her suggestion is implied in the specific character of the perfect optative as a modus irrealis, or hypothetical mood, for which see the following footnote. 

**60** On the intriguing optative of the perfect, which occurs five times in this hymn, R̥V 10.10 \(1a, 3d, 7c, 9b, 12a\), and ought to be understood as a hypothetical mood, see Knobl 2007a: 121–122 n.51 = 

Knobl 2009c: 61–62 n.51, where all the four perfect optatives used by Yamī are quoted and translated in their respective context: \[1\] 1a ā́ . . . vavr̥tyām, \[2\] 3d . . . ā́ viviśyās, \[3\] 7c . . . riricyām, and 

\[4\] 9b . . . ún mimīyāt. The fifth optative of the perfect, sám papr̥cyām, occurs in the emphatic words pronounced by Yama at \[5\] 12a ná vā́ u te tanúvā tanúvaṁ sám papr̥cyām ‘On no account would I have commingled \[my\] body with your body.’ A detailed discussion of this heavily hypermetrical triṣṭubh \(\!\) of no fewer than fourteen syllables \(= T14\) as a nice example of intentional irregularity can be found in Knobl 2007a: 131–135 = Knobl 2009c: 71–75.

**61** In this translation of the phrase purū́ cid arṇaváṃ, the adjective purū́ is understood as a plural \(= purū́ṇi \[ yójanāni?\]\) independent of arṇavám. For the alternative of taking purū́ \(= purú\_u ?\) as a singular qualifying arṇavám, see below, footnote 65.

The following three remarks on different aspects of jaganvā́n are intended to explain why I take the perfect participle in a \[a\] finite, \[b\] concessive, and \[c\] pluperfective sense, and why I render it as “\( even though\) he had gone . . . ”. \(The excursus ends, by way of foregone conclusion, with “it is in vain.”\). 

**Excursus \(1\) on jaganvā́n**

\[a\] Here, the perfect participle jaganvā́n  may be thought to function as a finite verb. This unusual usage is provided for by Pāṇini at Aṣṭādhyāyī 3.2.84 bhūte / 

105 chandasi liṭ / 106 liṭaḥ **k**āna**j** vā / 107 **k**vas**u**ś ca.62 If the participle did not mean ‘he has gone’, we would have to assume that the nominative jaganvā́n replaces an expected accusative ✶ jaganvā́ṁsam qualifying sákhāyam as 

‘having gone’.63 But who will insist on making this assumption, after a better 

solution has been offered? 

\[b\] The concessive meaning of the participle, as here of jaganvā́n \(‘\[ even though\] he had gone’\), is one of many possible connotations a participle, whether present 

or perfect, may implicitly convey, including even causal and final ones.64 In 

addition to that, the implied concessiveness of jaganvā́n  is strongly supported and further emphasized by the adversative particle u in verse a, which verse clearly parses ā́\_**u** cit . . . , and possibly by another u in verse b, if that verse were analyzed as tiráḥ purú/ purū́\_**u** cid . . .  65 The resulting parallelism of the **62** Those are rules valid for Sacred Vedic literature \( chándas- n.\); a few perfect participles functioning as finite verbs in the spoken Vedic language \( bhāṣāyām\) – six, to be exact – are enumerated by Pāṇini at Aṣṭādhyāyī 3.2.108–109: \[1\] upasedivān \(√ sad/✶ sd ‘sit’\), \[2\] anūṣivān \(√ vas/ uṣ 

‘stay \[overnight\]’\), \[3\] upaśuśruvān \(√ śrav/ śru ‘hear, listen to’\); \[4\] upeyivān \(√ ay/ i ‘go, move’\), \[5\] 

anāśvān \(√ aśi ‘eat, consume’\), and \[6\] anūcānas \(√ vac/ uc ‘speak’\). 

Cf. Delbrück 1888: 394, who refers to just one possible case in point, i.e.  dadānás** **at R̥V 5.2.3c** **

dadānó asmā amŕ̥taṃ vipŕ̥kvat** **\(“Ich gebe ihm \[dem Agni?\] das befreiende Lebenselixir” \[Geldner 1951: 2.4\] ~ “Da ich ihm \[Indra?\] gegeben habe den Unsterblichkeitstrank, den unvermischten” 

\[Kümmel 2000: 239\] ~ “as I gave to him my immortal \(soma\) without impurity” \[J&B 2014: 2.663\]\). 

See also Hoffmann 1975: 158–159 \(=** ** KZ** **78 \[1963\]: 94–95\) on the perfect participle** ** anuvidvā́n 

“vollständig kennt” at ŚS 12.2.38cd = 12.2.52cd \(≈ PS 17.47.9cd ≈ 17.48.9cd\), MS 1.6.2: 88.5, KS 7.14: 77.13, and ŚBM 1.5.1.6, as well as Thieme 1971: 1.619 \(=** ** KZ** **78 \[1963\]: 95\). 

**63** Apocope of a syllable, especially at the end of a verse, does happen sometimes. 

**64** For a detailed discussion of 26 Vedic present participles of purpose, all of which have a meaning that I would call “final” \(as in causa finalis\), and thus are expressive of intentionality, see Knobl 2004/2005. 

**65** If the neuter purú/ purū́ were to be read as the singular purú – not as the plural purū́ –, it could qualify arṇavám. A meaning such as ‘much sea’ \(“viel Meer”\) sounds not unlikely; rather 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[25]]

two metrical lines with two times **u** cid would seem to speak in favor of this analysis. And since the phrase particle u expresses opposition, it has a natural tendency to come in pairs. Minimally, with weak contrastive value, . . . u . . . u means ‘ . . . on the one hand, . . . on the other’.66

\[c\] The pluperfect ‘he had gone’ seems logically necessary, because the action of Yama’s former going expressed in the perfect participle jaganvā́n naturally antecedes that of Yamī’s unfulfillable wishing expressed in the perfect optative ā́ . . . vavr̥tyām. Even though this is a hypothetical mood \(‘I would have liked to make \[the companion\] revert \[to acts of companionship\]’\), it still refers to 

the past, if only to a possibility in the past, to one that now has passed beyond possible realization. At the present dramatic moment, the action of effectively 

making her companion Yama revert  to acts of companionship cannot be realized any more by Yamī. However fervent her desire to make him come back 

may be, it is in vain. 

Since Yamī knows the kind of companionship that Yama refers to with the there- deictic d-pronoun, she will of course be aware of its incestuous character, and therefore does not need the description of etát sakhiyám given in the following yád- phrase: sálakṣmā yád víṣurūpā bhávāti.67

\(“vielmehr”\), considering semantics and etymology of purú-/ pūrvī́- “voll” und “viel” \(‘much’ and 

‘many’\), plenitude or multitude would fit the ocean admirably well. 

**66** My translation, “And yet, . . ., \( even though\) . . .”, places a decidedly greater emphasis on the opposition that sets the main sentence off against the subordinate clause, than if I said ‘on the one hand **–** on the other’. 

**67** Cf. the following two translations: “daß Blutsverwandtes \(wie\) Fremdartiges werde” \(Geldner 1951: 3.134\) and “in that she \[=sexual partner\] will have the same “marks” \[=family characteristics\] 

\(though\) dissimilar form \[=gender\]” \(J&B 2014: 3.1382\). 

Here, both** ** lákṣmaṇ-** **n. ‘mark, sign’ \(ŚS 4x\) in** ** sá-lakṣmaṇ-** **\(R̥V 2x\) and** ** rūpá-** **n. ‘color, form’ 

\(R̥V 51x\) in** ** víṣu-rūpa-** **\(R̥V 10x\) seem to have a very special meaning. Apparently, they are based on the habit of a cattle-raising clan or people to “earmark” –** ** akṣ** **\( akṣ-ṇo-ti\); cf. the verbal adjective** **

aṣṭá-** **\(R̥V 2x\) in** ** nír-aṣṭa-** **“verschnittene \(Stiere\)” \[Geldner\] at 1.33.6c and in** ** aṣṭa-karṇī́-  f. “\(cows\) with cut-branded ears” \[J&B\] at 10.62.7c – or to “brand” their animals. The marking – even though, primarily, it will be a sign of ownership – would also help prevent incest among the cattle; and avoidance of inbreeding is essential to a healthy and prolific livestock. 

Taking up a provisional attempt that I had made in my Freiburg paper \(Knobl 2007b\), I would again try to translate R̥V 10.10.2ab in a somewhat periphrastic way: ‘Nicht will dein Partner** ** die** **\[Art von\] Partnerschaft** ** da** **mit dir, \[eine Partnerschaft,\]** ** bei** ** der** **die mit demselben Kennzeichen \[wie ihr Partner\] \( sá-lakṣmaṇ-** **f.\) zu einer würde, deren Farbe \[von der des Partners\] abwiche \( víṣu-rūpā-f.\)** **\[und mit der die geschlechtliche Vereinigung folglich erlaubt wäre\].’ As a matter of fact, that change – from ‘one with the same marks’ to ‘one with different colors’ – is purely hypothetical; if it were possible, there would be no incest.

\[11\] R̥V 10.10.8ab \(≈ ŚS 18.1.9ab ≈ PS 18.57.9ab\)

ná tiṣṭhanti ná ní miṣantiy eté

devā́nāṁ spáśa ihá yé cáranti /

‘They do not stand still, they do not close their eyes, 

those \(men\) there, who circulate here as spies of the gods.’

This is one of the 27 examples I have discussed in an as-yet-unpublished article on 

“ETÁD as subject in sentence-final position” \(Knobl forthc. 3\). To be sure, in this particular case we could perhaps consider that eté ‘ those . . . there’, though standing at the end of the first line, may be taken together with devā́nāṁ spáśaḥ ‘spies of the gods’ of the second, and that it starts a new sentence; but this is not what I would seriously suggest.68

There is a very distinct opposition between the there- deictic d-pronoun eté 

‘ those \[spies\]’ and the here- deictic clause ihá yé cáranti ‘who circulate here’.69 It is difficult to conceive that this fact should be necessary in order to understand the exact reference of ‘ those \[spies\]’, who are already characterized as being on the move \( ná tiṣṭhanti\) and keeping their eyes open \( ná ní miṣanti\). Rather, this is additional information calculated to strike fear into Yamī’s heart.70

**68** It is not at all clear to me whether J&B take eté as \(explicative, epexegetic\) subject of the first two sentences in verse a, ná tiṣṭhanti ná ní miṣanti, or as belonging \(in enjambment\) with the phrase at the beginning of verse b, devā́nāṁ spáśaḥ. See their translation \(2014: 3.1383\): “They  do not stand still; they  do not blink – the spies of the gods who roam about here” \( my italics\). With reasonable dubitation, one may ask: Is it the double “they” that renders eté, or the article in “the spies”? In either case, the there- deixis of the d-pronoun ETÁD has remained unexpressed. 

**69** The anapæst of ihá yé  represents the metrical foot that is most frequently met with in the break of a trimetric verse. This position would also allow for a metrically and semantically equivalent yá imé \(= yé\_imé\). A comparable, if reverse, YÁD–ETÁD construction can be found at R̥V 10.71.9 imé yé . . . tá eté . . ., for which stanza see below, example \[14\]. 

**70** In my partly published Freiburg paper \(Knobl 2007b\), I wrote: “Diese warnenden Worte des Yama, mit denen er der Zwillingsschwester ihre obsessiven Inzestgedanken auszureden versucht, sind wie mit drohender Gebärde gesprochen. Denn dadurch, dass die Rede wechselt vom da- deiktischen eté – das die göttlichen Späher da noch in einigermaßen sicherem Abstand zu halten geeignet ist – zum hier- deiktischen ihá in dem Sätzchen ihá yé cáranti ‘welche hier patrouillieren’, rücken die spähenden Götterspione dem in Versuchung schwebenden Geschwisterpaar auf einmal beängstigend auf den Leib. Nicht, dass sich Yamī durch die von himmlischer Seite ihnen drohende Gefahr etwa beeindrucken ließe. Vielmehr bemüht sie sich weiter nach Kräften, den ungeniert geliebten Zwillingsbruder zu verführen.” 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic

Und \(andererseits\) der  Becher da, welcher den Göttern zum Trinken dient,73 –

an dem berauschen sich die unsterblichen Götter. \(Knobl 2018: 114\)

Naturally, the drinking vessel there \( eṣá . . . camasás\) is not only different, but also at some distance farther away from the drinking vessel here \( imám . . . camasám\). And the syntax suggests that in this particular context, the there- deictic pronoun ETÁD 

enjoys an even greater independence than in any of the other contexts discussed 

in the present section; because, all by themselves, the two relative/correlative pronouns yás . . . tásmin – the first of which follows immediately after eṣá – achieve a **71** The third/reduplicated aorist ji-hvar-a-t \(R̥V 1x\) corresponds to the present causative hvār-aya-ti / 

hvāl-aya-ti, which seems to be attested only two times in Brāhmaṇa prose. Of this rare causative, 

\[1\] the present participle ava-hvārayant- occurs at JB 1.79: 5–6 tam \[= droṇakalaśam\]  avahvārayan dakṣiṇā nirūhet, and \[2\] the verbal adjective sáṁ-hvārita- is found at ŚBM 1.2.5.16 \(≈ ŚBK 2.2.3.15\) sā́ 

vái paścā́d várīyasī syāt /  mádhye sáṁhvāritā púnaḥ purástād urvī́\_evám iva hí yóṣāṃ praśáṁsanti pr̥thúśroṇir vímr̥ṣṭāntarāṁsā mádhye saṃgrāhyā̀ . . . “It \(the altar \[ védi- f.\!\]\) should be broader on the west side, contracted in the middle, and broad again on the east side; for thus shaped they praise a woman: ‘broad about the hips, somewhat narrower between the shoulders, and contracted in the middle \(or, about the waist\)’. . .” \(Eggeling\). For the gerundive saṃgrāhyà-, allegedly meaning 

“contracted” \(\!\) according to Eggeling, see, however, B&R 7.541 s.v., Bedeutung 1: “zu umfassen, zu umfangen”, with reference to our ŚB passage. That ‘praiseworthy’ \( praśáṁsyā\) woman’s waist would prove so excessively slender that it could be clasped or grasped \(“embraced”\) all around with two open hands at once. 

**72** This translation \(“der . . . lieb ist”\) seems to presuppose an original relative clause; and in fact, I am tempted to read priyó yó as the first part of a subordinate sentence in which the second yó would have been lost by haplology. However, in contradistinction to the subscript ca  in verse c – 

which is metrically necessary and may as well be pronounced \(see the following footnote\) –, the expected relative pronoun yás in verse b is syntactically necessary, although metrically redundant, and should only be thought, not  pronounced. For another possible case of mental suppletion, see Knobl forthc. 5. 

**73** For the subscript ca before camasó, which I added in order to restore the metrical pattern of a regular triṣṭubh, see Knobl 2018: 114 n.31. The haplological loss of a syllable \( ca camasó → camasó\), leading to a catalectic verse, may be supposed to have happened already in the original, whether it was intended by the poet or not. N&H’s suggestion, metrical note on R̥V 10.16.8c \(1994: 542\), to the effect that this triṣṭubh line of ten syllables \(T10\) has to be read with an exceptional cæsura after three \(\!\), is but a Notbehelf  and Verlegenheitslösung, only provisionally acceptable – as long as no better solution has been found. 

**28** 

Werner Knobl 

complete YÁD– TÁD construction of their own. The poet seems to use the pronoun eṣá almost as a there- deictic exclamation or interjection,74 by means of which he would just point at the second vessel, saying: ‘and there\!  that beaker, which . . . ’, instead of ‘and that beaker there, which is the drinking vessel of the gods \( devapā́na-\)’.75

\[13\] R̥V 10.50.6ab

etā́ víśvā sávanā tūtumā́ kr̥ṣe

svayáṁ sūno sahaso yā́ni dadhiṣé /

All those soma-pressings you \[o Agni\] have made \( kr̥ṣe\) powerful \( tūtumā́\), which \(soma-pressings\) you, o Son of Strength, have made yours. 

While in this translation,76 tūtumā́ is understood as an adjective qualifying ‘all those soma-pressings’ \( etā́ víśvā sávanā\) as ‘powerful’,77 and kr̥ṣe as a verb form \(‘you have made’\),78 in J&B’s alternative rendering, which is based on a contracted tūtumā́kr̥ṣe, the first word, taken as tūtumā̆, is considered a verb form \(“We have made . . . powerful”\)79 and the remaining ā́kr̥ṣe as a dative-infinitive \(“to draw \(you\) here”\).80

**74** In a manner similar to French voilà\!. 

**75** As is sometimes the case, compounds may be made up of words that are not yet attested individually. Thus, pā́na- does not occur before the AV \(ŚS 1x\), while deva-pā́na- is attested earlier, and also more frequently \(R̥V 5x, ŚS 2x\). 

**76** Cf. Geldner 1951: 3.211: “All diese Somaopfer hast du wirkungsvoll gemacht.” 

**77** The adjective tūtumá- occurs only twice in the R̥V, at 10.50.5d and 6a, in almost identical verses; see Lubotsky 1997: 1.600b. To be sure, tradition reads the last two words of 5d and 6a as . . . tūtumā́ 

kr̥ṣe; cf. the oldest interpretation of the saṁhitā-pāṭha-, that is, Śākalya’s pada-pāṭha-: tūtumā́ /  

kr̥ṣe // .  We would be free, however, to contract the two words into tūtumā́kr̥ṣe, if this contraction led to a meaningful re-analysis. The only alternative that seems to offer itself is the one J&B have chosen, i.e. to read tūtumā̆\_ā́kr̥ṣe. For my criticism of this reading, see below. 

**78** It would appear that Geldner was the first to identify kr̥ṣé \(R̥V 2x\) and  kr̥ṣe \(R̥V 3x\) as a perfect without reduplication; see his note on R̥V 8.3.20d “kr̥ṣé = cakr̥ṣé, Perf. ohne Redupl.”. Cf. Lubotsky 1997: 1.444a, where kr̥ṣé is hesitantly qualified as “nonce form\[ation\] \(?\)”. The regularly reduplicated 2nd person singular of the middle – cakr̥ṣé \(R̥V 6x\) or cakr̥ṣe \(R̥V 4x\) – is just a little more frequent. 

**79** According to Lubotsky 1997: 1.600b, the perfect of tavi/ tū < PIE ✶ teu̯h2/ tuh2 ‘schwellen, stark werden’ \( LIV 639–640\) is attested only once in the indicative \( tūtāva\) and thrice in the injunctive \( tūtos 1x, tūtot 2x\), unless these three forms belong to the third aorist, which seems, however, unlikely. See Whitney 1889: 312 § 868a, who first enumerates all the \(12\) very parallel verb forms that were considered reduplicated aorists: tū-to-t, du-dro-t, dū-dho-t, nū-no-t, pi-pre-t, pu-po-t, mī-me-t, yū-yo-t, śi-śre-t, si-ṣe-t, su-ṣo-t, su-sro-t, and then goes on to conclude the paragraph by saying: “Few of these forms possess a necessarily causative or decidedly aoristic value, and it is very doubtful whether they should not be assigned to the perfect system.” No doubt, they should. 

**80** Cf. J&B 2014: 3.1458: “We have made all these soma-pressings powerful, to draw \(you\) here.” 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[29]]

However, the regular intonation of ✶ ā-kr̥ṣ-, if that compound existed at all,81 

would have to be ✶ ā-kŕ̥ṣ-, not † ā́-kr̥ṣ-. See the many examples of root-compounds with a preposition as first member that occur in the R̥gveda, all of which carry the tone on the root-syllable.82

Here, I find it difficult to decide whether the subordinate clause svayáṁ . . . 

yā́ni dadhiṣé  is limitative or not.83 If Agni has made those soma-pressings strong and effective, does this not mean that he must have adopted and incorporated 

them first? Or could it be that he has made them his own only sometimes, and 

that therefore the YÁD–phrase would restrict the strengthening effect of Agni to a limited number of cases? Formulated thus, the two alternatives sound unequally 

convincing. And after some hesitation, I am inclined to consider it more likely that adoption or incorporation of the soma-pressings by Agni is a necessary condition 

for his action, and that the subordinate clause is merely descriptive, not restrictive. 

**2  The YÁD–ETÁD**** Construction in the R̥gveda**

This is the inverted version of the ETÁD–YÁD construction, and it occurs even less frequently than the one just discussed, which is already very rare.84 Here too, the YÁD– phrase contains a verb or two: \[14\] yé . . . cáranti \(a\), \[15\] yád . . . vádati \(a\), yát . . . kr̥ṇóti \(b\); and, as in examples \[5\] yás te ánnam \(d\) and \[12\] yáś ca camasó \(c\) of section A., we also find a noun – or rather, two – together with the relative pronoun in one and the same subordinate clause: \[14\] yé . . . \(a\) brāhmaṇā́so . . . 

sutékarāsaḥ \(b\). 

**81** The root karṣ/ kr̥ṣ ‘draw, drag, plow’ \(class I present kárṣ-a-ti \[R̥V 4x, ŚS 2x\] / class VI present kr̥ṣ-á-ti \[R̥V 4x, ŚS 2x\]\) < PIE ✶ ku̯els ‘Furchen ziehen, einfurchen’ \( LIV 388–389\) does not seem to form any root-compound in Vedic. Nor is the root-noun kŕ̥ṣ- attested. 

**82** Suffice it to mention just four of the more frequent among the many dative-infinitives that occur in the R̥V:  abhi-cákṣ-e \(3x\), vi-cákṣ-e \(6x\), ā-dhr̥ṣ-e \(7x\), ā-rábh-e \(4x\). For the intonation of root-compounds in general, see Scarlata 1999. 

**83** Cf. the following two translations: “welche du . . . selbst dir angeeignet hast” \(Geldner 1951: 3.211\) and “which you have \(now\) taken into your own self” \(J&B 2014: 3.1458\). 

**84** I am grateful to George Dunkel for having asked about this inversion of the ETÁD– YÁD construction, for which no example had been given in the paper that I presented at the 2019 Atharvaveda conference in Zurich. My brief impromptu reply to his question will have to be refined in the present section, where two exemplary R̥V stanzas are discussed, together with their AV parallels. In the course of my discussion, I will quote a few German passages that were formulated earlier on, in partly published \(Knobl 2018\), partly unpublished \(Knobl 2007b\) texts. 

This section of the paper is offered to professor Dunkel, as a token of respect and admiration.

may be compared with the negative compound á-brāhmaṇa- m. “non-Brahman” \(W&L\), which first occurs in the AV \(ŚS 5.17.8b; 11.1.32b; 12.4.43d, and 12.4.44c = 46c\). In Vedic, this compound simply means ‘one who is not a poet-priest’; it does not yet seem to be attested in the sense of ‘bad/unworthy brāhmaṇá-’. According to W&D 1957: II 1.79 § 31d, a-brāhmaṇa- meaning “der kein rechter Brahmane ist” \(“mit Verneinung der prägnant gefaßten Bedeutung des Hinterglieds” \[\!\]\) only occurs in classical Sanskrit. See, however, the early Vedic á-dhenu- f. ‘milk-cow not yielding milk’ \(R̥V 

1.117.20a, 10.71.5c; ŚS 6.59.1c ≈ PS 19.14.10c\), and cf. German Undichter ‘unechter Dichter, \(Dich-terling, Poetaster\)’, Unmensch ‘unmenschlicher Mensch’, or Unwetter ‘\(extrem\) schlechtes Wetter’. 

**86** If the negative phrase ná sutékarāsaḥ really referred to certain, inadequate poet-priests as the ones “who do not perform in the soma-pressing” \(J&B\) or “die nicht bei dem Soma mitwirken” 

\(Geldner\), would this not mean that the unique compound suté-kara- \(R̥V 1x\) is considered an agent noun? However, if it were that, a regular ✶ sute-kārá- should be expected instead; cf. -kārá- m. 

\(- kārī́- f.\) as second member in some 20 comparable oxytone compounds occurring in the Saṁhitās: 

\[1\] brahma-kārá- \(R̥V 6.29.4c\), \[2\] medhā-kārá- \(R̥V 10.91.8a\), \[3\] yut-kārá- \(R̥V 10.103.2b\); \[4\] aila-ba-kārá- \(ŚS 11.2.30a ≈ PS 16.106.10a\); \[5\] iṣu-kārá- \(VSM 30.7\), \[6\] jyā-kārá- \(VSM 30.7\), \[7\] dha-nuṣ-kārá- \(VSM 30.7\), \[8\] maṇi-kārá- \(VSM 30.7\), \[9\] ratha-kārá- \(VSM 30.6\), \[10\] surā-kārá- \(VSM 

30.11\), \[11\] hiraṇya-kārá- \(VSM 30.17\), etc. For another -kārá- compound the first member of which stands in a case-form, see \[12\] bhakṣam-kārá- \(MS 4.7.3: 96.14\). 

The actual accentuation of the first member suggests that** ** suté-kara-** **is a bahuvrīhi; the form of the second, that we may have to do with** ** kará-** **‘hand’ \(R̥V 2x \[1.116.13a and 10.67.6b\], ŚS 1x 

\[12.2.2b\]\). The compound could, therefore, rather refer to one ‘who** ** has a hand** **in the soma-pressing’. For the meaning, cf. the root-compound** ** sute-gŕ̥bh-** **\(R̥V 1x \[5.44.5a\]\) “in den Soma greifend \(um zu schöpfen\)” \(B&R 7.1055\): suté** **\[ karéṇa** = ** hástena\]** ** gr̥bhṇāti**/** gr̥hṇāti** **\[ gráham** **\(\!\)\]. In this compound, neither the direct object \( gráha-** **m. ‘scoop’ \[R̥V 1x, ŚS 3x\]\), nor the organ or instrument of scooping** **\( kará-** **m. ‘hand’ \[R̥V 2x, ŚS 1x\] or** ** camasá-** **m. ‘ladle’ \[R̥V 23x, ŚS 8\+✶3x\]\) are explicitly mentioned; they are, however, necessarily implied in the action, tacitly taking part in it as the** ** kāraka-** **\(act-participant\)** ** karmaṇ-** **and** ** karaṇa-** **respectively, the locative** ** suté-** **\(literally: ‘in the \[pressing process of the\] pressed \[soma-drink\]’\) collaborating as the** ** adhi-karaṇa-**. **

**87** For the two different meanings of the adjective á-pra-jajñi-: either ‘ignorant’, if it is based on the verbal compound pra-jñā, or ‘unproductive’, if it belongs with pra-jani, see Knobl 2018: 117 n.42.

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[31]]

Even though the two d-pronouns imé and eté, by virtue of their marked demonstrative divergence, stand in clear opposition to one another, imé yé and tá eté are, none the less, correferential, insofar as they separately point at the same group of persons: first, at these, who are here, and then, at  those, who are there; but both of them – these as well as those – are the identical unpoetic poets or unpriestly priests.89

\[15\] R̥V 10.165.4 \(≈ PS 19.27.11; 4ab ≈ ŚS 6.29.1bc, 4d = ŚS 6.28.3d\)

yád úlūko vádati moghám etád

yát kapótaḥ padám agnáu kr̥ṇóti /

yásya dūtáḥ práhita eṣá etát

Was der Uhu \( da\) tönt, nichtig ist das \( da\);90

welche Fußspur der Tauber \( da\) \[in der Asche\] am Feuer macht, 

\[nichtig ist auch die \( da\)\]. 

Ehre soll sein dem Yama, dem Tode, 

als wessen Bote ausgesandt der da das da \[tut\]. \(Knobl 2007b\)91

“Das maskuline eṣás ‘ der da’ in Vers c meint ebenso den Uhu \( úlūka- m.\) in a wie den Tauber \( kapóta- m.\) in b. Und das danebenstehende Neutrum etád ‘ das da’ 

bezieht sich sowohl auf yád . . . vádati ‘was er \( der Uhu \[ da\]\) tönt’ als auch auf yát . . . 

padám . . . kr̥ṇóti ‘welche Fußspur er \( der Tauber \[ da\]\) macht.’92

**89** “Diese \(= die Undichter und Unpriester\) werden zwar zunächst, ganz neutral und objektiv, als 

‘ die hier’ angesprochen, da sie offenbar an demselben Ort versammelt sind wie all die anderen zum dichterischen Wettstreit angetretenen Brahmanen. Aber dann distanziert sich der Dichter dieser Strophe mit ‘ die da’ von ihnen, weil sie eben doch nicht richtig dazugehören, jedenfalls nicht zu ihm und seinesgleichen. Aufgrund ihres inkompetenten und also auch unkollegialen Verhaltens haben sie sich seine da- deiktische Abweisung  zugezogen. Das D-Pronomen ETÁD  ist also hier auch distanzierend-despektierlich gebraucht.” \(Knobl 2018: 118, comment on example \[12\], slightly modified\). 

**90** The main sentence moghám etád in 4a, with the there- deictic pronoun as subject in final position – for which see Knobl forthc. 3, where some thirty examples of ETÁD placed at the end of a verse or sentence are discussed – and with an adverb as fronted predicate, could also mean ‘ let  that be in vain’, if the imperative astu of verse 4d were anticipated. Cf. Geldner \(1951: 3.392\): “das soll eitel sein”, but J&B \(2014: 3.1646\): “that comes to nothing” \( my italics\). Actually, the indicative may be felt to have a greater impact than the imperative. 

**91** This translation and the following remarks are taken from the unpublished part of my Freiburg paper \(Knobl 2007b\). Cf. the rendering of that somewhat complicated stanza into English \(Knobl 2003: 5 = Knobl 2009c: 143\): “What sound the owl makes, that be in vain; and what footprint the dove makes \[in the ashes\] at the fireside, \[ that, too, be in vain\]. Obeisance be to him – as whose envoy that \[owl\] \( that \[dove\]\), which has been sent out, \[makes\] that \[sound\] \( that \[footprint\]\) – to Yama, to Death\!”. 

**92** Unfortunately, the German vocabulary does not seem to allow for using a neuter noun as a translation word of Vedic padá- n. ‘footfall, footprint, footstep, footpath’ \(R̥V 109x\). While the two 

**32** 

Werner Knobl 

Es sieht nun zwar zunächst so aus, als erschöpfe sich etád des ersten Satzes – 

yád úlūko vádati moghám etád ‘Was der Uhu tönt, nichtig ist das’ – in seiner korrel-ativen Funktion. Aber der stärker da- deiktische Gebrauch von eṣás und etád in Vers c macht es wahrscheinlich, dass auch schon etád in Vers a so aufzufassen ist und eine Übersetzung ‘Was der Uhu \( da\) tönt, nichtig ist das \( da\)’ ihre Berechtigung hat. 

Von dem dreimaligen ETÁD in dieser Strophe lässt sich abschließend noch fol-gendes sagen: Mit der distanzierenden Funktion des da- deiktischen Pronomens93 

soll offenbar eine apotropäische Wirkung erzielt werden. Zugleich mit der vom Wunsch beseelten Behauptung, dass Schrei des Uhus und Schritt des Taubers verge-blich geschrien und geschritten seien, rückt allein schon der Gebrauch des Pro-

nomens der mittleren Distanz sie als das da in eine gewisse, weit weniger gefährli-che Ferne, ja wird die Bedrohung durch die beiden Unglücksvögel und Todesboten 

womöglich ganz von uns abgewendet.” \(Knobl 2007b\)

It is on account of a remarkable surplus of meaning – brought about by the 

special there- deictic character, which so conspicuously distinguishes ETÁD – that this pronoun transcends the purely correlative function. Although, referentially, ETÁD partly depends on the YÁD– phrase, and therefore is, to a certain extent, defined and limited by it, the greater demonstrative force of the there- deictic pronoun guarantees a partial independence of the triple ETÁD from the three subordinate clauses.94

In this rare and precious example, it is not only the more emphatic there- deixis that makes the difference, but also the added disparaging connotation of ETÁD.95

inauspicious bird-names “der Uhu” and “der Tauber” – masculine nouns that happen to be available in the language – are congeneric with Vedic úlūka- m. ‘owl’ \(R̥V 1x\) and kapóta- m. ‘dove’ \(R̥V 

6x\) respectively, ‘ die Fußspur’ \(or, ‘ die  Fußstapfe’\) is as generically different from padá- n. as ‘ der Fußabdruck’ would be. I wish we could make the neuter ‘ das Füßchen’ mean ‘footprint’. If that were possible, I should feel free to render verse 4b yát kapótaḥ padám agnáu karóti in a more padá- fitting way: ‘welches “Füßchen” der Tauber \( da\) \[in der Asche\] am Feuer macht, \[nichtig ist auch das \( da\)\].’

**93** This particular distancing – and, as a result, derogatory – function of the there- deictic d-pronoun is a quite natural consequence of its pointing at a certain distance. In a separate section of Knobl 2007b, two dozen examples taken from the R̥V are quoted in proof of a depreciatory connotation that ETÁD occasionally has. Cf. also Knobl 2018: 108 with n.6. 

**94** By contrast, in the YÁD– TÁD construction of the second distich, R̥V 10.165.4cd yásya dūtáḥ . . .  

tásmai yamā́ya . . . ‘ whose messenger . . ., to that Yama . . .’, TÁD is entirely dependent on YÁD. 

Obeisance must be made to Yama\(=Death\), insofar as the two sinister birds, the owl and the dove, are His ominous messengers. The poet’s respect or reverence is conditioned by their threatening appearance, the owl’s hooting and the dove’s footing. 

**95** For a more or less reviling / debasing / degrading / denigrating shade of meaning the there- deictic d-pronoun may sometimes convey, see above, footnote 93, and the references given there. 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[33]]

**3  Split**** or Double**** Reference of ETÁD**** in R̥gveda** **and Atharvaveda**

Before discussing, in the next section \(D.\), the ETÁD–yád  construction first occurring in the Atharvaveda – a construction that is significantly different from the ETÁD–YÁD construction of both R̥V and AV–, I will first take up two couplets and one stanza of the Yama-and-Yamī dialog, R̥V 10.10.3ab \(= ŚS 18.1.2ab ≈ PS 18.57.3ab\), R̥V 10.10.11cd \(= ŚS 18.1.12cd ≈ PS 18.58.2cd\), and ŚS 18.1.14 \(≈ PS 18.58.3ab, 4cd\), where the d-pronoun etád functions in a twofold way, both as that and as this, anaphorically as well as cataphorically, at one and the same time.96

In the ultimately vain attempt to seduce her twin half-brother Yama,97 lovesick and languishing Yamī resorts to the gods, early on in the dialogue-hymn R̥V 10.10, with the apparent intention to claim the gods’– moral or immoral? – support for 

her seductive efforts. 

Yama formulates his blunt refusal of her amorous advances in verse 2a ná te 

sákhā sakhiyáṃ vaṣṭiy etát ‘Your companion does not want that \[immoral\] companionship \(of yours\) there.’98 Briskly reacting to that denial, Yamī has recourse, in the following stanza, to the will of a higher authority, to one that could be expected to carry greater conviction than her own desire. This is what she says in that distich:

\[16\] R̥V 10.10.3ab \(= ŚS 18.1.3ab ≈ PS 18.57.3ab\)

uśánti ghā té amŕ̥tāsa etád

ékasya cit tyajásam mártiyasya /

‘The immortals do want \[just\] that – namely this –:

an heir of the one-and-only mortal \[on earth\].’99

**96** One part of the present section is based on a footnote in my mind-reading article \(Knobl 2007a: 116 n.32 = Knobl 2009c: 56 n.32\); another part, on one of the three as-yet-unpublished papers I presented at the 14th World Sanskrit Conference in Kyoto \(Knobl 2009a\). 

**97** When I say “ultimately vain”, I do not mean to contradict the fact that from the very beginning of this hymn, i.e. already in the first verse of the first stanza, at 10.10.1a, the futility of Yamī’s wish-ful trying is implied in the optative of the perfect ā́ . . . vavr̥tyām ‘I would have liked \[however \( u\)\] 

to make \[my companion\] revert \[to acts of companionship\]’, if that optative is properly understood as a hypothetical mood; see above, footnote 60. 

**98** For a discussion of the ETÁD– YÁD construction in the distich R̥V 10.10.2ab, see above, example \[10\]. 

**99** And she means to say in this indirect way: ‘Procreative love is precisely the sort of companionship that I, Yamī, would have desired to enjoy with you, Yama.’ The ‘heir’ \( tyajás- m. \[R̥V 1x\], which is internally derived from  tyájas- n. ‘the leaving behind, dereliction, abandonment’ \[R̥V 9x\]\), mentioned in 3b, refers to the same male descendent that was strangely called pitúr nápāt- ‘grandson of the father’ in 1c. 

**34** 

Werner Knobl 

To be sure, we may interpret the demonstrative force of etád  as functioning in two different directions: as that it refers back to what preceded \(to the left \[←\] or above 

\[↑\]\), as this it points forward at what will follow \(to the right \[→\] or below \[↓\]\).100 

Finally, however, both this and that indicate one and the same person, the male descendent wanted by the immortals as ‘an heir of the one-and-only mortal \[on 

earth\].’

The pronoun etád appears to display a two-directional – split or double – and, therefore, diverging reference also in the words that Yamī aims at Yama in this 

second distich:

\[17\] R̥V 10.10.11cd \(= ŚS 18.1.12cd ≈ PS 18.58.2cd\)

kā́mamūtā bahúv etád rapāmi

tanúvā me tanúvaṁ sám pipr̥gdhi //

‘Moved by desire, I keep babbling that – namely this –:

“Do commingle \[your\] body with my body\!”.’101

In functioning as that, etád refers \(anaphorically \[↑\] or leftward \[←\]\) back to what was meant by the same etád in verse 2a ná te sákhā sakhiyáṃ vaṣṭiy etát ‘Your companion \[o Yamī\] does not want that \[immoral, incestuous\] companionship \(of yours\) there.’102

**100** It is very convenient that in English we are allowed to distinguish between that and this in a two-directional way: that pointing backward or leftward, this pointing forward or rightward; cf. 

The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: “To be, or not to be: that is the question” \(III 1\) on the one hand, and, on the other, “This above all: to thine owne selfe be true” \(I 3\). 

**101** Literally, bahú . . .  rapāmi means ‘I babble much’, the adverb ‘much’ in the iterative sense of 

‘many times over, again and again’. The frequentative meaning, as it may also be called, could have been expressed by the intensive ✶ rārapīmi as well; cf. rārapīti at R̥V 6.3.6b śocíṣā rā**˅**rapīti mi-trámahāḥ ‘He \(Agni\) chatters-and-prattles with his flame’, in a verse displaying a mid-word cæsura of a very rare kind, of one that is represented by only five intensive formations – three finite verb forms \(\[1\] the indicative rā**˅**rapīti, \[2\] the injunctive davi**˅**dyot, and \[3\] the subjunctive par**˅**pharat\), 

\[4\] a participle \( már**˅**mr̥jatas\), and \[5\] a substantivized adjective \( cár**˅**caram\) –; for a detailed discussion of these forms, see Knobl 2021: 175ff. 

For the neuter singular** ** bahú** **\(R̥V 7x, ŚS 13\+✶1x\) functioning as an** ** adverb** **only once in the R̥gveda, see Knobl 2007a: 71 n.77 = Knobl 2009c: 131 n.77. For a few examples of adverbial** ** bahú** **

in the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā – at PS 3.37.9d** ** atho tvā rodayān bahu** **“et ensuite ils te feront beaucoup pleurer” and PS 7.13.14b = 15.19.12b** ** ichantīḥ prayutaṃ bahu** **“eagerly seeking out the unsuspecting person” –, see Spiers 2020: 545–546 and Griffiths 2009: 396. Delbrück 1888: 185–186 mentions a single occurrence of the adverb in Vedic prose, i.e. at ŚBM 4.1.5.14** ** bahú manuṣyèṣu sáṁsr̥ṣṭam** **

acāriṣṭam** **‘You two \[Aśvins\] moved** ** much** **about \[as divine physicians\] among men, in promiscuous contact \[with them\].’ 

**102** Shall we render te in R̥V 10.10.2a two times: once as ‘ your \[companion\]’ and once as ‘\[ that companionship\] of yours \[ there\]’? According to what I have said above, in footnote 32, with regard to the you- deixis sometimes inherent to the there- deixis of ETÁD – namely that te in \[1\] R̥V 1.31.18ab 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[35]]

In functioning as this, etád refers \(cataphorically \[↓\] or rightward \[→\]\) to the following urgent request explicitly stating, for clarity’s sake, the contents of that: 

‘Do commingle \[your\] body with my body\!’

\[18\] ŚS 18.1.14 \(≈ PS 18.58.3ab/4cd; ab ≈ R̥V 10.10.12ab\)

ná vā́ u te tanū́ṃ tanvā̀ sáṃ papr̥cyāṃ

pāpám āhur yáḥ svásāraṃ nigácchāt /

ásaṃyad etán mánaso hr̥dó me

bhrā́tā svásuḥ śáyane yác cháyīya //

‘Not at all would I have mixed \[my\] body with your body;103

evil they call \[him\] who would come down on \[his\] sister.104

This – namely that – \[would be\] discordant \( ásaṃyat\) to my mind and heart, that I as \[your\] brother should be lying there \( śáyīya\) in \[my\] sister’s lair \( śáyane\).’105

Because of the ETÁD–YÁD construction in the second distich \(14cd\), this stanza could have been quoted in section A. It has, however, its proper place here, in 

section C.; not only does stanza \[18\] belong to the same hymn as the distichs \[16\] 

and \[17\] – that is, to the Yama-and-Yamī dialog –, but also is the \( two-directional\) function of etád in 14c yet another good example of the “split or double reference” 

this d-pronoun sometimes displays. 

and \[3\] R̥V 3.33.8ab, if it were added to the pronoun, would be superfluous –, we should take te in R̥V 10.10.2a primarily with sákhā ‘ your companion’, and only secondarily with sakhiyám . . .  etát 

‘ that companionship \( of yours\)  there’. 

**103** For the optative of the perfect as a hypothetical mood \(or, modus irrealis\), see above, footnotes 60 and 97. 

**104** The distich ŚS 18.1.14ab – showing the secondary accusative tanū́m \(for tanúvam\) in a – is to be compared with the more original couplet R̥V 10.10.12ab \(≈ PS 18.58.3ab\)  ná vā́ u te tanúvā tanúvaṁ 

sám papr̥cyāṃ pāpám āhur yáḥ svásāraṃ nigáchāt “No, I would never commingle my body with your body. Evil they call \[him\] who should come down on his sister” \(Knobl 2007a: 131 = Knobl 2009c: 71; ibid.: 131–135 = 71–75, the drastically hypermetrical triṣṭubh \[T14\] \(\!\) of pāda a is interpreted as an irregularity likely to be intended by the poet, who may have ventured it for the sake of creating a surplus of meaning\). 

The subsequent two verses, ŚS 18.1.14cd, have no parallel in the R̥gveda. 

**105** Or else, ‘if I . . . were to be lying there’, because we could understand the optative śáyīya as a potential mood. For the there-deictic \(\!\), de-particular \(\!\) – and not only “stative” – Vedic root śay/ śi 

‘to be lying there’ \(R̥V 51x, ŚS 29x\) < PIE k̑ei̯/ k̑i ‘\[ da\]liegen’ \(cf. LIV 320\), see Knobl 2009b. 

ŚS 18.1.14d** ** śáyane** . . . ** śáyīya** **‘\[that\] I should be lying there in a \[sister’s\] lair’ – the intransitive verb being construed with a cognate noun in the** ** locative** **– is an etymological construction of a rather rare kind. For a similar example, see above, in the comment on \[6\]: R̥V 7.7.5ab** ** ásādi** . . . ** nr̥sá-dane “\[Agni\] has been seated at the seat of men” \(J&B 2014: 2.892\). As here, at R̥V 7.7.5ab, ‘seated’ 

and ‘seat’ are related through a common origin, so there, at ŚS 18.1.14d, ‘lying’ and ‘lair’ \(German 

“Lager”\). More frequent is the construction of a transitive verb with a cognate** ** accusative, such as** **

tántraṃ tanvate** **at R̥V 10.71.9d, for which see above, example \[14\]. 

**36** 

Werner Knobl 

In order better to understand what happens in the three R̥V or AV passages 

quoted above, at \[16\] 10.10.3ab, \[17\] 10.10.11cd, and \[18\] ŚS 18.1.14, we may perhaps compare the fifth and last stanza of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s poem “Selige 

Sehnsucht” in his West=Östlicher Divan, VIII. Buch: Suleika, in which stanza das \(‘ that’\) and dieses \(‘ this’\) co-occur and clearly refer – the first, implicitly; the second, explicitly – to one and the same arcane truth \(“Sagt es niemand, nur den Weisen, 

Weil die Menge gleich verhöhnet,” \[1ab\]\), the mysterious insight that ecstatic life lusts to die-in-flames \(“Das Lebend’ge will ich preisen, Das nach Flammentod sich sehnet.” \[1cd\]\). Now, that stanza runs like this:

Und solang Du das nicht hast, 

Dieses: Stirb und werde\! 

Bist Du nur ein trüber Gast

Auf der dunklen Erde. 

**4  The ETÁD–yád ****Construction in the Atharvaveda**

As pointed out above, the ETÁD– YÁD construction of R̥V and AV is very rare. Vedic Prose, on the other hand, is replete with sentences of the ETÁD– YÁD variety, of which two subtypes need to be distinguished. One preserves the kind of construction that we know already from R̥V and AV, in which ETÁD and YÁD refer to the same nucleus, agreeing with it in gender and number,106 unless YÁD takes the form of the neuter singular yád and works as conjunction.107

In the other subtype, ETÁD and YÁD are likewise co-referential, but now YÁD 

has altogether lost its variability. That inflexible neutral form, different in character from the conjunction yád, may be called yád figé.108

**106** The following are a few examples of the first subtype: KS 8.12: 95.16 ayajñó hí\_eṣá yó\_anagnír 

‘Without sacrifice is he who is without fire’, KS 11.8: 154.7–8 ná\_eṣá jīvó ná mr̥tó yá āmayāvī́ ‘Neither alive nor dead is he who is diseased’, KS 11.8: 154.8–9 váruṇagr̥hīta eṣá yá āmayāvī́ ‘Seized by Varuṇa is he who is diseased’, TS 6.4.9.1–2 ápūto hí\_eṣó\_amedhyó yó bhiṣák ‘For impure is he, unfit for sacrifice, who is a physician’. 

**107** This may be the case in R̥V 3.33.8ab etád váco . . . ā́ yát te ghóṣān . . . ; see above, example \[3\], where yád was taken as a conjunction of purpose in the sense of “en sorte que” by Renou and “so that” by J&B. Cf. also above, \(1\) the discussion on example \[7\] R̥V 7.56.4 etā́ni . . . niṇyā́ . . .  yád ū́dhas 

. . . , with footnote 48, and \(2\) the discussion on example \[9\] R̥V 10.10.2ab sakhiyám . . . etát . . . yád 

. . ., with footnote 58. 

**108**  ETÁD– yád  constructions of this second type are extremely well attested in Vedic Prose: In the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa alone, more than a hundred examples – 118, to be exact – are reported to 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[37]]

The first attestations of that yád, which I fancied styling figé, can be found in several prose passages of the Śaunaka-Saṁhitā; see below, samples \[1\]–\[6\] in 

section G. 

Surprisingly, that inflexible yád also occurs – although in the absence of an expected concomitant ETÁD – in a metrical text of the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā. 

\[19\] PS 6.9.1

vr̥ṣāyam aṁśur vr̥ṣabhāya gr̥hyate

vr̥ṣāyam ugro gr̥hyate nr̥cakṣase /

divyo naryo acikradan

mahan nāma r̥ṣabhasya yat kakut //

The Bull here, the \[soma plant’s\] stalk, \[its draught\] is drawn for the Bull \(Indra\). 

The Bull here, the awesome one, \[is drawn\] for the manly-eyed one.109

The heavenly one, the manly one has just uttered a roar. 

Great is the name of the Bull, namely HUNCH. 

In our yád figé context, we are mainly concerned with the last line of this stanza.110 

It was translated by Griffiths \(2009: 110\) in a way that seems to overly simplify the surprising construction for the sake of a straightforward meaning: “The withers of the bull are called Great.”111

occur; see Verpoorten 1977. And it is safe to say that the total number of ETÁD– yád occurrences in Vedic prose adds up to well over one thousand. 

**109** The incomplete parallelism of verses a  and b seems to call for metrical and syntactic completion. While a is a perfect Jagatī, b falls short of a dodecasyllabic verse by no fewer than three syllables; however, on account of its normal, pentasyllabic opening \( vr̥ṣāyam ugro\) and, more importantly, a very regular iambic cadence \( nr̥cakṣase\), b could still pass for a Jagatī, if only for a drastically catalectic one \(J9\). The addition of a subscript gr̥hyate in line b – at the place where the break should be – would restore both meter and syntax to normalcy. 

This is a well-known syntactic phenomenon, that in two parallel sentences, the finite verb appears only in the first, and is** ** elliptically** **left out in the second: verb** ** deletion** **as one kind of** ** gapping. 

For a different kind, see Selva \(2019: 87–88\), who suggests understanding the two-term enumeration at PS 17.13.5a** ** kimāsutāṃ** **✶ nagnahviyam** **in the sense of “The demoness who makes the liquor go bad, the one who is a \[bad\] ferment”, assuming a loss by** ** ellipsis** **of another** **✶ kim** **before the second word, in combination with which it would become, if it were restored, the first member of a new compound, ** **✶ kiṃnagnahvyam** **‘bad ferment’, parallel to** ** kimāsutām**. **

**110** Metrically speaking, pāda d may be defined as a typically catalectic Jagatī \(J11\), with 4\+7 \(instead of 4\+8 or 5\+7\) syllables. As Griffiths \(2009: 111\) has already pointed out, the cæsura \(after four syllables\) suggests that we follow the Kashmirian codex reading r̥ṣabhasya, and not the Orissan manuscripts, which read rṣabhasya. 

**111** If this is the meaning that was intended by the poet, why did he not simply say r̥ṣabhasya mahatīy ucyate kakut, for instance, and thus produce a very regular Jagatī into the bargain? Why would he take the trouble to introduce that mysterious yad figé, if it had no function of its own?.

Werner Knobl 

Ever since I first discussed, almost two decades ago, the pre-print edition of 

his Leiden proefschrift with Arlo Griffiths, it has unchangingly been my intui-

tive feeling – or shall I say, my hunch 112 – that mahan nāma r̥ṣabhasya yat kakut must have a different meaning, one that is closer to a very specific construction, known to us only from Vedic prose, but likely to have been more or less consciously present in the author’s mind. Or rather, a construction that may have preexisted 

in the spoken Vedic language, and which the author could have used – if he had wanted to sound prosaic or colloquial. 

The neuter pronoun yad, which proves to be figé because of its non-agreement with the feminine kakud-,113 should not be neglected. By virtue of that yad, the syntactically incomplete line has \[once for all\]  cried out \( acikradat\)114 – to the pointed ears of an acutely listening mind –, with the exacting intensity of a roaring bull, for syntactical completion. A second pronoun, even though it is obviously missing, seems to be implied and, without any difficulty, could be supplied, if only mentally: the there- deictic d-pronoun ETAD in one – or even two – of its several divergent functions.115

If we wished to reformulate this typically catalectic Jagatī \(J11\) – a verse defective by just one syllable – in the manner of a regular Brāhmaṇa-prose ETÁD– yád construction, we would have the choice between two slightly different types:

\[a\] mahad vai nāma\_etad r̥ṣabhasya yat kakut, 

\[b\] etad vai mahan nāma rṣabhasya yat kakut.116

**112** A hunch in the sense of ‘premonition’, and a premonition because I intuitively felt that this unique – unattracted – relative pronoun yad occurring in a metrical text of the Atharvaveda adum-brates, in the very absence of the expected correlative ETAD, the frequent ETÁD– yád construction of Vedic Prose. 

**113** With kakúd- f. ‘hump, hunch’ \(R̥V 1x, ŚS 6x\), cf. the synonymous and etymologically more genuine kakúbh- f. ‘id.’ \(R̥V 6x, ŚS 1x\); see Mayrhofer 1992–1996: 1.287 s.v. kakúbh- ‘Spitze, Gipfel’. 

**114** Originally, the present tense of the Vedic root krand/ krad ‘roar’ is attested in three forms: \[1\] 

as the thematic root-present kránd-a-ti \(R̥V 18x, ŚS 12x\), \[2\] as the intensive káni-krand-ti \(R̥V 37x, ŚS 1x\), and \[3\] as the later, secondary intensive kani-krad-yá-te \(e.g. ŚB 6.4.4.7 kanikradyámāna-\). In the R̥gveda, the “type IV” intensive \(for which see Schaefer 1994: 55ff. and 109–110\) proves more than twice as frequent as the class I present \(for which see Gotō 1987: 116\). For the two reduplicated aorist formations – ca-krad-a-t and ci-krad-a-t, different in form, but scarcely different in meaning, both being predominantly non-causative –, see Jamison 1983: 110–111. The very form ácikradat/

acikradat occurs \(5\+12=\)17 times in the R̥V, \(1\+1=\)2 times in the ŚS. 

**115** For the uniquely multifunctional nature of the there- deictic d-pronoun ETÁD, see above, the introductory part of this paper. 

**116** Examples for both of these perfectly possible formulations can be found by the hundreds in Vedic prose. For type \[a\], where the predicate of the main sentence is fronted, cf., e.g., MS 1.6.3: 89.8–9 asuryò vā́ etā́ yád óṣadhayaḥ ‘Dæmonesses are these – i.e. those Herbs.’ For type \[b\], cf., e.g., MS 1.6.6: 95.12 eṣá hí rudrá yád agníḥ ‘For this – namely that Agni – is Rudra.’ Of the two types, 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[39]]

**Excursus \(2\) on the Non-Attraction of yad**

We may wonder why, in sentences of this kind, the relative pronoun yad does not agree in gender and number with the noun or nouns to which it syntactically 

belongs. Why does it not change, in our specific case, to ✶ yā, since kakud- is feminine in gender? 

Curiously, it did change in the parallel mantra variant at TB 2.4.7.1, where we read br̥hán nā́ma / vr̥ṣabhásya yā́ kakút ‘high is the name \( this name, \[✶ etán\] 

nā́ma\) of the bull, \(namely that name, \[✶ etán\] nā́ma\), which is “hunch”.’117 And that change was brought about by grammatical attraction of the logical subject, an original ✶ yád – which anaphorically points back at the neuter nā́ma –, to the following feminine predicate kakúd-, resulting in the relative pronoun yā́. 

While wondering why the expected attraction of the pronoun yad to the noun kakud does not occur in the PS variant, we might remember similar cases of non-attraction: the famous Upaniṣadic formula tat tvam asi, for example, in ChU 6 \(occurring 9 times: at 6.8.7, 6.9.4, 6.10.3, 6.11.3, 6.12.3, 6.13.3, 6.14.3, 6.15.3, and 6.16.3\); or Pāṇini’s definition, for instance, of the neuter saṃpradāna-, the second kāraka- in a series of six or seven act-participants,118 at Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.4.32 karmaṇā yam abhi praiti sa saṃpradānam.119

As a first step towards the proper understanding of the surprising non-attrac-

tion in these as in some other cases, we would be justified in saying that the main condition for the pronoun’s attraction is not fulfilled: by rights, it should be subject, and the noun \(or nouns\) predicate. 

The absence of attraction indicates, on the other hand, that neither yad at PS 

6.9.1d yat kakut, nor tad at ChU 6.8.7–6.16.3 tat tvam asi, nor sa at Pāṇini, Aṣṭādhyāyī 

\[a\] may prove more frequent, but it is \[b\] that the twelve ETAD– yad constructions of PS 9.21.1–12 

exclusively follow; see the next section \(E.\). 

**117** Here, the split or double reference of ETÁD is only implicit; one and the same nā́ma  is tacitly referred to by the pronoun: once cataphorically with this \(\[✶ etád\]**1**\) and once anaphorically with that \(\[✶ etád\]**2**\). 

**118** Seven, if the hetu- m. ‘cause; causer’ \( causator\) or ‘causal agent’ – who is defined at Aṣṭādhyāyī 

1.4.55 tat-prayojako hetuś ca as the ‘instigator’ \( prayojaka-\) of ‘that’ \( tad-\), that is, of the otherwise 

‘independent’ \( svatantra-\) ‘agent’ \( kartar-\); cf. the definition of the agent as ‘the independent one’ 

at Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.4.54 svatantraḥ kartā – is counted in, not only as a second agent but as an agent of the second degree. 

**119** For a syntactical analysis of this sūtra, see Knobl forthc. 1; and for a critical discussion of the kāraka- section in Pāṇini’s grammar \(Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.4.23–55\) as an example of hierarchically ordered, climactic enumeration – ascending from the remotest act-participant, the so-called apādā-na- n. \(24\), to the kartar- m. \(54\) and the hetu- m. \(55\) at the top, the two kāraka- s that are closest to the verbal action itself: the central kriyā- f. reigning supreme –, see Knobl 2010. 

**40** 

Werner Knobl 

1.4.32 sa saṃpradānam could be subjects of their respective sentences, because, if they were, they would be attracted;120 which means, they must be predicates. 

Are we, however, justified in assuming that the ETÁD– yád construction, so distinctive a feature of Vedic prose, underlies already the metrical sentence found at PS 6.9.1d mahan nāma r̥ṣabhasya yat kakut ? And that the d-pronoun ✶ etad, which could be supplied quite naturally, was only left out for, say, metrical reasons?121

In other words: Did this construction already exist at the time of the PS? Not only did it exist at that time, it is also attested in the very text of the PS, and many times over, at that.122

**5  The ETÁD****– yád ****Constructions at PS 9.21.1–12**

A sequence of even twelve consecutive ETÁD– yád  constructions occurs at \[20\] PS 

9.21.1–12. The kind of correspondence, or relation of partial identity,123 that is repeatedly established there – between an ever-increasing number of sacrificial 

rice-dishes on the one hand, and certain apparently comparable entities of the 

same number on the other – may prove purely numerical.124

**120** Naturally, by such an \( hypothetical\) attraction, \[1\] PS yad would change to ✶ yā, \[2\] ChU tad to 

✶ sa, and \[3\] Aṣṭādhyāyī sa to ✶ tad, under the influence of \[1\] the feminine kakud-, \[2\] the implicit masculine gender of the personal pronoun  tvam – which is addressed to Śvetaketu Āruṇeya, son and disciple of Uddālaka Āruṇi –, and \[3\] the neuter saṃpradānam, respectively. 

**121** Actually, the addition of etad  would not only complete the syntax of an expected ETÁD– yád construction; it would also mend the meter \(which is, as it stands, defective by one syllable \[J11\]\) and restore it to a normal \(dodecasyllabic\) jagatī – with a cæsura after 5 syllables, an anapæst in the break, and a typically iambic cadence –, if we were to read ✶ mahan nāmaitad r̥ṣabhasya yat kakut.  In this supposedly complete version, the absence of the sentence particle** ** vái, which is regularly present in** ** ETÁD**–** yád  constructions, would, however, make for another, if only minor, kind of syntactical deficiency. 

**122** For the six examples of the ETAD– yad  construction in the Śaunaka-Saṁhitā – \[1\] ŚS 9.5.21, 

\[2\] ŚS 9.5.31b, \[3\] ŚS 9.6.23, \[4\] ŚS 9.6.37, \[5\] ŚS 11.3.50, and \[6\] ŚS 18.1.14cd –, see below, section G. 

**123** For this correspondence or relation of partial  identity, see below, footnote 140, where the 

“identification” that is allegedly at work between the subject ETÁD and the predicate \(“S=P”\) in the main sentence of an ETÁD– yád  construction comes under critical scrutiny. 

**124** It could appear futile to search for a deeper significance of this numeric relation, although certain scholars may claim that there is something magical, or even mystical, about it; as if we had to do with cabalistic numbers\!. 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[41]]

In the following, I will discuss only two of those twelve ETÁD– yád  constructions – namely the third and the fifth125 – and oppose, where it seems necessary, my interpretation to that of Kim 2014.126

After the first two ETÁD– yád constructions in their respective sections, eṣa vā 

ekarṣir yad agniḥ \[1\], etau vai prāṇāpānau yan mātariśvā cāgniś ca \[2\], the next runs like this: etāni vai trīṇi trikadrukāṇi yad r̥caḥ sāmāni yajūṁṣi brāhmaṇam \[3\]. 

In one of my Kyōto papers \(Knobl 2009a\), I wrote the following comment on the 

third ETÁD– yád construction: “Although three trikadrukas are mentioned, together with a cake offered on three plates,127 we find a full set of no fewer than four Vedic text categories, or literary genres, being enumerated in the final phrase: \[1\] the stanzas of the Ṛgveda \( ŕ̥cas\), \[2\] the songs of the Sāmaveda \( sā́māni\), \[3\] the sacrificial formulæ \( yájūṁṣi\) of the Yajurveda, and – surprisingly – also \[4\] the magic spell \( brā́hmaṇam\) of the brahmáṇ-, the poet-priest and magician of the Fourth Veda\! 

Being a Paippalādin, the author of this passage can be excused for thinking 

of his own brand of knowledge, and for feeling, with a fine sense of loyalty to his ancestors, that the Atharvavedic bráhmaṇ- n. ‘incantation’128 should not be left out in the cold. Eager to do justice to the very specific contribution to Vedic literature by his own school of thought, he makes bold to add a fourth member to the already complete set of three, blissfully oblivious of the numerical logic of his text.” 

Here, Kim has offered a different solution to the problem. He takes the fourth 

term, the neuter singular brā́hmaṇam – understood in the sense of ‘that which **125** See Knobl 2009a, where also a few other ETAD– yad  constructions of this duodecimal sequence – especially the seventh, ninth, tenth, and twelfth – are discussed at some length. 

**126** Kim’s translations of the twelve ETAD– yad  constructions in PS 9.21.1–12 all follow the same pattern. As a typical example may serve the very first construction, eṣa vā ekarṣir yad agniḥ, which he renders “Dieser, fürwahr, einzige R̥ṣi \[ist\] nämlich Agni” \(Kim 2014: 372\). According to what is developed in other parts of the present paper, concerning the split or double reference of ETÁD, I would suggest the following alternative: ‘ This – namely that Agni – “is” the one-and-only R̥ṣi.’ For the two-directional deixis, see, especially, sections C. and G. 

The compound** ** ekarṣí-**/** ekar̥ṣí- occurs three times in the ŚS \(at 8.9.25 and 26; and at 10.7.14\), but Agni is not intended in any of these three text-places. 

**127** This wording has to be corrected in the light of Kim’s clarification, to the effect that the offering in section 3, a tri-śarāva- \[ odana-\] means a rice-dish measuring three śarāva. For śárāva- m./n. 

‘plate’ and ‘measure’ \(TS, TB, ŚB, etc.\), see B&R 7.96–97: \(1\) ‘flache Schüssel, Teller’ and \(2\) ‘Maß für Korn’. 

**128** The proparoxytone neuter brā́hmaṇa- \(R̥V 2x, ŚS 13x\), which is likely to be derived from the masculine brahmáṇ-, has nearly the same meaning as the neuter bráhmaṇ- ‘poetic formulation, magic spell’, from which brahmáṇ- is \(internally\) derived in its turn. See the simultaneous occurrence of the two neuters, especially at ŚS 11.5.5c \(≈ PS 16.153.4c\) tásmāj jātáṃ brā́hmaṇaṃ bráhma jyeṣṭhám ‘From him \(= the brahmacārín- ‘Vedic student’\) was born the brā́hmaṇa- \[n.\], \(which is\) the oldest bráhmaṇ- \[n.\].’

**42** 

Werner Knobl 

belongs to the bráhmaṇ- n.’– as a kind of common denominator covering the three text categories enumerated before.129

In section 5, on the other hand, where a rice-dish measuring five plates is prescribed as a direct object of oblation, and a five- headed \( pañca-mūrdhan-\) Vaiśvānara is mysteriously referred to,130 the enumeration of a corresponding number 

of elements in the final yad- phrase seems to be defective. For, according to a first, superficial count, Heaven and Earth, Mātariśvan and Agni, do not amount to more 

than a square four. 

This is Kim’s \(emended \[✶\]\) edition and translation of PS 9.21.5:

yo vai pañcaśarāvaṃ nirvaped

vaiśvānaram eva pañcamūrdhānam anu nir vapet /

eṣa vai vaiśvānaraḥ pañcamūrdhā

yad dyauś ca pr̥thivī ca mātariśvā ca\_agniś ca\_

✶ ajasrā \[sic\] ✶ ca\_ātapan / . . . \[5\]

Wer fürwahr den fünf Śarāva messenden \[Reisbrei\] austeilen sollte,131

der soll \[ihn\] nur gemäß dem fünfköpfigen Vaiśvānara austeilen. 

Dieser, fürwahr, \[fünfköpfige\]132 Vaiśvānara \[ist\] nämlich

Himmel, Erde, Mātariśvan, Agni und \[Sūrya\], 

der durch Glut die unvergänglichen \[Lichter\] ausstrahlt. \(Kim 2014: 378\)

**129** Cf. his translation: “Diese, fürwahr, drei Trikadruka-Gefäße \[sind\] nämlich das, was zum Bráhman gehört: die R̥g-Verse, die Sāman-Melodien \[und\] die Yajus-Sprüche.” \(Kim 2014: 375\). For the unjustified – and unjustifiable – inversion of subject and predicate in this as in many other so-called identifications, see below, footnotes 140, 160, and 162: in footnote 160, I express my criticism of Whitney’s conflicting note on his own translation of ŚS 9.6.37, which renders the literal meaning of the original quite adequately; in footnote 162, I take exception to Renou’s rendering of the same prose passage, eṣá vā́ átithir yác chrótriyas \(“l’hôte \[n’est autre qu’\] un spécialiste de la śruti”\), a sentence that should be understood in the exact reverse sense; namely, in the sense of a regular P–S 

construction \(with fronted predicate\): ‘le spécialiste de la śruti “\(n’est autre qu’\)” un hôte.’ 

**130** The bahuvrīhi- compound pañca-mūrdhan- does not seem to be attested anywhere else in Vedic. Closest in meaning to it is pañca-mukha-, which compound occurs at Kauṣītaki-Upaniṣad 2.9 somo rājā\_asi vicakṣaṇaḥ pañcamukho\_asi prajāpatiḥ ‘\[O Full Moon\] You are wide-visioned King Soma. You are five-mouthed Prajāpati.’ The adjective vi-cakṣaṇá- ‘wide-visioned’ \(R̥V 31x\) is, from the oldest texts onward, a characteristic epithet of King Soma; it typically occurs in the Ninth Song-Cycle of the R̥gveda \(18x against 13x in other Books, 1: 4x, 2: 1x, 3: 1x, 4: 3x, 8: 1x, and 10: 3x\). 

**131** The optative nirvapet  of the subordinate clause may have come about by mere mood attraction to the prescriptive optative nir vapet in the main sentence; it could simply have the meaning of an indicative: ‘austeilt’ instead of “austeilen sollte” \(Kim\). However, the subordinate optative nirvapet could also be taken as a potential mood, in which case “sollte” \(‘should’\) would be justified as expressive of possibility. 

**132** The adjective pañcamūrdhan- qualifying vaiśvānara- as ‘five-headed’ has remained untranslated. 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[43]]

Kim, who could not make head or tail of the two – practically identical – manu-

script readings cādaśāvātapan \(JM etc.\) / cādasāvātapan \(RM\), emends a perfectly readable sequence of syllables to ✶ cājasrā ✶ cātapan, and argues at some length – 

and quite unconvincingly – in favor of this audacious but altogether superfluous 

emendation. His argument runs as follows: “Da hier ein fünftes Wort sinngemäß 

\(Himmel, Erde, Mātariśvan, Agni sind vier\) zu erwarten ist, ist eine Emendation 

mit ca- notwendig. Demnach ist zuerst zu cādasā ✶ cātapan \( ca-ātapan\) zu segmen-tieren; . . . Dem ersten Glied cādaśā bzw. cādasā in Or . . . liegt sicher eine Korrup-tion zugrunde.” \(Kim 2014: 379\)133

To be sure, in this set of supposedly five cosmic or mythological realities, we 

need a fifth member after the first four. These four realities form two natural pairs typically belonging together: ‘Heaven-and-Earth’ and ‘Mātariśvan-and-Agni’.134 

Each of the two pairs is coupled by two times ca.135 A fifth ca seems to be missing. 

However, ca is not the only possible connective particle; it could be u or uta, or atha or atho \(=  atha \_ u\), or – āt. In fact, āt may prove the very particle136 that was expected as a necessary complement. And, lo and behold, it is actually there – if we read the well-attested sequence of syllables, i.e. cādasāvātapan, in four distinct words, as ca\_ād asāv ātapan.137

**133** The only corruption that I am able to detect is the “emendation” itself. Far from being an improvement on the text, this daring conjecture, which produces – quite unnecessarily – several new problems, results in what may be called a Verschlimmbesserung. 

**134** The close \(mythological\) connection between Agni and Mātariśvan – apart from the fact that A. was stolen by M. – is illustrated at R̥V 1.71.4a máthīd yád īṃ víbhr̥to mātaríśvā \(“Als der verteilte Mātariśvan ihn \[den Agni\] raubte” \[Knobl 2022: 153\]\) by the rhetorical transfer of the verbal adjective ví-bhr̥ta- from Agni to Mātariśvan. As a matter of fact, only Fire is distributed. 

For the translation and discussion of** ** one** **adjectival and** ** three** **pronominal examples of** ** hypal-lage**, **see Knobl 2022: 150–154 \[Section C. with “Exkurs 9”\]. 

**135** In section 8, even four pairs are enumerated, and each pair is again coupled by two times ca, to wit, \[1\] Heaven-and-Earth \( dyauś ca pr̥thivī ca\), \[2\] Water-and-Herbs \( āpaś ca\_oṣadhayaś ca\), \[3\] 

Wind-and-Space \( vāyuś ca\_antarikṣaṃ ca\), \[4\] Sun-and-Moon \( sūryaś ca candramāś ca\). 

It is safe to say that** ** coupling  words expressive of** ** natural** **– and often naturally opposed –** ** pairs** **

**is **the proper and most characteristic function of the** ** copulative** **particle** ** ca, even if enumeration of several members that are not pairs by means of** ** ca** **should prove more frequent; this might most easily happen in texts where enumeration runs wild, without any consideration for conceptual dualities. 

**136** Originally, ā́t is the adverbialized ablative singular of the there- deictic d-pronoun á-, as in á-tra 

‘there’ \(R̥V 120x\) or  á-tas ‘from there’ \(R̥V 61x\), etc. Literally, ā́t may mean \[1\] ‘ from that’ \(spatial\); 

\[2\] ‘ after that’ \(temporal\); \[3\] ‘ because of that’ \(causal\), respectively. 

**137** For ā́t after one \(A B ca –\) or two \(A ca B ca –\) syndetic ca  particles, or after an equivalent asyn-deton \(A B –\), cf. R̥V 7.66.11ab ví yé dadhúḥ śarádam mā́sam ā́d áhar yajñám aktúṃ ca\_ā́d ŕ̥cam, R̥V

As my translation of the fifth ETAD– yad construction in PS 9.21.5, re-edited as eṣa vai vaiśvānaraḥ pañcamūrdhā

yad dyauś ca pr̥thivī ca mātariśvā ca\_agniś ca\_\_ād asāv ātapan, 

I would, therefore, suggest the following:

‘ These – namely those \[five realities:\] Heaven-and-Earth, Mātariśvan-and-Agni, and \(‘after that’\) the one burning \[at . . . \] \( ā-tap\)138 up there \(= Sūrya\)139 –

“are” \[= represent / correspond to\] the five-headed Vaiśvānara.’

jánya ā́d agnís, ŚS 4.3.3a–c akṣyàu ca te múkhaṃ ca te **\+** víyāghra jambhayāmasi /  ā́t sárvān viṁśatíṃ 

nakhā́n, ŚS 4.9.8b takmā́ balā́sa ā́d áhiḥ, ŚS 4.20.1c \(≈ PS 8.6.1c\) dívam \(PS dyām\) antárikṣam ā́d bhū́mim, ŚS 7.70.2a yātudhā́nā nírr̥tir ā́d u rákṣas, ŚS 11.9.8c pátiṃ bhrā́taram ā́t suvā́n, ŚS 13.2.41c \(≈ PS 18.24.10c\) dívaṁ samudrám ā́d bhū́mim, PS 16.104.9d gāvo aśvāḥ puruṣā ād ajāvayaḥ, etc. etc. 

Notice, most especially, ā́t immediately following ca at R̥V 7.66.11b yajñám aktúṃ ca\_ā́d ŕ̥cam. This sequence \(. . . ca\_ā́d . . .\) is exactly the same as at PS 9.21.5 mātariśvā ca\_agniś ca\_ād asāv ātapan. 

It seems typical for** ** ā́t  to stand in third or fifth position of an enumeration, after two or four terms that are paired – either syndetically \(with** ** ca\) or asyndetically \(without** ** ca\) – into one or two couples that are closely related, such as Heaven-and-Earth or Sun-and-Moon. 

**138** By virtue of the directive ā́, the verbal compound ā́-tap should regularly be construed with an accusative of the direct object. To be sure, the \(seemingly\) intransitive – or rather, elliptical – 

construction of ā́-tap is well attested; see, for instance, ŚS 8.6.12ab \(≈ PS 16.80.3ab\) yé sū́ryaṃ ná títikṣanta ātápantam amúm diváḥ ‘\[They \(= the mákaka- dæmons\),\] who cannot endure the Sun up there burning \(down\) \[ at them\] from heaven’, ŚS 12.1.20a \(≈ PS 17.3.1a\) agnír divá ā́ tapatiy ‘Agni \[as Sun the celestial Fire\] burns \(down\) from heaven \[ at the earth\]’, ŚS 12.3.50c \(≈ PS 17.54.10c\) yā́vanto devā́ divíy ātápanti ‘as many gods as burn in heaven \[ at . . . ?\]’, PS 5.6.2a ātapan kṣayati ✶ nīcā ‘He \(the Sun\) rules, burning downward \(from heaven\) \[ at the earth\]’. 

Kim \(2014: 379\) advocates a different understanding; he thinks that the intransitive construction of** ** ā́-tap** **is original, and that the accusative, if it does co-occur, as** ** ghr̥tam** **at PS 5.6.1c=10c** **

te\_asmai sarve ghr̥tam** ** ā tapantiy** **“they all heat \(the\) ghee for him \(the patron\)” \(Lubotsky 2002: 37 

and 43\), is a “Richtungsakkusativ” and as such would not transitivize the verb. But what difference is there between ‘to direct heat at’ and ‘to heat directly’, if the heating action affects the object with equal intensity? After all, Sun is the agent\!. 

**139** The far- deictic d-pronoun ADÁS \(R̥V 52x\) meaning ‘the one over there’ can also be taken in the sense of \[1\] ‘the one up there’ \( là-haut\) or \[2\] ‘the one down there’ \( là-bas\). To the Sun rising or risen, we may refer with the first; to the Sun sinking or sunk, with the second. 

For asáu** **m./f. \(R̥V 7x\) pointing at the Sun up there, see, for instance, R̥V 1.191.9a úd apaptat asáu sū́ryaḥ or 10.159.1a úd asáu sū́riyo agād. These two verses indicate the Sun \( up there\) as having just risen \(from behind the horizon\); the first \(or root\) aorist agād and the third \(or reduplicated\) aorist apaptat both refer to an event of the recent past, making a definite statement about it. 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[45]]

**6  Earlier Attempts at Understanding the ETÁD-yád**** **

**Construction**

In the history of Vedic scholarship, those who translated – or commented 

upon – examples of the ETÁD– yád construction came more or less close to a proper understanding of the yád figé, provided they accepted its existence and unique character at all. 

\[1\] Of ETÁD– yád constructions without verb, Delbrück \(1888: 566\) says: “Das Ganze hat den Sinn einer Identificirung,140 wobei das bei yád stehende Sub-stantivum die Anknüpfung bietet und hervorgehoben wird . . . Als Muster-

beispiel mag dienen: \[AB 1.3.10\] . . . yonir vā eṣā dīkṣitasya yad dīkṣitanimitam . . .141 Das ist der Schooss des Geweihten, was die Hütte des Geweihten ist 

. . .142 Die Belege für diesen Typus sind zahllos, z. B.: \[AB 1.8.5\] paśavo vā ete yad āpaḥ Wasser ist dem Vieh gleich zu achten . . . ”143 \[MS 1.4.10: 58.1\] devátānāṃ 

vā́ etád āyátanaṃ yád ā́havanīyaḥ der āhavanīya ist der Stützpunkt der Götter.”144 Then, while mentioning also two ETÁD– yád constructions with verb,145 

Delbrück \(1888: 567\) concludes: “Endlich kann yád so sehr den Charakter einer **140** “Identification” is certainly not the mot juste. The unspoken copula joining subject and predicate – rather than silently meaning “is” or “are” – has the less equalizing sense of ‘represent\(s\)’, 

‘correspond\(s\) to’, ‘can be compared with’. No identity in the full sense of the word is meant, none that would go beyond a certain resemblance; and even a minimal similitude may be reason enough to relate the two sentence parts: the pronominal subject ETÁD, which is defined by the yád- phrase, on the one hand, and the predicative noun\(s\) on the other. Their relation of a no-more-than-just-partial  identity is like that of the two parts in a nominal phrase. 

Only if we could start from the assumption that in predication subject \(S\) and predicate \(P\) are identified** –** which, in fact, they never are; rather, their relation follows the abstract formula S≠P –, would the word order be indifferent; ** **✶S=P would then, and only then, be equal to ✶P=S. But this is far from** **being the case. 

**141** Here, dīkṣitanimitam happens to be of the same gender and number as yad, but this is a mere coincidence; the accidental equality does not mean that the pronoun is attracted to the noun. The subsequent two examples \(AB 1.8.5 paśavo vā ete yad āpaḥ and MS 1.4.10: 58.1  devátānāṃ vā́ etád āyátanaṃ yád āhavanīyaḥ\) make it clear that also in Delbrück’s “Musterbeispiel” AB 1.3.10, none other than the yad figé is concerned. 

**142** According to my understanding, it would be closer to the syntax of this construction, and the twofold reference of ETÁD would be taken into due account, if the sentence were translated as follows: ‘ This – namely that hut of the dīkṣita – “is” the womb of the dīkṣita.’

**143** Here, my own translation would run like this: ‘ These – namely those waters  – “are” cattle.’

**144** Again, I would prefer a different version: ‘ This – namely that āhavanīya- fire  – “is” the gods’ 

foothold.’

**145** The finite verbs in Delbrück’s two examples – dadr̥śur at ŚB 1.1.1.17 and bhavati at ŚS 

3.3.4.20 – accompany ETÁD in the main sentence .  If it were the subordinate clause that contains 

**46** 

Werner Knobl 

flectirten Relativform einbüssen, dass es lediglich als Anfügungswort innerh-

alb des Satzes wirkt \(etwa durch nämlich zu übersetzen\) . . . z. B.: \[ŚB 1.1.1.17\] 

táto devā́ etáṃ vájraṃ dadr̥śur yád apáḥ  da erfanden die Götter jenen vajra, nämlich das Wasser . . .146 \[ŚB 3.3.4.20\] átra\_ubháyair ártho bhavati yád deváiś ca brāhmaṇáiś ca  der beiden bedarf man dabei, nämlich der Götter und der Brahmanen . . . \[ŚB 1.2.1.22\] mahyà íti ha vā́ etā́sām ékaṃ nā́ma yád gávām “die grossen”, das ist ein Name derselben, nämlich der Kühe.”147

\[2\] The following observation made by Renou \(1955 \[=  EVP I\]: 85 §13b\) is, no doubt, important: “Le tour eṣá vā́ áparimito yajñó yád ajá páñcaudanaḥ \[ŚS 9.5.21\] 

« Le bouc \(offert\) sur cinq portions de riz \(représente un type de\) sacrifice illimité » \(analogue ibid., 31–36 \[et ŚS 9.6.23\]\) est l’une des phraséologies de prédi-lection des Br\[āhmaṇas\], avec rejet du sujet encadré par la conjonction yád.”148





Renou goes on to say \(ibid.\): “On en chercherait en vain des traces dans les 

mantra.” If I am right in taking the unattracted yad at PS 6.9.1d mahan nāma r̥ṣabhasya yat kakut as at least une trace of the ETÁD– yád construction in a Vedic metrical text, then my research was not en vain. 





In what follows next \(ibid.\), Renou seems to have missed something, when 

he states: “En revanche, le pronom relatif dans le même encadrement, type eṣá vā́ átithir yá chrótriyaḥ \[ŚS 9.6.37\] ‘l’hôte \(n’est autre qu’\) un spécialiste de la śruti’,149 commence à paraître dans le RV. et se développe dans l’AV. poétique : seul la corrélation eṣá\(ḥ\) . . . yáḥ souligne qu’on a décidément affaire à de la prose.” 



Since ŚS 9.6.37 is a typical example of the ETÁD– yád construction, yá chrótriyaḥ \(i.e. yác chrótriyaḥ\) being the sandhi- result of yát\_śrótriyaḥ,150 we cannot say that this relative pronoun – viz. the yád figé – begins to appear in the verb, as in almost all twelve examples of the ETÁD– YÁD  construction quoted in section A., we would have no reason whatsoever to speak of an ETÁD– yád construction. 

**146** Or rather: ‘Then the gods “saw” these – namely those waters – as a vájra.’ \( dadr̥śur ‘sie er-schauten’\!\). 

**147** This is my alternative: ‘“Great” \( mahī́- f.\) is \[just\] one name of these – namely of those cows.’

**148** The yád figé in the ETÁD– yád construction happens to have the same form as “la conjonction yád”, but this does not mean that the yád  actually is a conjunction; we should prefer to consider it a relative pronoun. 

**149** For my translation of this sentence, ‘ This – i.e. that “hearer” of the śrúti- \( śrótriya-\) – “is” a guest’, see below, in the semi-final section \(G.\) of the present paper. And for the non-identifying 

“is”, see above, footnote 140. 

**150** For the external sandhi- combination of the two consonants \[t\] and \[ś\], in which the dental is assimilated to the palatal \(“assibilation”\), and the sibilant is subsequently converted to ch; but, especially, for the scribal spelling convention 〈cch〉 → 〈ch〉, see Whitney 1889: 68 §203: “The manuscripts generally write **ch**, instead of **cch**, as result of the combination of **t** and **ç **\(= \[ś\]\).” 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[47]]

the R̥V. What we meet with in the oldest text is only the ETÁD– YÁD construction, where the YÁD regularly varies in accord with the gender and number of ETÁD by what is called grammatical agreement.151 If I were to improve on Renou, I would, therefore, venture to reformulate his last statement, changing 

it but minimally into: ‘seul la corrélation ETÁD . . . yád \[\!\] souligne qu’on a décidément affaire à de la prose.’

\[3\] Hettrich \(1988: 570\) enumerates the following R̥gvedic stanzas or distichs 

as restrictive relative constructions with the d-pronoun eṣá-/ etá- \[= ETÁD\] 

as correlative: 1.182.5, 8.1.32, 10.10.8\[ab\], 10.28.12ab, 10.48.6, 10.50.6\[ab\], 

10.71.9, 10.165.4. And he concludes: “Bis auf eine Stelle \[7.7.6\]152 kommt also 

eṣá-/ etá- als Korrelativum restriktiver RKK \[= Relativ-Konstruktionen\] nur in jüngeren Partien des RV vor. Dies deutet darauf hin, daß das Pronomen diese 

Funktion erst sekundär übernommen hat.” 





If I understand the author correctly, this would mean that in older parts 

of the R̥gveda, the d-pronoun ETÁD has preserved its primary function as a correlative of non-restrictive – that is, descriptive or appositive – relative constructions. Although I disagree with regard to 1.182.5, 10.10.8, 10.50.6, 10.71.9, and 10.165.4 \(?\), which for me are more or less clear examples of a non-restrictive relative construction,153 the descriptive function of YÁD in the ETÁD– YÁD 

constructions of the R̥V is certainly more original. 

\[4\] Two younger scholars – both authors of commented editions and translations 

of important Vedic texts \(MS and PS\) – have also remarked on the constructions 

discussed above. Kyōko Amano \(2009: 106–111 § 2.4.5\), speaking of the pro-

nominal sequence “eṣá-/ etá- . . . yá-”, states: “Bei der Relativkonstruktion mit vorangehendem eṣá-/ etá- liegt das demonstrativ-anamnestische Pronomen in scheinbar kataphorischer Verwendung vor.” The several MS examples quoted 

and translated by Amano make it abundantly clear that the ETÁD– yád construction and the yád figé are concerned. However, in the yád- figé constructions, the d-pronoun ETÁD is not only anaphoric \(“anamnestisch”\), but also cataphoric – und zwar wirklich, not just seemingly \(“scheinbar”\). 

**151** See the twelve examples of this extremely rare construction discussed above, in the first section \(A.\) of the present paper: \[1\] eténa . . . yád . . ., \[2\] etám . . . yéna . . ., \[3\] etád . . . yád . . ., \[4\] eṣás . . . yám 

. . ., \[5\] etám . . . yásya . . . yás . . ., \[6\] eté . . . yé . . . yé . . . yé . . ., \[8\] eṣá . . . yás . . ., \[9\] etád . . . yád . . ., 

\[10\] eté . . . yé . . ., \[11\] eṣá . . . yás . . ., \[12\] etā́ . . . yā́ni . . .; only in \[7\] etā́ni . . . yád . . ., the two pronouns do not agree in number. 

**152** Cf. Hettrich 1988: 570 Anm. 145: “7,7,6; die Korrelativfunktion ist aber nicht eindeutig; in 4,35,4 

ist der RS \[= Relativ-Satz\] nicht eindeutig als restriktiv oder appositiv bestimmbar.” 

**153** See above, in the first section of this paper, my discussion of examples \[2\], \[10\], \[12\], \[13\], and \[14\]. 

**48** 

Werner Knobl 





Umberto Selva, on the other hand, opts for the opposite view. He empha-

sizes the cataphoric function \(or this- reference\) of the d-pronoun ETÁD in the ETÁD– yád construction: “it \[that is, the ETÁD\] refers forward to the content of the yád phrase.” And he adds: “In translating, I generally follow the following “formula” \(which I owe to the teaching of Werner Knobl\): \[ eṣá- \( vái\) A, yád B\] “This \( eṣá-\), namely \( yád\) B, is A” \(Selva 2019: 224\).154 However, in Selva’s \(one-sided\) presentation of the ETÁD– yád construction, the anaphoric function \(or that- reference\) of ETÁD is sorely lacking. 



Only if we combine the two partial views – this advocated by Selva 

and that vindicated by Amano155 –, will it be possible for us to see the whole picture in its ambiguous but complementary beauty. 

**7  The Semi-Final Part**

In this last-but-one section of the present paper, I am going to confront my own 

translations of half a dozen ŚS passages – five are composed in prose \(examples 

\[1\]–\[5\]\), one in the triṣṭubh meter \(example \[6\]\) – with those of Whitney \(W&L\) or Renou. These six AV sentences hark back to section C., where the split or double reference of ETÁD was introduced with two R̥V distichs and their AV parallels \(examples \[16\] and \[17\]\), and one AV stanza, half of which corresponds to yet another R̥V distich \(example \[18\]\). 

Here \(in G.\), as well as there \(in C.\), one and the same multi-functional d-pro-

noun ETÁD points in two different directions: \[1\] at something that follows in the yád- phrase \(cataphoric ‘ this’\) and, simultaneously, \[2\] at something that precedes **154** Having become, malgré moi, the source of a misunderstanding, I regret that my teaching, at Leiden and in other academic places, had – a few years ago – not yet acquired the clarity that is needed in order to understand and to make understand the complexity of the ETÁD– yád  construction with proper precision and accuracy. If now I were to formulate a “formula”, it would have to be something like: “This \(S1 = cataphoric ETÁD \[→\] or \[↓\]\) – namely \( yád\) that \(S2 = anaphoric ETÁD 

\[←\] or \[↑\]\) – corresponds to P.” \(Here, both S1 \[ this\] and S2 \[ that\] stand for one and the same thing; they are the one subject of the same predication.\)

**155** Amano herself uses the here- deictic this \(“das” or “dieses”\) in her translations of ETÁD, which she calls “demonstrativ-anamnestisches Pronomen” \(see above\), but I feel free to change her here- deictic this into my own there- deictic that, because ETÁD ‘ that . . . there’ may point, in one of its multiple functions, at the same \( mid-distance\) target as Amano’s this referring to something 

‘well-known’ \( prá-siddha-\) or ‘mentally present’ \(✶ buddhi-ṣṭhá-\), to something that is ‘das Bekannte, Bewusste, Betreffende’ for her; for others, this is the so-called topical  reference of ETÁD. 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic 

[[49]]

in the context \(anaphoric ‘ that’\).156 This two-directional function of ETÁD helps to understand the specific character of the ETÁD– yád  construction in the following six ŚS passages – two of which \(\[1\] and \[6\]\) have parallels in the PS – and in any other context where the yád figé should make its appearance. 

\[1\] ŚS 9.5.21 \(≈ PS 16.99.8\)

eṣá vā́ áparimito yajñó yád ajá páñcaudanaḥ //

“this verily is an unlimited offering, 

namely \( yát\) the goat with five rice-dishes.” \(W&L\)

“Le bouc \(offert\) sur cinq portions de riz

\(représente un type de\) sacrifice illimité.” \(Renou 1955: 85 §13b\)

‘ This – namely that five-rice-dish \( páñcaudana-\) goat –

represents an unlimited sacrifice.’

\[2\] ŚS 9.5.31b

eṣá vái náidāgho nā́ma rtúr yád ajáḥ páñcaudanaḥ /

“that verily is the season ‘torrid’ by name, 

namely \( yát\) the goat with five rice-dishes.” \(W&L\)

‘ This – namely that five-rice-dish \( páñcaudana-\) goat –

corresponds to the season called “hot” \( náidāgha-\) \(=summer\).’157

\[3\] ŚS 9.6.23

eté vái priyā́ś ca\_ápriyāś ca rtvíjaḥ

svargáṃ lokáṃ gamayanti yád átithayaḥ //

“These same guests, both loved \( priyá\) and unloved, 

\[as\] priests \( ṛtvíj\), make \[one\] go to the heavenly world.” \(W&L\)

‘ These – i.e. those  guests –, \[as\] priests that are liked \( priyá-\) or disliked \( á-priya-\),158

make \[us\] go to the heavenly world.’

\[4\] ŚS 9.6.37

eṣá vā́ átithir yác chrótriyas

tásmāt pū́rvo ná\_aśnīyāt //

“He verily is a guest, namely \( yát\) one versed in sacred learning \( çrótriya\); **156** For a more detailed exposition of this d-pronoun’s two-directional deixis, see above, section C., and below, footnote 164. 

**157** Ved. náidāgha- ‘hot; æstival’ \(ŚS 2x\) is derived from Ved. nidāghá- m. ‘heat; summer’ \(JB, ŚB, KātyŚS, KauśS\). This is yet another example of a derivative being attested earlier than the word it is based upon. 

**158** The two antonymic adjectives priyá- and á-priya- qualifying the priests as either ‘dear’ or ‘not dear’ \[to us, that is,\] are used predicatively. They indicate an alternative \(“liked . . . or disliked . . .”, meaning ‘whether they are liked or not \[doesn’t really matter\]’\); the two qualities cannot simultaneously apply to the priests \(cf. “both loved . . . and unloved” \[W&L\]\), unless in a distributive sense \( vīpsāyām\): to some they may be priyá-, to some others á-priya-; or to the same person\(s\) alternately 

‘dear’ and ‘not dear’, but at different times and in different situations.

Werner Knobl 

before him one should not partake.” \(W&L\)159

“l’hôte \(n’est autre qu’\) un spécialiste de la śruti.” \(Renou 1955: 85 §13b160

‘ This – i.e. that “hearer” of the śrúti- \( śrótriya-\)161 – “is” a guest.162

Therefore, one should not eat before him \(= before that “hearer” \[who “is” a guest\]\).’163

\[5\] ŚS 11.3.50

etád vái bradhnásya viṣṭápaṃ yád odanáḥ /

“This – namely, the rice-dish –164

**159** “The meaning intended ought to be that a guest is the equivalent of such a sage; but the literal meaning is as translated” \(W&L\). I do not agree; if tásmāt means ‘therefore’ as well as ‘\[earlier\] 

than him’ – for which see below, footnote 163 –, then the logical consequence introduced by tásmāt depends on the fact that the śrótriya- “is the equivalent” of a guest – not vice versa –, and that therefore one has to treat him as such, by granting him precedence at the table; because an invited guest enjoying the hospitality of a host is allowed to eat first, the śrótriya- only by equivalence with him. 

For several passages in the Atharvaveda alluding to the same privilege a guest must be allowed to enjoy in his host’s house, at ŚS 9.6.32,33,38 and PS 16.113.10,12, cf. Spiers 2020: 403. 

**160** Syntactically, this translation is inadequate. The śrótriya- being subject, « un spécialiste de la śruti » should have come first in Renou’s translation. 

**161** The -ya- or -iya-  adjective śrótriya- \(ŚS 3x: 9.6.37, 10.2.20, 10.2.21\) is derived from śrótra- n. ‘ear, hearing’ \(R̥V 2x: 10.85.11c śrótraṃ te cakré āstām, 10.90.14c padbhyā́m bhū́mir díśaḥ śrótrāt; ŚS 

23x\). The noun śrúti- f. \(ŚS 1x: 11.7.20\), which is based on the same root śrav/ śru ‘to hear, to listen to’, indicates, by its retracted accent, that the meaning has changed from that of a nomen actionis \(✶ śrutí-  f. ‘the abstract act of hearing’\) to that of a nomen rei actae. Thus, śrúti- refers to the concrete result of hearing, which is the oral and auricular tradition as laid down in Sacred Lore \(or, Holy 

“Writ”\). 

**162** The silent copula “is” may be understood in the sense of ‘means’, ‘stands for’, ‘represents’, ‘typ-ifies’, ‘symbolizes’, ‘corresponds to’, ‘is comparable to’, or the like. Even the make-shift expression 

“is the equivalent of” \(W&L\) does not amount to ‘is identical with’ or ‘is none other than’ \(“n’est autre que” \[Renou\]\). If “is” were to be used at all costs, then a non- equalizing “is in a sense” would at least help to avoid any \(false, complete\) identification in the strict sense of the word. 

On the relation of partial** **identity or, abstractly speaking, ** ** non- identity \(S≠P\) between the subject** ** ETÁD** **and its predicate, see above, footnote 140. 

**163** In this ambiguous sentence, tásmāt can be taken both \[1\] as a consecutive adverb meaning 

‘therefore’ and \[2\] as an ablative construed with the adjective pū́rvas ‘former’ functioning as a quasi- preposition in the sense of ‘before, earlier than’. 

**164** Among all the translations that I have consulted, this formulation comes closest to my own idea of how the ETÁD–yád construction of Vedic prose works, and how it ought to be understood, that is, as one with a split or double reference of ETÁD. The there- deictic d-pronoun points simultaneously in two different directions, at divergent targets that are more-or-less mid-distantly removed; it refers both forward \(→\) or downward \(↓\) \[=cataphorical deixis\] and backward \(←\) or upward \(↑\) \[=anaphorical deixis\]: as this, to what follows shortly after, in the yád- phrase; as that, to what precedes at some distance, inside or outside the text. 

By the smallest of changes, Whitney’s translation of ŚS 11.3.50** ** etád** . . . ** yád odanáḥ** **

\(“This** **– namely, ** ** the  rice-dish – ”\) can be transformed into mine \(‘ This** **– namely** ** that** **rice-dish –’\). 

The ETÁD–YÁD Construction in Vedic

‘ This – namely that rice-dish – symbolizes the \(arched\) surface of the sun.’166

“That  is not consonant \(? asaṃyát \[sic\!\]\) with my mind \[and\] heart, that I, a brother, should lie in a sister’s bed \( śáyana\).” \(W&L\)

‘ This – namely that – \[would be\] discordant \( ásaṃyat\) to my mind and heart, that I as \[your\] brother should be lying there \( śáyīya\) in \[my\] sister’s lair \( śáyane\).’167

**8  The End Result en raccourci**

In the ETÁD– YÁD construction of R̥V and AV \(see examples \[1\]–\[13\] in section A.\), the YÁD–phrase has the status of an apposition; it only serves the purpose of describing – at least, to a certain extent – the contents of ETÁD ‘ that . . . there’, the d-pronoun functioning more or less independently, on account of its distinctive there- deictic character. 

The** ** there- deictic** **pronoun** **‘ that’** **of “that** **rice-dish” is more emphatic, or has a greater demonstrative force, than the article ‘ the’ of “the** **rice-dish”. And yes, emphasis is needed. 

**165** The nouns viṣṭáp- f. and viṣṭápa- n. ‘\(arched\) surface’ \(R̥V 12x: viṣṭápam \[5x\], viṣṭápas \[1x\], viṣṭápā \[1x\], viṣṭápi \[5x\]; ŚS 6x: viṣṭápam \[2x\], viṣṭápi \[4x\]\) can be explained as decasuative deriva-tions based on either the nom.sg. \(✶ viṣṭáp\) or the loc.pl. \(✶ viṣṭápsu\) of an original but unattested feminine ✶ vi-ṣṭábh-. Cf. the noun viṣṭambhá- m. ‘prop’ \(R̥V 5x; the five occurrences, all of which refer to Soma, are found in Song-Cycle Nine, and always in combination with divás \[: ‘prop of heaven’\]\) or the verbal compound ví-stambhi ‘to prop apart’ \(R̥V 6x; in all six text-places, the verb is construed with cosmic realities as objects of the verbal action “auseinander stemmen”: four times 

‘the two world-halves’ \[ ródasī\], once ‘these six spaces’ \[ ṣáḷ imā́ rájāṁsi\], and once ‘the ends of the earth’ \[ jmó ántān\]\); cf. Knobl 2022: 131 n.14. 

For a discussion of the heterogeneous case-forms of** ** viṣṭáp- f. /** ** viṣṭápa- n., especially of the neuter nom. pl. ** ** viṣṭápā** **at R̥V 8.91.5** ** imā́ni trī́ṇi viṣṭápā** **. . . ** ‘** Die** **drei Oberflächen** ** hier . . . \(: das** **

Haupt \[ da\] von Papa, ** ** das** **Saatfeld \[ dort\] \[von uns\], und  das hier** **unten an meinem Bauch\)’ in the Indra-Apālā Hymn, see Knobl 2022: 130–132 \(A. Ellipse, example \(1\), and “Exkurs 1” with notes 11–17\). 

**166** We are perhaps allowed to imagine that the sacrificial rice-dish is shining with a golden cover or coating \(“icing”/“frosting”\) of hot and melting clarified butter \( ghr̥tá-  n. ‘ghee’ \[R̥V 123x\]\); and that thus the dish has yet another characteristic in common with the sun – apart from its heat, the round shape, and the arched surface – , so that we would have one more good reason to see it as an image and symbol of the sun. 

**167** Or else, ‘ if I . . . were to be lying there’. For \[1\] the optative śáyīya as a potential mood, \[2\] the there- deictic Vedic root śay/ śi ‘to be lying there’, and \[3\] the etymological construction  śáyane . . . 

śáyīya, see above, footnote 105.

Werner Knobl 

In the ETÁD– yád construction of Vedic prose, which is first attested in the Atharvaveda – implicitly at \[19\] PS 6.9.1 \(see section D.\), explicitly at \[20\] PS 9.21.1–

12 \(see section E.\) and at \[1\] ŚS 9.5.21, \[2\] ŚS 9.5.31b, \[3\] ŚS 9.6.23, \[4\] ŚS 9.6.37, \[5\] ŚS 

11.3.50, or \[6\] ŚS 18.1.14cd \(see section G.\) –, yád restricts and defines ETÁD. 

It is characteristic of the ETÁD– yád construction that the d-pronoun points at what follows in the yád- phrase \( this- reference\) and, simultaneously, at what precedes in the context \( that- reference\); this “split or double reference” of ETÁD 

is introduced in section C., with three examples taken from R̥V and AV: \[16\] R̥V 

10.10.3ab \(= ŚS 18.1.3ab ≈ PS 18.57.3ab\), \[17\] R̥V 10.10.11cd \(= ŚS 18.1.12cd ≈ PS 

18.58.2cd\), and \[18\] ŚS 18.1.14cd \(≈ PS 18.58.4cd\). 

The yád- phrase always contains a noun, the YÁD–phrase only exceptionally, to wit, in the two relative clauses at \[5\] R̥V 6.41.3d  yás te ánnam and at \[12\] R̥V 10.16.8c \(≈ ŚS 18.3.53c\) yáś ca camasó of section A.
