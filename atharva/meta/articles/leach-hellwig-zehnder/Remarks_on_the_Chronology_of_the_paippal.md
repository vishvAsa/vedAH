title = "Remarks on the Chronology of the Paippalāda Saṃhitā"

+++

**Abstract:** The Paippalāda Saṃhitā, which can be viewed as a manual for the purohita, is chronologically heterogeneous: we find old mantras next to prose passages which look young, and archaic verb forms next to grammatical innovations. It 

seems likely that the bulk of its hymns have acquired their final shape at approximately the same time as Book X of the RV, but the text as a whole was presumably 

canonized only later, at the time of the Gr̥hyasūtras. 

**1  The Paippalāda Saṃhitā \(PS\) as a Manual **

**for the purohita**

1.1 Recent studies of the PS have shown that this text can be viewed as a collection of mantras which a king’s domestic priest must remember in order to perform all 

the necessary rituals at the court. Selva \(2019: 214ff\) has presented the major arguments for this viewpoint and ample references, so that I can be brief. 

The Paippalāda Brahmins openly claimed to be best equipped for the office of 

the king’s purohita  or guru. As stated in the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa \(2.4.1–5\), paip-palādaṃ guruṃ kuryāc chrīrāṣṭrārogyavardhanam ‘\[The king\] should appoint a Paippalāda as his domestic priest for the increase of might, kingship, and health’. 

Book 10 of the PS contains a stock of hymns for the royal inauguration, and many 

hymns in other Books are also related to kingship in one or other fashion, see the list in Lelli \(2020: 27–28\). It is significant that most of these hymns are absent from the Śaunakīya Saṃhitā \(ŚS\). 

There is one more aspect in which the PS is more “royal-oriented” than the ŚS. 

As is stressed by Witzel \(1997: 278\), the PS often uses \(hyper-\)correct forms, presumably in order to become more acceptable for the nobility \(see further below, fn. 11\). 

Furthermore, there are Atharvaveda \(AV\) hymns \(both in the PS and the ŚS\) 

which at first sight have nothing to do with kingship, but which turn out to be intimately related to the royal rituals. For instance, it is very probable that a hymn to the waters refers to the waters of the royal consecration \(Tucker 2014\), that a hymn to an amulet is directly related to royal power \(Whitaker 2004\), that the wedding hymn describes a royal wedding \(as Kristen de Joseph argued at the Zürich conference\), and that the funeral hymn describes a royal funeral \(Roland Pooth, this volume\).

Staying at court had not only advantages. The Atharvaveda Brahmins needed 

charms to protect themselves and their property from kings who would take away 

Brahmins’ cows \(ŚS 5.18–19 = PS 9.17–18\) or would abduct Brahmins’ wives \(ŚS 

5.17 = PS 9.15; for PS 8.15 see below, section 6\). 

Of course, all this does not mean that every single PS hymn is necessarily 

related to kingship. There are plenty of hymns which had to be remembered and 

recited during various domestic rituals: healing of all sorts, protection of cattle and crops, rituals concerning conception and birth, love charms, etc. 

1.2 It has often been observed in the scholarly literature that the Atharvaveda is chronologically heterogeneous: we find old mantras next to prose passages which 

look young,1 and archaic verb forms next to grammatical innovations. This hetero-

geneity squares well with the proposed function of the text: being a king’s domestic priest requires constant adaptation to the new techniques, new rituals, and, most importantly, to the ever-changing preferences of the sovereigns. No doubt, competition was fierce, and innovation must have been vital. 

Presumably, one of the competing groups were the R̥gvedins. It is well known that Book X is the final addition to the codified R̥gveda \(RV\) and that it shares not only many linguistic peculiarities with the AV, but also the subject-matter of a considerable number of hymns, for instance, life-cycle rituals such as the funeral and the wedding, healing spells and curses, and so forth \(see, e.g., the introduction to Book X by Jamison & Brereton 2014: 1367\). The question as to why these AV-like hymns were added to the collection has rarely been asked, but it seems reasonable to assume that the R̥gvedins, too, wanted to be employed not only in the solemn Soma rituals, and so they borrowed some charms from the AV, which allowed them to perform the domestic rituals. 

**2  Language of the AV: Archaisms and Innovations**

The language of most hymns of the AV is less archaic than that of the Family books of the RV \(being similar to that of RV X\), but this does not necessarily mean that all AV hymns are late compositions. Some of the charms, at least in their subject-matter, could be of great antiquity, cf. ŚS 4.12 = PS 4.15 ‘To heal an open fracture: with a plant’ \(most recently treated in Griffiths & Lubotsky 2000–2001\), which is often cited in this connection because of its Germanic and Hittite parallels. Furthermore, we find remarkable archaisms in the text, of which I here give just two types of 

phenomena, one morphological and one lexical:

**1** See below, section 5.3, on the argument that this is not just an impression, but a linguistic reality. 

Remarks on the Chronology of the Paippalāda Saṃhitā 

[[75]]

\(1\) Middle imperative endings of the statives:



3sg. impv. med. of the root-aor. padām of pad- ‘to fall, lie down’. PS 5.15.7a reads ni te padāṃ pr̥thivī yantu ✶ sindhavaḥ ‘Let the Earth lie down for you, let the rivers go \[their course\]’. This is a hapax with an archaic ending -ām \(instead of -tām\), typical of statives / intransitive middles, cf. śayām \(AV\) to śi- 

‘to lie’, duhā́m \(RV\) to duh- ‘to yield \(milk\)’. This form suits well the other forms of the intransitive middle root pad- \(for subj. padāti see Insler 1968: 317, fn. 7\). 



vi śerām \[3pl. impv. med.\] \(PS 2.73.3\) of śi- ‘to lie’, a hapax, parallel to duhrā́m \(AV\). The ending -rā́m is not found in the RV. 

\(2\)  puvas- n. \(PS 4.14.3c\) ‘pus’: asno gandhāt puvasaḥ pra cyavasva ‘Emerge from the blood, from the smell, from the pus’. Although the word puvas- is not attested elsewhere in Vedic or later Sanskrit, it is a perfect match of Greek πύος 

n. ‘pus’, Latin pūs, pūris n. ‘id.’ ← PIE ✶ puH-os-. On this hymn, see Griffiths & Lubotsky 2014. 

At the same time, there are numerous morphological innovations in the AV as 

compared with the Family books of the RV. For instance, whereas in the Family 

books we only sporadically find cases of gen. sg. - yāḥ, dat. - yāi, loc. - yām with fem. 

i- stems,2 these endings are the norm in the AV; similarly, monosyllabic iva,  3 rare in the RV, is very frequent in the AV. 

In the PS, we encounter for the first time a future in -tar- \(see Lubotsky 2002: 68\), and 1pl. vidmas\(i\).4 A unique PS innovation seems to be the loc. sg. patyām \(6×\) vs. the usual pátā\(u\) of páti- ‘husband’. 

Many archaic features gradually disappear. For example, outside of RV repeti-

tions, we hardly find any injunctives in a non-imperative context, very few exam-

ples of tmesis \(separated preverbs\), of nom. pl. m. - āsaḥ and of metrical lengthening of word final vowels. It is further conspicuous that the PS attests a considerable number of words that are Vedic hapax legomena, e.g., śikhara- m./n. ‘top, peak’ 

\(4.14.5\), sūta-  m. ‘child, son’ \(5.37.4\), prapautra-  m. ‘great-grandson’ \(5.40.5\). 

Consequently, although we cannot establish a secure terminus post quem for the AV, it is likely that the bulk of its hymns have acquired their final shape at **2** Type nírr̥tyāḥ, - yāi, - yām  to nírr̥ti-, goddess of perdition, cf. AiGr. III: 135. 

**3** For an explanation of this phenomenon, see Pinault 1995–1996: 354–361. 

**4** The regular form 1pl. pf. vidma is abundantly attested in the PS, but vidmas\(i\) is found in five passages. In PS 16.13.7d yāsu vidmasi saṁbhr̥tam and 17.12.1f, 13.9e nāmadheyāni vidmasi, the form vidmasi is secured by the meter, which conclusively shows that it is not a mistake of the transmission, but an original 1pl. form of the PS, although it is not attested in the ŚS. The present form vidmas\(i\) is most probably due to the reinterpretation of ppf. avet as an imperfect. 

**76** 

Alexander Lubotsky

approximately the same time as Book X of the RV. We shall discuss the terminus ante quem below, but in order to see the AV innovations in due perspective, let us first have a look at the general picture of linguistic developments after the RV. 

**3  Sound Changes after the RV**

There are hardly any sound changes between the language of the RV and Classi-

cal Sanskrit. The sound differences that we see are either purely phonetic details5 

or are due to variation during the transmission of the texts.6 This fact, the importance of which has not been fully appreciated in the scholarly literature, means 

that during or soon after the period of the composition of the RV, Sanskrit ceased to be a living language in the sense that it was only used in specific situations, in a high stylistic register, and became “petrified” to some extent. From that moment on, Sanskrit was only affected by morphological and syntactic changes. 

**4  Prākritisms in the RV? **

Can we determine the date when this petrification started? Much depends on the 

question as to whether the RV contains so-called Prākritisms, i.e., words that show Middle Indic phonetic developments. There is a certain tradition among Indo-Eu-ropeanists to etymologize \(usually obscure\) Sanskrit words by assuming Prākritic 

developments even in the earliest Vedic. 

A typical example is the RV hapax ogaṇá-. The only passage where it occurs reads: 10.89.15ab śatrūyánto abhí yé nas tatasré, máhi vrā́dhanta ogaṇā́sa indra. 

Jamison & Brereton \(2014: 1537\) translate: ‘Those who, seeking to rival us, have battered at us, being greatly arrogant and powerful, o Indra’, following Geldner in glossing ogaṇá-  as ‘powerful’, although there is no foundation for it in the context. 

**5** For instance, the monophthongization ✶ ai > e and ✶ au > o \(for which, see Lubotsky 2012\), some sandhi differences \(e.g. RV -ṣ ṭ- in vidúṣ ṭe ‘they know of you’ vs. Class. -s t-\), etc. See further Witzel 1997. A more complicated issue is RV ✶ CiyV and ✶ CuvV vs. Class. CyV and CvV. In unstressed position, the contraction had already taken place before the RV, and the poet had the license to use either a disyllabic or a monosyllabic form \(e.g. divyá- / diviyá-, for details see Lubotsky 1997: 149ff.\). 

When stressed, ✶ CíyV and ✶ CúvV normally remained disyllabic. This is also the situation of the AV. 

The Taittirīyas still have súvaḥ, vr̥kíyaḥ, etc. for svàḥ, vr̥kyàḥ. In Classical Sanskrit, this contraction has become generalized to all contexts. 

**6** E.g., RV -VḷV- vs. Class. -VḍV-, which is a matter of pronunciation during transmission \(like saṃskrutam or saṃskritam for saṃskr̥tam\). 

Remarks on the Chronology of the Paippalāda Saṃhitā 

[[77]]

One would rather expect a negative connotation like ‘treacherous’, ‘murderous’, 

‘brutal’, ‘fierce’. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that ogaṇá- means ‘powerful’ 

and goes back to ✶ ogr̥ṇa- < PIE ✶ h₂eug-r- \+ an adjective suffix -na- \(see EWAia 1.276–

277 with references\). What is more, in the PS and the Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā \(VS\) we 

find úgaṇa- in very similar contexts, specifying an inimical sénā- ‘army’ \(mentioned next to thieves and robbers\), cf. VS 11.77 \(= PS 1.42.1\) sénā abhī́tvarīr āvyādhínīr úgaṇā uta ‘the attacking, murdering and úgaṇāḥ armies.’ In the Sāmaveda we further find nom. sg. ugaṇā 7 \(SVK 1.336b yo no vanuṣyann abhidāti marta ugaṇā vā 

manyamānas turo vā ‘a man, who is hostile, plotting against us, ugaṇā or considering himself strong’\), again in a negative context. This úgaṇa- is also usually etymologized as an Indo-European word, this time as ✶ ugr̥ṇa- < PIE ✶ h₂ug-r- \+ an adjective suffix -na- \(EWAia 1.276–277\). 

It follows that the meaning of ogaṇá- /  úgaṇa- is unclear and that the different ablaut grades and accentuation, as well as the nom. sg.  ugaṇā, are unaccounted for.8 Furthermore, the formation \(an r- stem \+ a suffix -na-\) is unparalleled. It seems therefore unjustified to postulate a Middle Indic development for ogaṇá- /  úgaṇa-only in order to save an Indo-European etymology, which is not even very appeal-

ing because of the morphological problems. 

This is not the place to discuss all proposed Prākritisms in the RV, but most 

of them meet the above-mentioned objections and are doubtful. In my view, the 

best example is a passage from the so-called Frog hymn, RV 7.103.3cd: akhkhalīkŕ̥-

tyā pitáraṃ ná putró,  anyó anyám úpa vádantam eti ‘saying “akhkhala” \[/repeating syllables\] like a son to a father \(at lessons\), one goes up close to the other who is speaking.’ This translation by Jamison & Brereton \(2014: 1013\) follows Thieme’s \(1954\) suggestion that akhkhala-  is a Middle-Indic reflex of akṣára- ‘syllable’, which reveals the pun of the author of the hymn, who constantly tries to create parallels between the frogs and the Brahmins. We must thus assume that the author already 

said akhkhala- for akṣára- in his daily life. Since RV 7.103 is an “Anhang” hymn, belonging to the latest additions to the collection, it would mean that Middle Indic developments started to take place at least at the very latest stages of the codifica-tion of this text. 

**7** This unusual nominative is also encountered in the name of an ancient sage uśánā- \(RV\+\), i.e. 

uśánā kāvyá-, which is likely to be of non-Indo-European origin. 

**8** It is sometimes assumed that ugo is due to the influence of ugrá-, but the accent shows that this idea cannot be correct. 

**78** 

Alexander Lubotsky

**5  Prākrit-like Sound Changes in the RV**

Although the direct evidence for Prākritisms in the RV is limited, the language of this text, even of its oldest parts, already shows a few sound changes which foreshadow the later, Middle Indic, developments. This points at a situation of prolonged contacts with the indigenous population of India, which became increasingly intensive with the years. 

**5.1  Proto-Indo-Iranian **✶ **di̯- > ** **Skt. jy-**

This sound change is found in two Rigvedic words: jyótiṣ- n. ‘light, brightness’ and jyók /jiyók/ adv. ‘a long time, still a long time, already a long time’. In later Vedic, it is further attested in the middle present jyotate ‘to shine’ \(MS jyotatām 3sg. impv.\), passive ava-jyotyámāna- \(ŚB\), absolutive ava-jyótya \(Br.\+\), and the nouns jyótsnā-f. ‘moonlight night’ \(MS\+\) and jyotayamāmaka- m. ‘will-o’-the-wisp’ \(ŚS 4.37.10\) = 

jyotaya mām ‘shine on me\!’ \+ suffix -aká-. 

It was convincingly argued by aan de Wiel 2000 that the Vedic sound change 

✶ di̯- >  jy- only took place in the position before o \(which at that time still was ✶ au 

\[əu\]\), whereas dy- remained unchanged in all other positions. 

In Middle Indic, any ✶ dy has become -jj- in intervocalic position and j- word-initially \(see von Hinüber 1986: 120–121\). 

**5.2  Vedic “vowel harmony” \+ r****-dissimilation**

In Vedic, there are several cases where vocalic r̥ loses its consonantal element and becomes i, u,  or a, depending on the following vowel, cf. 

– ✶ śr̥thirá- \[śərthirá-\] > \[śirthirá-\]  > śithirá- adj. ‘loose’ \(root śrathi- ‘to be loose’\). 



– ✶ mr̥hur \[mə́rhur\] > \[múrhur\]  > múhur ‘suddenly, at once, immediately’ \(cf. 

Young Avestan mərəzu- ‘short’\). 



– ✶ durhŕ̥ṇā- \[durhə́rṇā-\] > \[durhárṇā-\] > durháṇā- ‘bad anger’ \(~ hr̥ṇīté ‘to be angry’\) \(see Narten 1982: 140\). 



– ✶ tvŕ̥ṣṭar- \[tvə́rṣṭar-\] >  \[tvárṣṭar-\] > tváṣṭar- \(cf. Avestan ϑβōrəštar- ‘sculptor, creator’\) \(see Lubotsky 1994\). 

These forms are the result of r- dissimilation, and the schwa of vocalic r̥ \[ər\] copies the vowel of the next syllable. This “vowel harmony” is very similar to the rules for the development of r̥  in Middle Indic \(see Berger 1955\):

Remarks on the Chronology of the Paippalāda Saṃhitā 

[[79]]



– hr̥daya- > Pāli hadaya-; ghr̥ta- >  Pāli ghata-; kr̥pana- > Pāli kapana-; vr̥ka- >  Pāli vaka-



– r̥ṣi- > Pāli isi-; kr̥mi- >  Pāli kimi-; vr̥ścika- >  Pāli vicchika-; kr̥trima- > Pāli kittima-



– r̥tu- >  Pāli utu-; r̥ju- > Pāli uju-; mr̥du- > Pāli mudu-It follows that the vowel harmony \(or assimilation of the schwa to the vowel of 

the next syllable\) started as a phonetic development already in Vedic and has 

become phonemic only if -r-  was lost. In Middle Indic, this process has spread to any former r̥. 

**5.3  Skt. karoti, kurvanti**

A very similar scenario is responsible for the development of karóti, kurvánti \(Class 8 present\) from kr̥ṇóti, kr̥ṇvánti \(Class 5 present\) as argued by Hoffmann \(1976: 575–588\). He assumes that in this verb, - r̥ṇ- has exceptionally assimilated to -r̥r-, which then underwent “vowel harmony” and r- loss:

– kr̥ṇu- / kr̥ṇv- > ✶ kr̥ru- / kr̥rv- > \[kurru- / kurrv-\] >  kuru- / kurv-



– ✶ kr̥ṇau- > ✶ kr̥rau- > \[karrau-\] > karo- 9

According to Hoffmann, these forms are used in Vedic texts as follows:



– RV: predominantly Class 5 kr̥ṇo- / kr̥ṇu-, but in Book X already 2× kuru \(10.19.2b púnar enā ny ā́ kuru; 10.145.2d pátim me kévalaṃ kuru\) and 1× kurmás \(10.51.7a kurmás ta ā́yur ajáraṃ yád agne\)10



– AV: Class 5 kr̥ṇo- / kr̥ṇu-  next to \(rare\) Class 8 karo- / kuru-



– YV mantras \(both prose and poetry\): idem



– YV prose: only Class 8 karo- / kuru-

**9** Vedic e and o were diphthongs \[ai\] and \[au\], at least until the time of the composition of the Yajurveda \(see Lubotsky 2012\). 

**10** As was pointed out by Hoffmann, in the RV the poets use Class 8 forms as an indication of colloquial / substandard usage, especially female speech. The same is true of the Atharvaveda, see, for instance, PS 5.34, ‘Against a female rival’, where we find three times a Class 8 present: 2ab ā krandayolulā kuru,  vācam ā dhehiy apriyām ‘Shout out, wail, raise your unpleasant voice\!’, 5cd  

atho śvabhyo ✶ rāyadbhiyaḥ,  prati sma gaṅgaṇaṃ kuru ‘And then howl back to the barking dogs\!’, 6c atho yat kāriyaṃ kuruv ‘And do what has to be done\!’ or PS 6.23 ‘To get rid of a rival wife’ with its 2a apāñcaṁ patim ā kuruv ‘Make the husband turn away \[from her\]’, 4b bilād araṇyam ā kuruv 

‘Remove \[her\] from the hole toward the jungle’, 4e vātasyaināṃ śikhāṃ kuru ‘make her the crest of the wind’ \(Griffiths 2009: 247 and 249\). 

**80** 

Alexander Lubotsky

Hoffmann has missed just one minor detail, which is of importance for the chronology of the Atharvaveda, however. It turns out that the Śaunakīya Saṃhitā11 shows 

the same distribution as the Yajurveda: in the mantras we find most of the time 

Class 5 kr̥ṇo- / kr̥ṇu-  next to a few rare occurrences of Class 8 karo- / kuru-, indeed, but – and this is the difference – the prose passages exclusively attest Class 8 karo- / 

kuru-. This distribution indicates that the prose passages of the AV have been added to the collection at a later date \(see further below\). 

**6  Canonization of the Atharvaveda Paippalāda**

Most Vedic texts contain material from different periods, and it must have taken 

a long time before they were canonized and reached the form in which they have 

been transmitted to us \(for a recent discussion, see Bronkhorst 2007: 175ff.\). 

What can be said about the time of canonization of the Atharvaveda, and of 

the Paippalāda Saṃhitā in particular? The distribution discussed in the preceding section suggests that the prose of the Atharvaveda \(the so-called paryāya sections\) and that of the Yajurveda are contemporary, which confirms the impression of 

many scholars that the Atharvaveda prose is composed in a Brāhmaṇa style. At the 

same time, it means that the canonization of the Atharvaveda took place no earlier than the period of the Brāhmaṇa prose. 

Indeed, there are indications that canonization took place even later. A case 

in point is the stanza PS 8.15.6 \(for the edition of this hymn see Lubotsky 2007 and Kim 2014: 145–146\):

śatarcino mādhyamā ye maharṣayaḥ \(12\)

kṣudrasūktānām uta yā prajeha | \(11\)

r̥ṣīṇāṃ yāni janimāni vidmas \(11\)

tebhyaḥ pra brūma iha kilbiṣāṇi || \(11\)

‘The \[descendants of the\] Śatarcins, \[the descendants of\] the great r̥ṣis who have composed the middle parts, and those here who are the progeny of those whose hymns are short – 

whichever races of the r̥ṣis we know, to them we announce here the offenses.’

This stanza mentions the authors of the R̥gvedic hymns, which are only known 

since the late texts of the R̥gveda school: the mādhyamāḥ are referred to at KauṣB 

12.3:5ff., the earliest other attestation of śatarcinaḥ seems to be at AitĀ 2.2.1 \(alongside the mādhyamāḥ\), and the kṣudrasūktāḥ are not referred to before the Gr̥hyas-11 The PS has mostly reintroduced Class 5 kr̥ṇo- / kr̥ṇu- in these cases, in a conscious endeavor to use the more “correct”, archaic language \(see above, section 1\). 

Remarks on the Chronology of the Paippalāda Saṃhitā 

[[81]]

ūtras \(ŚāṅkhGr̥S 4.10, ĀśvGr̥S 3.4.2\). It is therefore conceivable that the stanza is a late addition, which is further corroborated by its strange position within the hymn \(see Lubotsky 2007: 28\). 

This means that even at the time of the Gr̥hyasūtras, close to the end of the Vedic period, the charms were still adapted and rearranged. In this particular case of PS 

8.15.6, the reason for expanding the text was clearly the endeavor to involve the RV brahmins in a protest against the king who has abducted a brahmin’s wife. And 

although this process of adding new material to the collection, theoretically speaking, might have continued until the Middle Ages, I see no indication of that. As far as the terminus ante quem for canonization of the Atharvaveda is concerned, I follow Johannes Bronkhorst, who writes \(2007: 197\): “Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya allows us 

to obtain an approximate idea as to the time before which the Atharvaveda was 

constituted into a collected whole. It cites in its opening passage the first lines of the four Vedas; these apparently existed as collections in those days \(second century BCE\). The first line is śaṃ no devīr abhiṣṭaye, which begins the Paippalāda version of the Atharvaveda. Patañjali even informs us of the size of the Atharvaveda known to him, saying \(Mahā-bh\[āṣya\] II p. 378 l. 11; on P. 5.2.37\): viṃśino ’ṅgirasaḥ.  This fits the twenty books of the Atharvaveda in both its surviving versions. We may 

conclude that the Paippalāda Saṃhitā existed essentially in its present form in the second century BCE.”
