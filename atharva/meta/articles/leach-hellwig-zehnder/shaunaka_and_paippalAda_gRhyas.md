**The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda Śākhās **

**of the Atharvaveda **

**A Comparative Study of Their Domestic Rituals**

**Abstract:** The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda are the only surviving schools of the Atharvaveda. There are a number of texts explaining in detail the domestic rituals of the Śaunaka; on the contrary, there are very few texts on the domestic rituals of the Paippalāda. The Śaunaka school spread over various parts of India and had 

a good textual tradition, beginning with the Kauśika-Sūtra of the Atharvaveda, a 

major Sūtra text, traditionally called a Saṃhitāvidhi, followed by an incomplete 

Bhāṣya, Paddhatis and Prayogas. However, there is hardly any living tradition of the Śaunakīyas performing these rituals at present, despite the fact that an attempt at the revival of the domestic rituals has been made by Raviśaṅkara Nāgara, the author of the Atharvavedaprayogabhānu, a Prayoga text from Gujarat. The Paippalādins, 

now found only in Odisha, have a living tradition but a limited number of texts on domestic rituals. They still perform certain domestic rituals with the help of their Saṃhitā and priestly manuals. A critical edition of the Karmapañjikā, edited by Arlo Griffiths and Shilpa Sumant, is an important contribution to Paippalāda studies; it throws light on the domestic rituals, most of which are still being performed today. 

The present article aims at a comparative study of the domestic rituals as 

explained by the texts belonging to the two schools of the Atharvaveda. It deals with some domestic rituals, the mantras used in their performance, the ritual described by the relevant texts, the original form of the rituals, the influence of other Vedic schools, the influence of non-Vedic schools, and so on. 

**1 The Two Śākhās of the Atharvaveda**

As we are aware, there existed as many as nine Śākhās ‘schools’ or ‘recensions’ of the Atharvaveda \(AV\),1 of which there survive only two, namely, the Śaunaka and 

the Paippalāda, the former existing in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Mahar-

ashtra and Uttar Pradesh, and the latter only in Orissa, now called Odisha \(Bahulkar 2016: 113\). A comparative study of these Śākhās is a vast subject and involves a

comparison between the Saṃhitās of these two Śākhās, the Upaniṣads, the ancillary texts, a linguistic study of both the Saṃhitās, the ritualistic tradition and so on. In the present article, I shall concentrate on a comparative study of the basic domestic ritual \( tantra\) of these two Śākhās. The domestic rituals in the Atharvaveda tradition have already been studied by some scholars who have focussed their attention mainly on the domestic rituals of the Śaunaka Śākhā,2 and rarely on those of the Paippalāda.3 

The main reason for ignoring the Paippalāda was that the sources for the study of the rituals of that Śākhā were not easily available until recent years. A comparative study of the rituals of these two Śākhās therefore still demands our attention. What is the scope of this study? Well, theoretically, one is expected to study all the rituals that come under the category called Gṛhya or non-solemn or domestic rituals of the Atharvavedins. While most of the domestic rituals are common to all the four Vedas, there are certain rituals that could be termed as typically Atharvavedic, for example, the pacificatory rites \( śāntika\), remedies to cure diseases \( bhaiṣajya\), sorcery rites \( abhicāra\), rites that involve oblations of a variety of cooked rice \( savayajña\) and so on.4 These rituals are rarely described in the tradition of the other three Vedas. 

**2 Five Kalpas**

There are five ritual texts in the Śaunaka tradition; they are called Kalpas and enumerated in a verse popular in that tradition. It reads:

nakṣatrakalpo vaitānas tṛtīyaḥ saṃhitāvidhiḥ |

caturtho ’ṅgirasāṃ kalpaḥ śāntikalpas tu pañcamaḥ ||

Kauśikapaddhati 5 \(KP, p. 2\)

**2** The Kauśika-Sūtra is the main source of the ritual of that Śākhā and has been dealt with by Bloomfield 1972, 1973, 1978 and Caland 1967. As Gonda 1977: 612 rightly points out, “After Bloomfield and Caland it attracted but a very limited number of scholars, no doubt on the one hand because of the character of its text which has been badly preserved and is written in a very terse and often obscure style.” 

**3** Bhattacharya 1968: 34–45; Griffiths & Sumant 2018. In his recent work, The Veda in Kashmir, Witzel \(2020\) furnishes valuable information on the Paippalāda Śākhā in Kashmir. In the Appendices, he reproduces lists of Kashmirian priestly manuals \( ṛcaka\). However, the lists contain mainly the rituals of the Kāṭhaka Śākhā of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda and not those of the Paippalāda. 

**4** Bloomfield 1972: xxi writes: “\[. . .\] we may at any rate safely speak of the Kauśika as a mixture of two distinct kinds of sūtras, Atharva-sūtras, and gṛhya-sūtras.” He further argues that the atharva-sūtra proper begins at Kaṇḍikā 7, and extends to 53. \(1972: xxviii\). For a detailed discussion and examination of his argument, see, Bahulkar 1977: 91–120; 1994: 21–38. 

**5** This is an elaborate commentary focussed on explaining the rituals \( paddhati\) by Keśava, who probably flourished around the 11th century CE and belonged to the Malwa region of Central India. 

The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda Śākhās of the Atharvaveda  

[[351]]

The Nakṣatrakalpa, The Vaitāna \(i. e., the Vaitānasūtra\), the Saṃhitāvidhi \(i. e. the Kauśi ka-Sūtra\) – 

the third, the Kalpa of the Aṅgirases – the fourth, and the Śāntikalpa – the fifth.6

Keśava further quotes the opinion of Upavarṣācārya who states that \(in respect of the authority\), “these Kalpas are equal to the Vedas” \( ete kalpā vedatulyāḥ\).7

In the tradition of the Śaunaka, the Kauśika-Sūtra \(KauS\) is regarded as the Gṛhyasūtra and the Vaitānasūtra \(VaitS\) as the Śrautasūtra. Thus, whatever is included in the KauS could be treated as the domestic ritual of the Śaunaka Śākhā in contradistinction with that described in the VaitS. Accordingly, all the rituals described in the KauS are to be performed with the help of one \(domestic\) fire \( ekāgnisādhya\), while the rituals in the VaitS need the three sacred fires used in the solemn sacrifices \( tretāgnisādhya\). For the performance of the domestic rituals of the Śaunaka, only three or four persons are required – the sacrificer, his wife, the performer priest \( kartā\) and, at times, the Brahmā.8 In the case of the Śrauta rituals, the sacrificer, his wife, the Adhvaryu, the Hotā, the Brahmā and other priests depending upon the rite to be performed are needed. The Śrauta ritual described in the VaitS 

bears similarity with that found in the tradition of the first three Vedas with certain peculiarities.9 Since we are not discussing the Śrauta ritual in this paper, we keep that topic aside and turn to the Gṛhya rituals of the Atharvavedins. 

As regards the explanation of the Paddhati-type of commentary, Rājaśekhara, in the beginning of his Kāvyamīmāṃsā says: sūtrāṇāṃ sakalasāravivaraṇaṃ vṛttiḥ | sūtravṛttivivecanaṃ paddhatiḥ 

\(Siromani 1934: 5\). “The Vṛtti\(-type commentary\) fully explains the essence of the Sūtra; the Paddhati\(-type of commentary\) elucidates the Vṛtti.” Besides this explanation, we find that the Bhāṣya \(-type of commentary\) explains each and every word of the Sūtra and a Paddhati further elaborates the explanation offered by the Bhāṣya. For Keśava’s date and place, see, Limaye et al 1982: xxxv–xxxviii. 

**6** Out of the five Kalpas, we find only four in the tradition of the Śaunaka, i. e., the first three and the fifth. I have pointed out in one of my papers that the Āṅgirasakalpa which existed in the Śaunaka tradition and which was available to Dārila, Keśava and Sāyaṇa had already been lost and that the work available to us at present is a late text composed perhaps to fulfil the need of the fifth Kalpa by the Atharvavedins of the Paippalāda Śākhā in Odisha \(Bahulkar 1987: 579\). For a detailed study, see Sanderson 2007: 195–311. The text has been published by Paṇḍā 2003 under the title Paippalada Vashadisatkarma Paddhatih \( Paippalādavaśādiṣaṭkarmapaddhatiḥ\). 

**7** Upavarṣācārya seems to have flourished sometime before Śabarasvāmin, the great Mīmāṃsā 

commentator \(Dasgupta 1952: 107; also 7, n. 3; 105, n. 2\). For a discussion on his commentaries etc., see Bronkhorst 2007: 281, 282, 284, 287, 293, 294. 

**8** In the domestic rituals of the Śaunaka, the role of the Brahmā is mostly optional. See Bahulkar 2004: 509–516. 

**9** “The only available Śrautasūtra of the Atharvaveda, the Vaitāna, is not – as was taken for granted by Garbe, Hillebrandt and Bloomfield, an ordinary śrauta manual for the use of the Atharvavedins. 

As shown by Caland, it appears from the paribhāṣās at the beginning of the work that it is a manual for the officiant known as brahman \[. . .\]” \(Gonda 1977: 543\).

**3 Gṛhya Rituals of the Atharvavedins**

Although the KauS is a Gṛhyasūtra of the Śaunaka Śākhā, it is not a Gṛhyasūtra in the ordinary sense of that term, because it prescribes a number of rites that are not generally found in other Gṛhyasūtras. As a matter of fact, it is the major Sūtra of the Śaunaka Śākhā, describing a variety of rituals in which a major portion of the Śaunaka Saṃhitā \(AVŚ\) has been employed. Thus, it is aptly called Saṃhitāvidhi 

\(see the verse quoted above\). The diversity of the rituals can be observed merely by going through the initial Sūtras of the chapters and the sections within the chapters of the KauS or the rituals divided into twenty-one groups by Dārila, the Bhāṣyakāra of the KauS.10 One may also go through the contents of the editio princeps of the KauS, prepared by Bloomfield \(1972 \[1990\]: lxiv–lxviii\). Here it will not be out of place to say a few words about a unique method the KauS adopts for the employment of the mantras and the hymns of the AVŚ in various rites. We can observe that in the KauS, there is a systematic arrangement of the rituals, following the order of the AVŚ. This order is called Mantrādhikāra “a section following the order of 

the mantras \(in the Saṃhitā\)”. Within this order, there is an internal order of the rituals, following the general order of the Gṛhyasūtras. This is called Phalādhikāra 

“a section following the order of the rituals \(literally, fruits\)”. For example, the author of the KauS begins with the very first hymn of the AVŚ by quoting the first mantra of the hymn with its designation pūrva-11 to be employed primarily in the rite of Medhājanana. The rite is prescribed at KauS 2.1\[10\].1–5.12 Then, skipping a number of hymns that follow, the author directly goes to AVŚ 4.30 and employs it in the rite of Jātakarman \(KauS 2.1\[10\].16–19\). Thus, the author intends to group the hymns to be employed in the rites that are to be performed at the birth of a child. 

We find here a combination of the two methods, namely, the Mantrādhikāra and 

**10**  vidhisambandhe ’nena tu kauśikena sājātyena caikaviṃśatividhimantragaṇaṃ pravibhajya vidhiḥ kathitaḥ | Diwekar et al 1972: p. 4, lines 9–10. 

**11** This hymn called triṣaptīya- has “a handy designation”, purva- “the foremost” \(KauS 1.7\[7\].8\). 

The KauS generally uses that designation, except at 14.3\[139\].10. In that connection, Bloomfield 1972 \[1890\]: xxvi points out that the usage of the word triṣaptīya- shows insufficient assimilation of the chapter 14 of the KauS. 

**12** The mode of reference to the sūtras, made here, follows the traditional division of the KauS into Adhyāya, Kaṇḍikā and sūtras. In his edition, Bloomfield retains this mode of reference, but also offers a consecutive numbering of the Kaṇḍikās \(1–141\) from the beginning to the end of the work. 

While referring to the KauS, the mode of reference used by Bloomfield is being generally followed. 

Therefore, for the convenience of the readers, the consecutive numbering of the Kaṇḍikās is also provided here into the square brackets. 

The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda Śākhās of the Atharvaveda  

[[353]]

the Phalādhikāra.13 The KauS describes various rituals beginning with the birth of a child to the funeral ceremonies, generally following these two methods. 

The tradition of the Śaunaka is rich in exegetical works. As regards the KauS, we have good material in the form of commentaries, namely, Dārila’s Bhāṣya \(Diwekar 

et al 1972\), Keśava’s Kauśikapaddhati \(Limaye et al 1982\), anonymous works called Ātharvaṇīyapaddhati, Daśakarmāṇi, Antyeṣṭipaddhati \(Bloomfield 1972 \[1890\]: 

xiv–xvi\) and a number of Prayogas \(Bahulkar 1977: 207–215\).14

While we have the KauS in the Śaunaka Śākhā, we do not have a Sūtra text 

belonging to the Paippalāda;15 we have only a few works, namely, Śrīdhara’s Kar-

mapañjikā \(KarmP\)16 – a Paddhati, and an anonymous work – Karmasamuccaya,17 

a Prayoga.18 In order to compare the arrangement of the rituals, it will be better to use the Paddhatis in both the Śākhās. The KP explains the rituals following their order as described in the KauS. However, the source of the KarmP may not be 

one particular Sūtra. It quotes the mantras for expiatory rites from a text called Saṃhitāvidhikalpa \( saṃhitāvidhikalpoktāḥ prāyaścittamantrāḥ, KarmP, p. 137\). 

However, the mantras are not found in the KauS, which is known as Saṃhitāvidhi 

in the tradition of the Śaunaka. The KarmP also borrows the “Tantra” from the 

Nakṣatrakalpa. Again, it is not found in the Nakṣatrakalpa available at present. 

Here is a comparative chart of the domestic rituals of the two Śākhās, based on 

the KP and the KarmP. 

**13** For a detailed discussion on these two methods, see Bahulkar 1994: 27–30. 

**14** For more information on the Prayogas in the Atharvaveda tradition, see, Garud 2002. 

**15** See footnote 50 below. 

**16** A partial critical edition of this text \(Volume I: Book One, Part One\) has been prepared by Griffiths & Sumant \(2018\). A “modern” Paddhati which claims to be based on the KarmP has been edited by Paṇḍā & Reddy \(2012\). 

**17** In the introduction to his work, Paippalādavaśādi-ṣaṭkarmapaddhatiḥ \[2003\], Paṇḍā says that Śrīdhara wrote two works, namely, Karmapañjikā and Karmasamuccaya \(Paṇḍā \[2003\]: Pūrvābhāsaḥ, unnumbered pages 1 and 2\). He first edited the Karmasamuccaya under the title Paippalāda-Vivāhādi-Saṃskāra- Paddhatiḥ \(2000\). Later on, he edited the KarmP under the title Paippalādabahiḥśālādikaṃ jātasaṃsthādikāḥ kriyāḥ, jointly with Reddy \(Paṇḍā & Reddy 2012\). 

He says that he edited the first work, following the procedure \( vidhi\) as described in the KarmP 

\(Paṇḍā & Reddy 2012: Mukhabandhaḥ, unnumbered pages 1 and 2\). This statement indicates that he became aware of the difference between the two works \(Paṇḍā & Reddy 2012\). For details and on Paṇḍā’s confusing statements see, Sumant 2016: 883–884; Griffiths & Sumant 2018: xxx–xxxi and footnote 24.

This comparative table shows that there is not much similarity between the orders of the rituals in these two texts. 

As mentioned above, the present paper is restricted to presenting preliminary 

observations on the basic ritual as described in the Śaunaka and the Paippalāda 

Saṃhitās. In the Śaunaka tradition of Gujarat, there is an elaborated manual, 

namely, the Atharvaveda prayogabhānu of Raviśaṅkara Nāgara, who belonged to 

the Ṣaṭpannāgara sub-caste of the Nāgara Brahmins. This Prayoga is divided into 

four books, called Prakāśas. The first Prakāśa covers the basic mode of worship 

and some rites. It begins with Gaṇapatipūjana, and describes the rituals that are 

**356**

commonly found in the tradition of other three Vedas. They are Ābhyudayika, 

Mātṛkāpūjana, Nāndīśrāddha, Araṇipūjana, Sūtrokta-Śāntikalaśakaraṇa, Maṇḍa-

papratiṣṭhā, Svastivācana, Puṇyāhavācana, Sthālīpāka, Garbhādhāna, Puṃsavana, 

Sīmantonnayana, Jātakarman and various Śāntis connected with the birth of a 

child. The second book begins with Nāmakaraṇa and describes the rites related to 

the child and to a celibate, such as Upanayana and so on. The third book describes Vivāha, Madhuparka, Caturthikākarma, some other related rites and various Śāntis 

similar to those described in the thirteenth Adhyāya of the KauS. The fourth book deals mainly with funeral rites and ancestral worship. Thus, the work follows the order of the KauS in a very general way.21

In the case of the Paippalāda tradition, we do have a Prayoga text, the Kar-

masamuccaya. This text is based on the Paddhati, the KarmP. However, we do not yet have a critically edited text.22 For the purposes of the present paper, I have therefore used the partial edition of the KarmP, where we can find the relevant 

material for the comparison. 

The KarmP divides the domestic rituals into seven categories called Jātasaṃsthāḥ. 

They are:

Wedding \( vivāha\), impregnation \( garbhakaraṇa\), rite for obtaining a male child \( puṃsavana\), rite for a new-born baby \( jātakarman\), first ritual shaving of a boy \( godāna\), initiation \( upanayana\) and ritual bath of a bachelor \( āplavana\) \[– these are the seven categories\].23

**4 Priests: Role of Brahmā**

Both Śākhās differ from each other with respect to the priests to be employed 

in the various domestic rituals. The Śaunaka Śākhā prescribes the main priest 

\( kartā\) and Brahmā in principle.24 According to the KarmP, there are four priests in the Paippalāda tradition of Odisha; they carry out the sacrificial performance \( karmavāhaka\). One of them is the main priest \( kartā\) and the other three are the members \( sadasya\) or associates. These priests are: Kartā, Brahmā, Hotā and **21** The text was published by Śrī Vedagīrvāṇapāṭhaśālā, Ahmedabad. For more details see Bahulkar 1977: 214–215; 2002b. In recent years, the first Prakāśa was published by M. Bala Krishna Reddy whom I had helped to obtain a copy of the manuscript. Unfortunately, the edition is worthless; it is full of misprints, absence of spaces between the words, and makes no sense. See Reddy 2012. 

**22** The edition brought out by Paṇḍā \(2000\) cannot be accepted as a critical one. As Sumant informs me, it appears to be his own “Prayoga” based on the Karmasamuccaya \[personal communication\]. 

**23** vivāho garbhakaraṇaṃ tataḥ puṃsavanaṃ punaḥ | jātakarma ca godānopanayanāplavanānīti 

|| \(KarmP, p. 3\). 

**24** See footnote 8 above. 

The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda Śākhās of the Atharvaveda  

[[357]]

Yājaka.25 This description of the four priests is perhaps modelled on the Śrauta 

sacrifices where there are four main priests, namely, the Adhvaryu, the Hotā, the Udgātā and the Brahmā. The four priests mentioned by Paiṭhīnasi carry out specific functions that are different from those of the priests in the Śrauta sacrifices. 

The KarmP quotes Paiṭhīnasi,26 according to whom the main priest is called Kartā 

because he performs all major acts. The second priest procures the substances 

required for the performance of the sacrifice. The third priest responds to the call of the main priest and the fourth makes a decision on the mantras to be employed 

in the ritual.27

**5  Time and Place of the Performance **

**in the Śaunaka Tradition**

In the introduction to his commentary, Sāyaṇa explains the time and the place of 

the performance:

These rites are to be performed outside the community \(i.e., in the forest\), to the east or the north, on the other bank of a big river, a deep pool and so on \[. . .\]. According to the opinion of the commentator, Rudra, the performance of the obligatory rites such as Puṃsavana and so on is to be done at home only. The time of the performance is the time of the two Parvan days, \(i.e., the full moon or the new moon days,\) or any other lunar day with an auspicious constellation. The time for the rite for the pacification of the omens and portents is immediately after the respective event takes place. The rites of sorcery are to be performed to the south of the community, on the dark half of the month, under the constellation Pleiades \( kṛttikāḥ\). In respect of these rites, the constituents \( aṅgāni\) related to the \(directions, namely,\) the east and the north are to be performed in the manner of \(the constituents\) of the Darśapūrṇamāsa.28

**6  Time and Place of Performance **

**in the Paippalāda Tradition**

According to the tradition of the Paippalādins in Odisha, as reflected in the KarmP, there is no specific mention of the day and the time of the performance. We also do not find terms such as Ājyatantra, Pākatantra, or Darśapūrṇamāsa. The frequently 

used expression is pākayajñikaṃ tantram, the expression commonly used by the KauS and other Gṛhya Sūtras as well.29 The day of the performance can be any 

auspicious day. As usual, at the time of the Saṃkalpa, the priest would mention the day following the usual Hindu way, irrespective of the Vedic Śākhās. This Saṃkalpa mentioned in the KarmP is related to the rite of Kanyādāna in the wedding ceremony but is a common one for all the rites. 

Then, in the second half \(i.e., fifty years\) of \(the hundred years of the total life of\) Brahmā, in the aeon of the White Boar, on the twenty-eighth year \(i.e., mahāyuga\) of \(the seventh\) Manu, the son of Vivasvān, in the first quarter of the Kali Age of the Four Ages, in the 4,691st year, in the year \(called by the\) name XXX, during the period of the journey of the sun \( ayana\) XXX, in the season XXX, in the month of XXX, in the XXX half of the month, on the lunar day XXX, under the constellation XXX; when the sun is dwelling in the zodiac sign XXX; when the moon is dwelling in the zodiac sign XXX; thus, when the planets, Mars and others, are dwelling in their respective places of the zodiac signs; with the Yoga, Lagna, Karaṇa, Muhūrta and Aṃśas; on \(this\) auspicious day, on \(this\) auspicious lunar day, marked by such and such kind of characteristics; here on the earth, in the Jambudvīpa, in the Bharata continent of the region of the Bharatas, in the country of Utkala, to the south of Meru mountain, to the north of Great Ocean, in the intermediate region between Śrī Virajā and Puruṣottama, in the vicinity of the feet of gods and Brahmins, I, belonging to the gotra XXX, having the name XXX, intend to give my daughter away \(as a bride to the groom\). This is the resolve.30

The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda Śākhās of the Atharvaveda  

[[359]]

On the contrary, the Saṃkalpa of the Śaunakīyas in Gujarat is brief:

Here, today, in the month of XXX, in the XXX half of the month, on \(this\) lunar day XXX, on the day XXX, on the lunar day,31 in order to obtain, for my own \(benefit\), the fruits \(i.e. merit\) mentioned in the Śruti, the Smṛti and the Purāṇas, or with the permission of the sacrificer \(?\), I shall perform the rite called Sthālīpāka as a part of the rite XXX, Upanayana and so on, along with \(the performance of\) the Grahamakha.32

The word vā- in this Saṃkalpa, denoting an option, is significant. Generally, the resolve is to be made by the sacrificer, repeating the words after the priest. However, it may not be possible for the sacrificer to do that. In that case, the priest recites the resolve on behalf of the sacrificer, with his permission. 

As regards the place of the ritualistic performance, there is a considerable difference between the traditions of the two Śākhās. We have seen that the Śaunaka tradition prescribes certain places outside the home for various rituals except for the Jātakarman and so on that have to be performed at home. The Paippalāda tradition prescribes a rather unique venue. They do not go to the banks of a river or a forest, nor do they perform the rituals at home. For that purpose, they have a rite of constructing a special hall outside the house. The rite is called bahiḥśālāropaṇavidhi \(KarmP, p. 2–10\). This is recommended for all rituals \( sarvakarme praśasyate, KarmP, p. 2\). The KarmP says: jātasaṃsthāyāṃ bahiḥśālāropaṇam avaśyaṃ kāryam | gṛhādeḥ

karmācaraṇe niṣiddhatvāt | yathoktaṃ paribhāṣāyām –

gṛhamadhye na kartavyā jātasaṃsthā kadācana |

prāṅgaṇe maṇḍapaṃ kṛtvā tatra karma samārabhet || 

\(KarmP, p. 2–3\).33

In respect of the Jātasaṃsthā, one should invariably carry out the construction of the out-house, because it is prohibited to perform the act in the house and other places. As it is said in the Paribhāṣā –

‘One should never perform the Jātasaṃsthā in the house. Having constructed a pandal in the courtyard, one should commence the performance.’

**7 Ājyatantra and Pākatantra**

The basic domestic ritual of the Atharvavedins is variously called Gṛhya 

Darśapūrṇamāsa, Pākayajña,34 Sthālīpāka,35 Pārvaṇa Sthālīpāka36 and Kuśaṇḍikā.37 

The rite has two varieties, namely, Ājyatantra38 and Pākatantra. The rite where 

there are oblations of clarified butter \( ājya\) is called Ājyatantra, while the Pākatantra involves the oblations of cooked rice \( caru\), sacrificial bread \( puroḍāśa\) and so on.39 This is the main offering \( pradhāna-homa\). The ritual is divided into two parts, namely, the Pūrvatantra and the Uttaratantra. The main rite takes place after the Pūrvatantra is over and before the Uttaratantra begins. 

There are some more differences between these two varieties. KauS \(1.6\[6\].34\) 

quotes a verse that says that the Pūrvatantra ends with the Ājyabhāga offerings 

\( ājyabhāgāntaṃ prāktantram\). However, this applies only to the Ājyatantra. The Pākatantra does not have these offerings. This is explained by Keśava: pākatantre abhyātānāni na bhavanti \(KP, p. 468\). See also Sāyaṇa’s introduction, where he 

quotes Keśava: yad āha keśavaḥ – ‘pākatantreṣv abhyātānāni na bhavanti \[. . .\]’\) 

\(Vishva Bandhu 1960: 28\). The rite called Abhyātāna offerings is performed at 

the end of the Pūrvatantra and at the beginning of the Uttaratantra. After the 

Abhyātāna offerings in the Pūrvatantra are made, the Pradhāna karma takes place 

and the Uttaratantra begins again with the Abhyātāna offerings. 

Caland has given the order of the constituents of the ritual in the introduction 

to his Altindisches Zauberritual.40 The basis of this order is Sāyaṇa’s introduction to his commentary on the AVŚ \(Vishva Bandhu 1960: 28\), where Sāyaṇa provides a 

list of various acts to be performed in the Darśapūrṇamāsa, probably following the list given by Keśava in his Paddhati, at the end of his comment on KauS 1.6\[6\].37 

\(KP, p. 22\). One may observe that none of the two lists is comprehensive. I have 

therefore modified the order to a certain extent on the basis of the description of the two parts of the Darśapūrṇamāsa, and a comparative study of the lists offered by Keśava and Sāyaṇa.

A reference to the priestly manual from Gujarat, namely the Atharvavedaprayo-

gabhānu, has already been made above. This Prayoga adds some basic rites that are common to all such rituals. \(Sthālīpākaprayogaraśmi, Prakāśa I, Raśmi 18,

Avyasaś ca \(AVŚ 19.68.1\)

After this, the order of the rites in the Darśapūrṇamāsa is similar to that given by Sāyaṇa on the basis of KauS 1.1–6 \[1–6\] and 14.1\[137\], cited above. In addition to those rites, the rite ends with the declaration of the end of the performance:

The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda Śākhās of the Atharvaveda  

[[363]]

atrādya amukakarmaṇi sthālīpākākhyaṃ karma kṛtasya vidheḥ sarvaṃ paripūrṇam astu |

Here, today, in the rite \(called\) xxx41 let all \(the constituents\) of the rite called Sthālīpāka be complete.42

There then follows the muttering of the Śāntisūkta which is not specified there. 

The end of the performance is marked by the usual statement: kṛtaṃ karmeśvarār-

paṇaṃ kuryāt “One should dedicate the performance to God” \(Sthālīpākaprayoga-

raśmi, Prakāśa I, Raśmi 18, fol. 77b\). 

The author provides some additional information about the procedure of the 

selection of the Brahmā priest. He mentions that the selection should be made with the recitation of the mantra oṃ yaja tatra tvam \(fol. 68a, line 3\). This appears to be a call to the Brahmā. The KP however quotes a pratīka of a different mantra to be recited on this occasion: bhūpate iti brahmavaraṇam \(KP on KauS 1.2\[2\].18, p. 8\); also, bhūpate iti brahmavaraṇavidhānena varaṇam \(KP on KauS 14.1\[137\].33, 

p. 467\). The procedure of selecting the Brahmā priest is laid down in the VaitS 

\(1.17–18\). Dārila too provides the same information, referring to the same text: atra brahmavaraṇam vitānavat | vṛtajapaś ca bhavati | vṛto japati iti vitānavacanāt | 

ahaṃ bhūpatiḥ iti \(DB on KauS 1.2\[2\].18, p. 19, lines 2–3\). This method is called atideśa “extension”. Generally, there are a number of basic acts that are mentioned in the KauS and are referred to by the VaitS; but in this case, the commentators refer to the latter as this is not mentioned in the KauS but is necessary 

to use in the rite of the selection of the Brahmā. As said before, the role of the Brahmā is optional. Therefore, this rite from the VaitS is to be performed only 

symbolically. 

**8 Pūrvatantra and Uttaratantra in the KarmP**

The editors of the KarmP have given the section titles and other elements of con-

tents, as much as possible, based on Śrīdhara’s own usage and at times have for-

mulated their own designations \(p. 163–172\). While describing the Pūrvatantra, 

Śṛīdhara says that there are eight Pākayajñas mentioned in the Śruti. They are:

sāyaṃprātarhomau sthālīpāko navaś ca yaḥ |

baliś ca pitṛyajñāś ca aṣṭakāś caiva saptamāḥ |

**41** The word amuka- literally means ‘such and such \(by name\)’. The word is to be substituted by the name \(of the rite or the sacrificer or something else, as the case may be\). This substitution is called ūha ‘modification’ \(Gode & Karve 1957, sub voce\). 

**42** This is what is meant by the Sanskrit sentence written in the typically priestly style. 

**364** 

Shrikant Bahulkar

paśur ity ete pākayajñā iti | aṣṭamaḥ pākayajñāś ca ity ete pākayajñāḥ |

\(KarmP, p. 50\)

The morning and the evening offerings, the Sthālīpāka, \(the offering of\) new \(corn?\),43 the Bali, Pitṛyajñas, and the Aṣṭakās – these seven, \(and\) the animal sacrifice – the eighth, these are the Pākayajñas.44

All these Pākayajñas follow the basic ritual of the Pūrvatantra and the Uttaratantra. 

For these rites, the Paippalāda Śākhā has four tantras, i.e., “models”, called Divya, Sāmpada, Prāyaścitta and Ābhicārika. The Paribhāṣā explains the purpose of performing these four types of tantras:

catvāraḥ karmaṇām ete bhavanty atra vicārakāḥ |

divyāś ca sāmpadāś caiva prāyaścittābhicārikāḥ |

eteṣāṃ karmabhedam āha –

svargādisādhane divyān sāmpadān kāmyasādhane |

aihikāmuṣmikacchidre prāyaścittān prayojayet |

uddṛptavairināśāya yojayed ābhicārikān iti || 

\(KarmP, p. 96\)

They consider these four rites, namely, the divine rites \( divya\), the rites for prosperity \( sāmpada\), the expiation rites \( prāyaścitta\) and the sorcery rites \( ābhicārika\). One should employ the divine rites in order to obtain heaven and so on, the rites for prosperity to obtain the fulfilment of various desires, the expiation in the case of a ‘hole’, i.e., sin while performing the acts for mundane and super-mundane aims, and in order to destroy an angry enemy, one should employ the sorcery rites. 

Griffiths and Sumant observe:

Besides these, the Paippalāda Śākhā knows an option of choosing one further model that combines the first three, and this combined performance of the divya, the sāmpada and the prāyaścittīya tantras is known as the samuccayatantra. It is this samuccayatantra which is actually performed in all domestic rituals of the Paippalādins today, and the same seems to have been true in Śrīdhara’s time. \(KarmP, Intro., p. lxviii\). 

As regards the selection of the priests, the Paippalāda has a special procedure. As mentioned before, they employ four priests for the performance, namely, Kartā, 

Brhamā, Hotā and Yājaka. \(KarmP, p. 19\). First, they select the Hotā \(KarmP, 25–26\). 

**43** Cf. Patyal 1969: 185. 

**44** The editors point out in their introduction \(cxxiv\) that the text is seriously corrupt; however, they have chosen to retain the text as found in the manuscripts. The passage corresponds to the Gopathabrāhmaṇa 1.5.23, where the statement enumerates seven Pākayajñas. Cf. Gautama Dharma Sutra 1.8.19 \(Pandeya 1966: 74\). The translation of the passage, given above, is not a literal one. A possible emendation of the last two sentences could be: \[. . .\] paśur ity aṣṭamaḥ | ity ete pākayajñā ity ete pākayajñā iti. The repetition of the words ity ete pākayajñāḥ might denote the end of a chapter. This kind of repetition, denoting the end of a chapter, is found elsewhere, e.g. śaṃ mayi jānīdhvaṃ śaṃ mayi jānīdhvam | ĀśGṛS 2.10.8. 

The Śaunaka and the Paippalāda Śākhās of the Atharvaveda  

[[365]]

The procedure is similar to that of the Śaunaka using the mantra from the VaitS 

1.17–18 \(Garbe 1982: 2\). It is quite a common phenomenon that the sacrificer, not being familiar with Sanskrit, would not be able to recite the mantra. In that case, some other Brahmin touches the Kartā and mutters the mantra:

yadā yajamāno vedasyāsāmarthyāt tadā anyaṃ brāhmaṇaṃ \(sic\)

tatpratinidhitvena kartāraṃ spṛṣṭvā mantraṃ japati | 

\(KarmP, p. 26\). 

When the sacrificer \(cannot recite the mantra\) due to \(his\) inability \(to recite\) the Veda, then another Brahmin, as his \(i.e. the sacrificer’s\) substitute, touches the performer and mutters the mantra. 

This is not unusual, other Vedic Śākhās having the same problem due to igno-

rance on part of the sacrificers. After the selection of the Hotā, the selection of the Brahmā, the Dravyopakalpaka, the Pṛṣṭaprativaktā and the Mantraniścāyaka is 

done. While doing so, the word hotā is to be substituted with brahmā and so on.45 

The same set of mantras is to be employed with the necessary modifications. This is a unique feature of the Paippalādins. If it is not possible to get all four priests, only two, namely the Ṛtvig and the Brahmā are selected. Still, there is one more option: one may select the Ṛtvig alone and in the place of Brahmā, a water jar is placed. 

This is in common with the Śaunaka as well as the Śākhās of other Vedas.46 Even if it is difficult to find one priest who would play the role of the Ṛtvig, the sacrificer himself should act as Kartā. 

ācāryaṃ varayet pūrvaṃ brahmāṇaṃ tadanantaram |

athavā ṛtviṅmātraṃ varaṇīyam | brahmā punar udapātram | evaṃ trividhā brāhmaṇavy-

avasthā | athavā ṛtvigabhāve svayaṃ yajamānaḥ kartā vā syāt | 

\(KarmP, p. 28\). 

One should first select the Ācārya \(i. e. Kartā\), then \(one should select\) the Brahmā. Alternatively, \(one should select\) \(one\) priest only. In that case, a water-jar \(should be placed as\) the Brahmā. Thus \(there could be\) threefold arrangement of Brahmins. Alternatively, when \(even a single\) priest is not available, the sacrificer himself may optionally be the performer. 

We have already seen that in the tradition of the Śaunaka, the rite called Abhyātāna offerings is performed at the end of the Pūrvatantra and at the beginning of the 

Uttaratantra. These offerings are not mentioned in the KarmP, at least in the part published so far. The text called Paippalāda-vivāhādi-saṃskārapaddhati, edited by Paṇḍā, mentions the Abhyātāna mantras. They are the same as those found in the

AVŚ. However, the rite takes place after the marriage ceremony, before the Catur-

thikākarman and not as the rite prefixed and suffixed to the Pradhāna offerings. 

At present, it is not possible to find out the basis of this rite mentioned by Paṇḍā. 

**9 Comparative Study of the Rituals**

As mentioned in the beginning, the present article attempts to make a comparative study of the basic ritual of the domestic Darśapūrṇamāsa described in the relevant texts in the Śaunaka and the Paippalāda traditions. It will be important to make a further study of various rituals of both the Śākhās.47

**10 Concluding Remarks**

In connection with the performance of the basic ritual of the Pākayajñas, there 

are some noteworthy differences between the two Śākhās. The Prayogas in the 

Śaunaka tradition are based mainly on the KauS. Although they change the order 

of the sūtras for the actual performance, some of them actually quote the sūtras 

and explain them. For example, the Prayogadīpa of Devabhadra specifically says 

that it is not a common practice to compose the Prayoga by quoting the sūtras; 

however, the author of the Prayogadīpa does that.48 The Prayogas also enlist the 

help of the commentaries on the KauS. Thus, the exegetical tradition of the Śaunaka is well established. On the contrary, the Paippalādins do not have a Gṛhyasūtra. 

They might be aware of the KauS but they do not have a tradition of studying that text. There is a work called Prapañcahṛdaya, composed in Kerala. The author and 

the date of the work are not known.49 It mentions that there existed a Śrautasūtra in the Paippalāda Śākhā, ascribed to Agastya, but the information cannot be accepted as valid.50 Veṅkaṭamādhava, the author of the Ṛgvedānukramaṇī, mentions that 

**47** For recent attempts in this regard, see Sumant 2013 and 2022. 

**48** For details, see Bahulkar 1978: 33. 

**49** In this connection, Bronkhorst remarks: “It is hard to determine with certainty the extent to which the accounts of the Prapañcahṛdaya are trustworthy.” \(2007: 294\). He also points out that it is a relatively recent text, dating roughly from the time of Yāmuna and Rāmānuja.” \(2007: 297, n. 44\). 

Also, see 2007: 292, n. 30. Witzel thinks that it was probably composed in the south of India, maybe in the 11th century \(2020: 764\).

portion of the Introduction, Pandit \(1880: 423\) lists the four Śākhās, namely, the Śaunakīyās, the Ākshalās \(? Jājalas\), the Jaladās \(? Jaladas\) and the Brahmavādās \(? 

Brahmavadas\). Cf. Bloomfield 1972: xxxiv–xxxv; Whitney 1893: 89. I have argued 

in one of my papers that historically those four Śākhās could be the Śaunaka, the Paippalāda, the Jājala and the Cāraṇavaidya.52 However, the statement about the 

KauS being the Sūtra for the four Śākhās need not be taken literally. It simply indicates that there existed four Śākhās of the AV and that the followers of the other three Śākhās began to study and follow the Śaunaka. In Gujarat, there were some 

Atharvavedins who claimed that they belonged to the Paippalāda but followed the 

Śaunaka. In Odisha, however, the Atharvavedins followed their own Śākhā and 

performed the ritual according to the priestly manuals. Those priestly manuals frequently mention Paiṭhīnasi as the source of their explanation. However, the Paiṭhīnasi Sūtra or the Paiṭhīnasi Smṛti is available only in the form of the citations from that work found in some works in the tradition of the AV and various works on 

Dharmaśāstra.53

The two traditions, the Śaunaka and the Paippalāda, also differ from each 

other in many respects. Although the rituals at the root could be the same, the traditions have diverged from each other in the course of time. The influence of local traditions is noteworthy. The followers of the Gujarat tradition of the Śaunaka are the Nāgara Brahmins who belong to all the four Vedic Śākhās, namely, the Ṛgveda – 

mainly Śāṅkhāyana Sūtra, the Śukla Yajurveda – the Mādhyandina, the Kauthuma 

Śākha of Sāmaveda and the Śaunaka Śākhā of the AV.54 It is possible that there were some Paippalādins in Gujarat who were assimilated with the Śaunaka in the course 

of time. They have common deities and have common rituals that are also men-

tioned in the Prayogas of that Śākhā. In the case of the Paippalādins in Odisha, they have some unique rites. For instance, they establish a hall outside the house for the performance of the rites \( bahiḥśālāśubhavidhi, KarmP, p. 1–10\). At the outset, they **51**  aitareyakam asmākaṃ paippalādam atharvaṇām | Ṛgvedānukramaṇī, 8.1.13ab; Vidyāvāridhi 1979: 288.

worship ten deities, namely, Mita, Pramita, and so on \( mitādipūjā\).55 It is possible to cite many more examples of such deviations. A further, detailed and systematic study comparing the ritualistic traditions of the two Śākhās is yet to be done.

**The Textual Divisions and the Conventions **

**mantrādhikāra**** and phalādhikāra**** **

**in Classifying the Rites in the Kauśika **

**Sūtra****: A Case Study of the Construction Rites**

**Abstract:** It is commonly considered that the Kauśika Sūtra prescribes two rites accompanying the building of a house, in two different chapters. This study reconstructs the two rites with the help of the two medieval commentaries of Dārila 

and Keśava, an unedited late paddhati commentary \( Atharvaṇīya Paddhati\), and a prayoga manual for ritual performance \( Samskāraratnaprayoga\), further arguing that only one is a proper construction rite. As a prerequisite for the elucidation of the idiosyncratic ritual, the paper deals with the textual intricacies of the KauśS: textual divisions of the surrounding context, the two methods used by Kauśika 

to arrange the subjects of the sūtra text, the so called mantrādhikāra and phalādhikāra, etc. The paper shows that these devices are used as conventions indicating which procedures to perform first in order to understand the sūtra text and in the case in question, to classify the construction rites. In comparison with a similar rite construed around worshiping the Lord of the house, found in the rituals of the other Vedic schools, the Atharvavedins had a complex ceremony completed by the 

worshiping of Vāstoṣpati which includes two mantras that are found in the Paip-

palāda Saṁhitā \(PS\) 7.6.10 and 20.23.2, quoted in full by the KauśS and considered as kalpajā ṛcs “verses issued from the ritual” by Śaunakin ritual texts. The whole hymn PS 7.6 is employed by a Paippalādic ritual text in a ceremony connected with purification of the construction site. The two verses are found with minor variants as ṚV 7.54.1 and 7.55.1, and are appropriately employed by the ritual texts of other Vedic schools. 

**Acknowledgements:** I thank very much the organisers of the conference “The Atharvaveda and its South Asian Contexts” at the University of Zurich for inviting me to contribute to the discussion. I am indebted to Robert Leach and Oliver Hellwig for their careful reading of my manuscript. This article is a tribute to guruji S.S. Bahulkar who has taught me how to read the Kauśika Sūtra.
