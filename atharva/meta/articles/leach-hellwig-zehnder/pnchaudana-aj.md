**What Does the páñcaudana- ajá-**** Represent **

**in the Śaunakīya****- and Paippalāda****- Saṁhitā****s? **

**A Tentative Reading through the Lens of **

**Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa**** II 53–54**

**Abstract:** The phrase páñcaudana- ajá-  mentioned in ŚS IV 14 and IX 5 and PS III 38, VIII 19, XVI 97–100 denotes a billy-goat offered with five portions of mashed rice, in the context of a sacrifice aimed at gaining access to heaven. Nonetheless, several details, such as the syntagms jyótis tṛtī́ya in ŚS IX 5.11 and PS XVI 97.8 or aparimita- yajña-  in ŚS IX 5.22 and PS XVI 99.8, refer to a permanent deathless state, which surpasses the impermanence of the stay in heaven commonly obtained by means of a sacrifice performed with the help of an officiant priest. 

On the basis of a lexically grounded comparison with other Vedic sources, I 

postulate that this billy-goat might have originally represented the psychophysi-

cal self with its five sense organs, which has to merge the body entirely made of light, arisen from the sacrifices performed during one’s life and stored in heaven, until the death of the sacrificer. In particular, a later, definitely less poetic but more explicit and systematic version of this eschatological theory seems to be taught in JB II 53–54 by the controversial figure of Keśin Dārbhya. It is the doctrine of the so-called “non-decay of what is granted by sacrifices” \( iṣṭapūrtá\), in which the individual faculties, offered during the sacrifice instead of other oblations, can reach the relevant gods \(and the relevant divine worlds\) and finally be “redeemed”, so 

that the sacrificer is able to permanently enjoy merit in heaven.

The present article is focused on a single phrase selected from a few dozen Atharvaveda verses, but it stems from the more general purpose of testing single passages or whole hymns of this Saṁhitā in order to ascertain whether they could be read as soteriological in intent. Scholars have often preferred to focus on the ritual side of **Note:** All translations from Vedic and Sanskrit are the author’s, unless explicitly stated.

most Atharvaveda hymns, e.g. emphasising how “\[o\]ur general experience with the 

Atharva Veda leads us to expect in the first instance an exorcistic purpose, a ‘blessing’ or a ‘curse,’ in any composition found in it.”1 Even the recent reinterpretation of the late inclusion of the Atharvaveda in the Vedic Canon as a consequence of the complex and successful schedule of Brahmins “reinventing themselves” according 

to Bronkhorst’s hypothesis \(2016\) relies on the importance of the “magical formu-

las” collected in this work. In fact these formulas “made it possible for Brahmins to exert their powers even in hostile situations, in circumstances where the support of the ruling classes was not guaranteed or worse” \(Bronkhorst 2016: 225\). However, 

as Edgerton already noticed \(1920: 118\), this attitude among scholars depends on 

the importance the renowned Kauśikasūtras assumed in the later Atharvavedic tradition. Even if the Atharvaveda contains numerous texts dedicated to ritual 

actions aimed at achieving specific worldly goals, this should not prevent us from appreciating their relevant soteriological contents.2

For instance, it is quite possible that the paryāya-sūkta ŚS VIII 10 which is explicitly devoted to praising the well-known Vedic metre consisting of four pāda s of ten syllables each called virāj, actually took the social dimension of the main actors in sacrifices into account. This dimension was considered within a heroic 

perspective rather than being simply related to this concrete metre and more gen-

erally to the actual events on the ritual scene. In fact, virāj  is also a noun denoting pre-eminence, and often the highest rank for a man \(that is for the leader\), so that the leader’s prestige, more than the homonymous metre, might have actually 

moved up and down within the sacrificial arena, as Candotti, Neri & Pontillo \(2020: 142–143\) advanced in their comment on ŚS VIII 10.4.3

This is definitely not the first time that the possible importance of soteriological contents of the Atharvaveda in their early conception has been taken into account: already at the beginning of the last century, Paul Deussen \(1906: 209\)4 remarked 

on the need for a monographic study specifically dedicated to Atharvaveda’s spec-

ulative viewpoints, and Edgerton \(1920: 117\) maintained: “It is probably true that the Atharvaveda contains more matter which can be called ‘philosophic’ than any 

**1** Edgerton 1920: 118. 

**2** With an intriguing hypothesis, only partly inspired by Gonda \(1975: 292\), Frank Köhler argues conversely in a forthcoming article that “these speculations should function as a theoretical foundation” for the main contents of the Atharvaveda texts, i.e. the spells. Many thanks to F. Köhler for allowing me to read a preliminary version of this article.

other Saṁhitā. Certainly it contains a great deal more of such matter than the Rig Veda.” We know in fact that, on the one hand, some presumably solemn theological 

hymns, e.g. “the noble hymn to Varuṇa \(IV 16\)”, turn out instead to be “a witchcraft charm, betraying its final purpose in the gross curse at the end – in cauda venenum” 

\(Bloomfield 1899: 87\).5 On the other hand, it is plausible that some hymns considered to be charms might also have been based on some more complex concepts of 

a soteriological nature which were founded on a sapiential and heroic tradition 

and overtly explained in other passages in the Atharvaveda Saṁhitā or elsewhere. 

Shende \(1985: 190\) also suggested that the Atharvavedic ritual performances had a double purpose, the second of which is indisputably grounded in soteriology: “Not only did the Atharvaṇic priests employ sacrifice for the sake of magic to secure 

worldly ends, but also they employed it for securing the heaven.”6 A promise of 

some extremely practical reward, such as wealth and success in daily life, is commonly found at the end of most Atharvaveda hymns, but let us not forget that this reward is exclusively obtained by the ‘initiate’ who possesses a given knowledge 

\( yo evaṃ veda\). 

Now, one might wonder what the original primary purpose of the Athar-

vaveda was, i.e. whether the soteriological doctrines derived secondarily from 

some incidental reflections on concrete ritual details or if conversely this Saṁhitā 

tradition was only later associated with ritual performances.7 With regard to the Vaitānasūtras, Edgerton \(1929: 157\) wrote that “the application of most of Atharvaveda hymns to the Śrauta sphere was entirely a secondary matter”. Today, if we 

accept the very interesting perspective recently outlined by Geslani \(2018\), namely that the king’s legitimisation and the cyclic empowerment ceremonies of his reign are at the core of the Atharvaveda texts, we could still go a step further and assume that the expressly ritual garb in which the Atharvaveda tradition has been handed **5** ŚS IV 16.7: śaténa pā́śair abhí dhehi varuṇainaṃ mā́ te mocy anṛtavā́ṅ nṛcakṣaḥ | ā́stāṃ jālmá udáraṃ śraṃśayitvā́ kóśa ivābandháḥ parikṛtyámānaḥ | “With a hundred fetters, O Varuṇa, subdue him, let not the speaker of untruth escape you, o men-watcher\! Let the villain sit letting his belly fall \[apart\], like a hoopless vessel, being cut round about.” \(tr. Whitney & Lanman 1905 vol. 

1: 178, slightly modified: “subdue him” instead of “do thou bridle him”; “you” instead of “thee”\). 

**6** This is in line with Bloomfield \(1899: 87\), who considers that “Every animal offered as dakṣiṇā 

represents both itself and a cosmic power of the first rank: the gift of a goat, aja introduces Aja Ekapād with his mystic punning attribute \[. . .\].” 

**7** Cf. Edgerton \(1920: 122\): “But now arises the question, what do we mean by ‘secondary’ employment? Do we mean that the ritualists have lost the thread of true Atharvan tradition, and use these hymns in a way different from that intended by their Atharvan compilers? \[. . .\] Even when to our minds a hymn seems to deal purely with ‘higher thought’, can we be sure that lower or more practical motives were absent from the mind of its original composer, not to speak of him who included it in the Atharvan collection?”.

down to us might have been a consequence of a later reworking of the Atharvaveda 

literature. We could thus restore a position once expressed by Gonda \(see in par-

ticular 1965: 18\) for whom the time when complex Vedic sacrifices were dramati-

cally replaced by simple dakṣiṇā s depicted as Savayajñas \(i.e. by the performance of mere symbolic offerings of the sacrifice of Soma\) only came about during the 

Kauśikasūtra phase.8

Nevertheless we could reinterpret this supposed substitution and simplifica-

tion of ritual actions not as something that came out of the blue, but rather as a re-emergence from the past of an even earlier tradition, namely that of the sattra- culture, as reconstructed by Falk \(1985; 1986: 37–40\). Among the distinctive features of the sattra I especially refer to the lack of separation between the role of officiant and patron in the sacrificial arena and to the consequent absence of a genuine “priestly gift” \( dakṣiṇā\). Indeed Falk points out that the sacrificers present themselves, i.e. their ātman, as dakṣiṇā, as explained in TS 7,4.9 and KB 15,1.23–26, and argues that a heroic self-immolation might have been part of the early sattra.  9 

The assumed simplification of the ritual actions as a revival of an ancient tradition probably occurred only after the Atharvaveda branch had acquired an obvious 

degree of centrality that would previously have been inconceivable in view of the long period it spent in the margins of orthodoxy. Sacrifices in such a simplified context were presumably basic but competitive. What mattered most was their 

meaning rather than the highly technical performance and hieratic ritualism of 

the sacrificial actions, found instead in the Yajurveda and the Kalpasūtras. And if this reconstructive hypothesis were correct, then we might also understand why 

the so-called dakṣiṇā- or sava-hymns appear to originally be the most “notable medium” for what Bloomfield \(1899: 86–87\) defined as the Atharvaveda’s “speculation”,10 precisely because more attention was paid to the meaning of ceremonies than to their technical details. My proposal is that the Atharvavedic ritual perfor-8 “In the first place the whole procedure is simplified. They can be performed by an average man. 

Secondly, they are equally effective. They are thus superior to the Vedic sacrifices such as Agnisto-ma etc. \[. . .\] styled as ‘ sava s’ perhaps because they are symbolical of the Soma sacrifice.” \(Shende 1985: 190\). See Gonda \(1965: 19\) on Atharvavedic sources in general: “It is, if I am not mistaken, sometimes – or, at first sight – very difficult to make out whether the victims or objects regarded as 

‘victims’ mentioned in these rites are primarily presented as ‘offerings’ or as ‘gifts’.” 

**9** As for a study of the Vedic phrase ātmádakṣiṇam sattrám, see Pontillo 2023. 

**10** See also the following statement \(Bloomfield 1899: 86\): “The presence in the Atharvaveda of a considerable number of cosmogonic-theosophic hymns, marking in a way the extreme distance from the ordinary witchcraft-formula, is not readily explained. The common village-practitioner is not likely to have had much use for them, and even the puróhita in his ordinary offices \[. . .\]. 

But it would be a mistake to suppose that theosophic speculation is foreign to the Atharvan, and inorganic; or that all hymns of this sort are loosely attached to the main body of its compositions.

[[161]]

mances which are often nothing more than simple offerings in the  Kauśikasūtra s11 

might have been accompanied by reflection on the attainable permanent human 

immortality that is the core of some Atharvaveda hymns and is found later in 

Sāmavedic Brahmanas and in early Upaniṣads. Bearing in mind this proposal, the 

present paper aims to inquire into the nature of the imagery proposed in a couple of alleged offerings that Shende \(1985: 194–196\) called ajaudanasava and pañcau-danasava in ŚS IV 14 and in ŚS IX 5 respectively. Indeed the two names could be used at the same time for both hymns. In fact, on the one hand, in ŚS IV 14 the 

ajá- \(mentioned 3 times in this hymn\) is not generically supplemented by dishes of mashed rice \( odaná-\), but is precisely páñcaudana-, i.e. supplemented by five dishes of mashed rice \(or by five balls of cooked rice, according to Shende 1985: 194\). On the other hand, in ŚS IX 5, where the stem páñcaudana- occurs 19 times, the word ajá- also occurs 26 times. Thus, the same kind of performance might have been the focus of both these mentioned Śaunakīya-Saṁhitā hymns, several verses of which 

also match with portions of six Paippalāda-Saṁhitā hymns, namely PS III 38, VIII 

19 and XVI 97–100. 

The research question of the present work is: are these texts inspired by a 

first-hand experience of the sacred rather than being mediated by a priest? This 

question stems from the fact that several details of these passages involving the phrase páñcaudana- ajá-  refer to access to heaven and in a specific way to a permanent deathless state, which surpasses the impermanence of the stay in heaven 

commonly obtained by means of a sacrifice performed with the help of an officiant priest.

In line with the aforementioned simplification, the main ritual action here is also very simple. It is explained in the following verse and a half, which is almost identical in both recensions, where verse ŚS IV 14.6 is a close match for PS III 38.5, and ŚS IV 14.7ab, for PS XVI 98 10ab respectively \(Table 2\).13

five portions. 

I have translated the accusative páñcaudanaṃ  in this passage as a bahuvrīhi conveying the sense “endowed with five portions of mashed rice” referring to the ajá-mentioned in the previous verse, because of the accent that complies with rule 

Aṣṭādhyāyī VI 2.1 \(the first constituent retains its original accent in the bahuvrīhi\).14 

**13** Henceforth the underlining serves to highlight the most important differences between the two recensions, compared in two parallel columns. When the PS recension is significantly different, it is also translated in the rightmost column. 

**14** According to Aṣṭādhyāyī II 1.51–52 a dvigu  can be used when the sense conveyed is that of a taddhita  affix, of a subsequent constituent \( uttarapada\) or of a collective noun \(the so-called  samāhāra dvigu\). If it were a singular neuter samāhāra \(i.e. a neuter singular compound, as is taught in Aṣṭādhyāyī II 4.1, 17\), conveying the sense of “group of five portions of mashed rice”, it should have a final pitch, in accordance with the general rule for compound accentuation Aṣṭādhyāyī  VI 1.223 

\(because the exceptions VI 2.29–31 do not apply to our case\), while páñcaudanaṃ has the initial vowel pitched \(see also Whitney 18992: 505, 512\). On the other hand, the meaning of a taddhita, e.g. 

**164** 

Tiziana Pontillo

Within a bloodless sacrificial context, this compound might also have conveyed the sense of a substitute for the billy-goat, i.e. “\[a billy-goat actually\] made of five portions of mashed rice”. Nonetheless, here an effective chiasmus seems to be realised by the two instrumental cases \(denoting 5 items and 1 item respectively\) and the two accusative cases \( vice versa denoting 1 and 5 items respectively\). On the one hand, a single agent of the verb dhṛ- “to take up” \( dárvyā “by means of the ladle”\) is linked to a fivefold object \(i.e. pañcaitám odanám “that mashed rice which is divided into five portions”\). On the other, five agents \( aṅgúlibhiḥ “by means of the five fingers”\) are presumably linked to a single object, i.e. to the billy-goat \(mentioned as the páñcaudana- \[ ajá-\]\), and not to the five odaná s representing/replacing it. 

It is clear that a billy-goat is supposed to be a real offering in this performance, and that this is supplemented in a concrete way by five portions of mashed rice. It is, however, just as clear that the purpose is quite far from the fulfilment of material desires in life, because it is instead inspired by a specific eschatological doctrine, depending on the gained merits. In fact, the sacrificer aims to reach heaven and, according to PS III 38.11, he is confident in the efficacy of this special performance, due to a successful mythic antecedent, when this special cooking of a 

billy-goat and of five rice-dishes was an action performed by the gods in order to master their worlds:

ajaṃ ca pacata pañca caudanān | ajaṃ pañcaudanaṃ paktvā devā lokān sam ānaśuḥ

Cook \(pl.\) the billy-goat and five rice-dishes. Having cooked the billy-goat of five rice-dishes, the gods have attained the worlds.15

A couple of other ritual details emerge from ŚS IV 14.7cd–9, and from the matching PS 

XVI 99.1–3, i.e. the specific way of positioning the several limbs of the victim and the care given to preserving its integrity, by enveloping all its parts in its skin \(Table 3\).16 

in the sense explained by  Aṣṭādhyāyī IV 3.120 \( tasyedam “this is his/its”\) could be assumed, because a LUK zero-replacement \(i.e. the most generic substitution of an affix with zero, where the zero-replaced affix does not condition any operation on the pre-affixal base\) of taddhita- affixes is taught for dvigu compounds in Aṣṭādhyāyī IV 1.88. But once again, a final accent should instead be expected according to Aṣṭādhyāyī VI 1.223. Cf. pañcakapālá- “prepared in five vessels” where the taddhita affix -á taught by Aṣṭādhyāyī IV 2.16 in the sense of bhakṣa- saṃskṛta- tatra “food prepared here” 

is zero-replaced. Furthermore, the compound páñcaudana- is used 41 times out of 53 as a qualifier, agreeing 27 times with the accusative ajám and 14 with the nominative ajạ́h. This stem is used as an isolated noun in only 8 occurrences, in 7 of which it is a nominative masculine singular, which however excludes the samāhāra dvigu, which has to be singular neuter. 

**15** Translation by Lubotsky 2002: 98 n. 23. 

**16** This second detail also emerges from ŚS IX 5.4 and PS XVI 97.3 \(see below\).

It is also noteworthy that in PS XVI 98.10cd a closely similar group of lexemes conveys a different scenario. 

Despite the emphasis placed on the concrete preparation of the billy-goat as a 

victim, and despite the mention of its four feet, a detail that is certainly more appropriate for a goat than a human being, the overall image in my opinion favours the reading of the sacrificial event described as a prefiguration of the sacrificer’s post-mortem destiny. First of all, the imagery of the goat’s legs firmly planted in several cardinal points aims at stressing the importance of mastering all the faculties – matching with the cardinal points – on the part of the sacrificer, who has to reach his goal safely.17 

The care taken to avoid losing any part of the goat, i.e. to protect all the limbs of the goat, which is also a common issue, for instance, in the major Soma sacrifices and in the cremation rituals,18 here plausibly prefigures the sacrificer’s final purpose of distributing all his faculties all around and finally redeeming them.19

Indeed, if due attention is paid to the specific lexicon employed in these hymns, the ritual framework somehow seems to be downplayed. In fact, it appears to effectively support an eschatological doctrine just as a frame supports the canvas for a painting. According to both ŚS IX 5.8 and its almost matching verse PS XVI 97.6 

\(Table 4\), a movement in five directions is desired for the goat,20 which neverthe-17 Gonda \(1965: 248–249\) notices that “The sure-footed animal was in any case believed to be able to find the passage to the next world” and connects this belief to both the sacrificial horse in ṚVS 

I 162.2–3 and the dead body in ṚVS X 16.4–7. This role of guide is also attributed to the śarabha \(which is also a standard for the billy-goat in ŚS IX 5.9\), i.e. to the markhor \(a large wild goat with very long twisted horns, also called Capra falconeri\), in TS IV 2.10.4 and VSM XIII 51 – see Slaje 2017: 332–333. 

**18** See e.g. ṚVS I 162.18–21 and ṚVS X 16.1; 4 respectively. I am indebted to one of the anonymous reviewers for suggesting this comparison. 

**19** In PS XVI 98.10cd, the imperative form ā kramasva “step towards\!” and indeed the imperative \( ud dhara\) found in the previous hemistich \(PS XVI 98.10cd – see above\) have the same addressee, presumably the sacrificer himself, who has to move within the sacrificial arena in all directions. It is tempting to interpret this behaviour as a sort of ritual mimesis of the sun, which sheds light in several directions during the day, since this sava is commonly interpreted as aiming at the identification of the sacrificer with the sun and at the sacrificer’s securing the world of the light after death \(Shende 1985: 194, 196\). 

**20** As for these cosmographical directions mentioned in the Atharvaveda passages devoted to the sacrifice of the billy-goat, see Rossi 2023: 67–72; 80.

less is going to finally reach heaven, by means of paths that once again converge towards that heaven. The final beneficiary of the action performed with the goat is the sacrificer, but such a double level of roles played by the apparent offering and the sacrificer is managed in a different way in the two recensions. 

**Table 4: **The final goal of both god and sacrificer.

On the basis of the two variant readings ŚS trī́ṇi jyótīṃṣi vs. PS pañca jyotīm̐ṣi, it is important to establish what these lights are, seeing that they are the final goal for both goat and sacrificer. It goes without saying that pañca jyotīm̐ṣi could be a lectio facilior because of the close occurrence of the numeral “five” repeated twice in the same verse, and also because one might casually or mechanically expect that 

a movement in five directions has to reach five destinations, rather than three.21 

By contrast, the different verbal prefixes vi- and ā- combined with the same verbal base kram- seem to sketch a different trajectory in that space, in my opinion a centrifugal motion and a centripetal one respectively. Consequently, the billy-goat has to finally return to a supreme light, often envisioned as a “third light”. But what is more important is that precisely the number “three” associated with bright lights \( jyótis-\) or with the vault of heaven \( nā́ka-\) often recurs in these hymns where the páñcaudana-ajá- is mentioned.22 The relevant passages are collected in Table 5, where the parallels in the two recensions and their differences are highlighted. 

**21** Nonetheless, in VSM XVII 67, the sky is actually imagined as fivefold. 

**22** I would like to thank one of the anonymous reviewers for encouraging me to compare this image with that of the famous Ṛgvedic myth of the three steps of Viṣṇu, whose last step leads to the highest heaven. See ṚVS VII 100.3ab: trír deváḥ pṛthivī́m eṣá etā́ṁ ví cakrame śatárcasam mahitvā́ 

“Τhree times the god stepped across this earth with his greatness”.

Tiziana Pontillo

This comparative survey of passages shows that

– the well-doers’ world \( sukṛ́tāṃ loká-\) is equivalent to the third firmament tṛtī́ya- nā́ka- \(ŚS IX 5.1, 6, 11, PS XVI 97.1, 5, 8–9\);24



– in order to attain such a world, it is mandatory to have previously overcome 

darkness \( támas-: ŚS IX 5.1, 3, 7, 11; PS XVI 97.1, 7–9\), to cleanse oneself of ill-conduct \( dúścarita-: ŚS IX 5.3, PS XVI 97.2\) and to be complete in all parts \( sárvair áṅgaiḥ: ŚS IV 14.9, PS XVI 99.3\); 



– the bright light \( jyótis-\) characterises both this world and the individual who attains it, so that the billy-goat itself is called “third light” \( tṛtī́ya- jyótis-: ŚS IX 

5.11, PS XVI 97.8 – see also ŚS IX 5.7 below\); 

A well-known occurrence of this collocation tṛtī́ya- jyótis- is included in a hymn in the Ṛgveda, which Brereton \(2016\) has brilliantly explained as a funeral text 

devoted to a human being, who will enter the gods’ world, as a god among gods, 

after his body has been transformed through fire into light. 

ṚVS X 56.1:

idáṃ ta ékam pará ū ta ékaṃ tṛtī́yena jyótiṣā sáṃ viśasva |

saṃvéśane tanvàś cā́rur edhi priyó devā́nām paramé janítre ||

Here is one \(light\) of yours, and far away is another. Merge together with the third light. In the merging of your body \(with that light\), be the one cherished, beloved of the gods in your distant birthplace \(Brereton 2016: 168\)

It is precisely with this third light that the body of the deceased should finally merge, after this body has first been the light coming from the funeral fire \(i.e. 

the first light\) and then the light which accomplishes the journey from the earth to heaven \(i.e. the second light\).25 And what might this third light actually be? I assume that it is constituted by the light which arises from the sacrificial fire, called **24** The reward that comes to the sacrificer is expressed in a comparable form in ŚS IX 5.10ab, ṚVS 

1.125.5ab \( nā́kasya pṛṣṭhé ádhi tiṣṭhati śritó yáḥ pṛṇā́ti sá ha devéṣu gachati “The one who grants, stands fixed on the back of the firmament: indeed he goes among the gods”, and in ṚVS IX 113.9abc \( yátrānukāmáṁ cáraṇaṁ trināké tridivé diváḥ lokā́ yátra jyótiṣmantas tátra mā́m amṛ́taṁ kṛdhi 

“Make me immortal where circulation is at will in the one made of three firmaments, three heavens, where there are worlds endowed with light\!”\). I owe the first and second parallels cited here respectively to the two anonymous reviewers. 

**25** Not much information is given about this second light: here it is assumed that it corresponds to the bright path travelled from earth to heaven by the deceased. The path trodden many times in the past by all the offerings made in life by a man and taken to heaven by the god Agni should plausibly be trodden by the man himself after his death. 

What Does the páñcaudana- ajá- Represent in the Śaunakīya- and Paippalāda-Saṁhitās? 

[[171]]

aja- “goat”,26 when it ascends to heaven, beyond all the darkness, where the gods make it available to the sacrificers when they die. It is a fire, which has come into being out of fire \( agnér agnír ádhi sáṃbhū-\), and which attains the world of merit which is full of light \( jyótiṣmat\) or attains it as a being full of light \(see above ŚS IX 

5.6, PS XVI 97.5\). This third light might match the so-called iṣṭapūrtám “something granted by a sacrifice” / iṣṭáṃ pūrtám “rewarded sacrifice”, i.e., “something which gods guarantee to human beings after death as a result of the sacrifices they performed during their life,”27 as it is also overtly explained in ŚS IX 5.13:

ajó hy àgnér ájaniṣṭa śókād vípro víprasya sáhaso vipaścít |

iṣṭáṃ pūrtám abhípūrtaṃ váṣaṭkṛtaṃ tád devā́ ṛtuśáḥ kalpayantu ||

The goat indeed was inspired – born from the flame of the inspired, mighty, wise fire; let the gods arrange what is sacrificed, granted, fulfilled, accompanied with vaṣat- in due order\! 

It is self-evident that every sacrifice was linked to the successful actions of the sacrificer, inasmuch as it depended on the booty gained during expeditions and so 

on.28 Thus, the iṣṭapūrtá  was accumulated by the sacrificer during his life every time he gained the privilege of patronising a sacrifice, but such a “store or treasure-house of good deeds”,29 i.e. his merit, was made available to him after his death, after the last journey of his sacrificial fire towards heaven was brought about \(until the so-called “third light”\) and after his funeral fire had finished burning. In my opinion, the Atharvavedic páñcaudana-ajá- should also be inscribed within the imagery of the tṛtī́ya- jyótis- in ṚVS X 56.1, but in a broader – not exclusively funerary – sense. This billy-goat should indeed represent the sacrificer himself, who is reborn from the fire, being a fire coming into being from another fire, in order to generate a third light in heaven. In fact, in all these Atharvavedic hymns related to the páñcaudana-ajá-, the thematic role of agent attributed to the billy-goat, which is born from the fire and actively moves in several directions, deviates from its more common role of the offering in the sacrifice, i.e. from its syntactic function of object with respect to the actions performed by the officiant priest in the sacrificial **26** In ŚS IX 5.7a, the billy-goat is explicitly identified with jyótis: ajó agnír ajám u jyótir āhur “The billy-goat is agní: they call it ‘light’.” 

**27** See Pontillo 2019b: 48–50 and bibliography quoted there, in particular Windisch 1888 and Sakamoto-Goto 2000. 

**28** As regards this, see Candotti, Neri & Pontillo 2021: 24–36; 42–60. 

**29** I am quoting an expression used by Collins \(1982: 54\) to define the iṣṭāpūrta.

arena.30 Particularly telling is the prevalence of active verbal forms in ŚS IX 5.1/PS 

XVI 97.1 \( gacchatu, tīrtvā́, ā́ kramatāṃ – see above\) and the emphasised image of the birth of fire, i.e. its coming into being from the sacrificial fire and its movement starting from it, both in ŚS IX 5.6/PS XVI 97.5 \( út krāmā́taḥ, sáṃ babhūvitha – see above\) ,  and in Table 6, referring to a mythical past:

**Table 6: **Attaining a god-like state. 

**ŚS IV 14.1**

**PS III 38 1**

ajó hy àgnér ájaniṣṭa śókāt

Indeed, the billy-goat has been born =

só ‘paśyaj janitā́ram ágre | 

from the heat of the fire. It saw 

arohann upa medhīyāṃsaḥ

in the beginning him who begot 

téna róhān ruruhur médhyāsaḥ ||   himself. Through it in the beginning the gods came to god-like state. 

Through it, those fit for the sacrifice 

ascended to the ascents.31 

As far as the human sacrificer is concerned, only at the end of his life is he supposed to be ready to share a god-like state, after accumulating merit throughout his life, especially through sacrifices, and merit is envisioned as a newly attained body entirely made of light:

ṚVS X 14.8 \(= ŚS XVIII 3.58 = PS XVIII 75.1\):

sáṃ gachasva pitṛ́bhiḥ sáṃ yaméneṣṭāpūrténa paramé vyòman |

hitvā́yāvadyám púnar ástam éhi sáṃ gachasva tanvā̀ suvárcāḥ ||

Unite with the forefathers, unite with Yama, with what has been bestowed due to the sacrifice, in the highest distant heaven. Having left behind imperfection, come home again. Unite with your body in your full luster. \(tr. Jamison, Brereton 2014: 1392 modified\). 

The billy-goat arising from the sacrificial fire might have been a fitting image for 

“the sacrificer’s new body” acquired in the highest heaven, within the framework 

of the idea of a body’s recovery after death, as reconstructed by Fujii \(2011: 108–109, 2012: 108–113\) with the help of ṚVS X 14.8 and some other Ṛgvedic passages \(ṚVS X 

**30** As noted above \(§ 1 fn. 14\), the stem páñcaudana- is more often used as a qualifier agreeing with the accusative ajám. See e.g. ŚS IV 14.6: ajám anajmi páyasā ghṛténa “With milk, with ghee, I anoint the billy-goat”. 

**31** Gonda \(1965: 248\) notices that this stanza was used \(with slight variation\) in MS II 7.17, KS XVI 17, TS IV 2.10, VSM XIII 51, ŚBM VII 5.2.36, which mention the sacrificial action of removing the head of the billy-goat during the ceremonies connected with the so-called great fire-altar.

[[173]]

15.14, 16.5\). Indeed, rather than purely being asked “to return to his body”32 in ṚVS 

X 14.8 the dead man seems to be invited “to wear a new body”, which I assume to 

be the body of light stored in heaven and recovered after one dies. This image of a garment to be changed is in fact employed in the following verse:

ŚS XVIII 2.57 \(≈ PS XVIII 68.6\):

etát tvā vā́saḥ prathamáṃ nv ā́gann ápaitád ūha yád ihā́bibhaḥ purā́ |

iṣṭāpūrtám anusáṃkrāma vidvā́n yátra te dattáṃ bahudhā́ víbandhuṣu ||

This is the garment \(i.e. the body\) which indeed first came to you; remove the one you were wearing before: reach what is granted by sacrifices \( iṣṭāpūrtá\) by knowing where it was given to you, in many ways, among people having no relations\!33

The permanent nature of such an achievement emerges from ŚS IX 5.20–22 and 

PS XVI 99.6–8 \(Table 7\), where the intriguing expression áparimita- yajna-  seems to hint at endless merit gained by means of such a sacrifice, confirmed by the consistent phrase aparimitaṃ lokaṃ  denoting the target attained, namely a world to be enjoyed forever. 

In the collection of hymns analysed here, the tṛtī́ya- jyótis- appears to be the kernel of a specific eschatological doctrine and this image in particular might have been the original insight, which instead seems to become slightly more fuzzy when the passages use the apparently alternative phrase tṛtī́ya- nā́ka- “third firmament”. 

The inspiring idea could plausibly have originated from the real experience of 

watching what happened to the victim or to the body of the deceased man, trans-

formed by fire into light when they were burned in the sacrificial fire or put on the funeral pyre respectively. 

**32** See e.g. Sāyaṇa-Bhāṣya on ṚVS X 14.8, which paraphrases tanvā̀ of the phrase sáṃ gachasva tanvā̀ with svaśarireṇa. 

**33** Whitney & Lanman 1905 translated víbandhuṣu “among them of various connections”, but they placed a question mark in brackets next to this noun. The translation proposed here is based on the assumed sacrificer’s fear of not being able, after his death, to recognise his individual or familiar merits, as highlighted by Sakamoto Gotō 2000. This risk might have arisen when the sacrificer started depending ‘on a number of ritual specialists to perform the sacrifice for his benefit’, because indeed he ʻrealized the results of the sacrifice indirectly’ \(Tull 1990: 35\). In other words, there was the risk that the merits gained by the sacrifice were stored in a wrong place, belonging to people with no relation to him.

**3 Solar Imagery in the páñcaudana-**** ajá-**

The imagery of the ‘dramatic’ fiery pillar of fire and flames which arise when milk is added to the heated Gharma-pot during the Pravargya-ritual was already studied in ṚVS I 164 by Houben \(2000\) as a plausible ‘laboratory’ \(the term is specifically used in Houben 2000: 529\) of some speculative reflections on the possibility of humans gaining an immortal state. “In fact the Gharma-milk becomes a sort of inverted 

lightning, unexpectedly directed at heaven, and represents the initiated man, 

whose identification with the sun is ritually targeted” \(Pontillo 2019a: 256\).36 Such an image is also at the core of an Atharvavedic stanza \(Table 8\), which according to Selva \(2019: 374\) “explicitly describes the vratins’ path of the gharmasya vrata  as modelled after that of the gods \( devā́ḥ\),  as a spiritual path \(“having abandoned the body”\), and as aiming at the world of merit \( sukṛtásya lokáṃ\), which is regarded as the abode or the location of immortality \[. . .\].” 

**Table 8: **The abode of immortality.

As Lubotsky \(2002: 31\) pointed out, it is noteworthy that the formula téna geṣma sukṛtásya lokáṃ, i.e. the prayer aimed at attaining the world of merit, present in both recensions, is also employed in the very first passage quoted above \(ŚS IV 14.6, PS III 38.5 – § 1\), where it is just the páñcaudana-ajá- which** **plays the role of the gharmá by ensuring ascent to that highest world. Furthermore, our starting quotation already contained a possible poetic hint at the gharmá in ŚS IV 14.6, where the billy-goat is depicted by means of words belonging to the Vedic solar imagery, such **36** In Pontillo 2019a, I assumed that ṚVS X 181 might have hinted at the same notion. See in particular ṚVS X 181.3: tè ’vindan mánasā dī́dhyānā yáju ṣkannám prathamáṃ devayā́nam | dhātúr dyútānāt savitúś ca víṣṇor ā́ sū́ryād abharan gharmám eté “By focusing their minds on it, they found the first sprinkled formula which goes to the gods. They brought here the gharmá- from Sūrya who is the Founder, the Flashing one, the Vivifier, the All-pervasive one.”

[[177]]

as “the heavenly eagle, milky, great” \( ajám \[. . .\] divyáṃ suparnáṃ payasáṃ bṛhántam \[. . .\]\).37 Dore \(2015a: 57–64, Dore 2015b\) has clearly explained the importance of the solar imagery broadly used in Atharvavedic and Ṛgvedic texts \(e.g. in ṚVS X 

136, ŚS II 1, IV 11, XI 15, XIII 1, XV 1, XV 18\) to depict the renowned figures of the keśín, róhita, ekavrātyá and brahmacārín, all of whom are connected to a so-called Vrātya cultural matrix and aim at an esoteric knowledge shared by men and gods, 

who finally enter the sun. We also discover that the final aim in the páñcaudana-ajá- savá-  is precisely to win the world of the sun in ŚS IX 5.18: ajáḥ pakváḥ svargé loké dadhāti páñcaudano nírṛtiṃ bā́dhamānaḥ |

téna lokā́nt sū́ryavato jayema ||

The cooked billy-goat with five portions of mashed rice, eliminating corruption, sets \[us\] in the heavenly world: may we conquer worlds that possess the sun\! 

Malinar \(see e.g. 1996: 335, 2007: 38\) taught us long ago that it is difficult to overestimate the importance in Vedic and Sanskrit sources of the recurring emphasis 

placed on the desired identification with the sun, which is also the final immortal location for the deceased man’s body, mentioned in e.g. ṚVS X 14.8 \(see above, § 

2\), when the dead man is invited to unite with it \( sáṃ gachasva tanvā̀ suvárcāḥ 

“Unite with your body in your full luster\!”\). The solar image is crucially used in the soteriological context which Malinar insightfully called the “law of heroism”, in which the greatest human achievement, man’s immortality, is depicted as a vision 

of solar light, as demonstrated especially in ŚvU III 8 and BhG VIII 9–10.38 This solar imagery might date back to several centuries earlier than these sources \(Pontillo 2016: 236–238\), since ŚvU III 8 exactly matches ṚvKh 4,11.9a:39

vedāhaṃ etaṃ puruṣaṃ mahantam ādityavarṇaṃ tamasaḥ parastāt

**39** As is well known, the Ṛgveda Khilāni – which are still quoted as a genuine part of the Ṛgveda in the Anukramaṇī \(5th–3rd BCE\) – may date back at least to the age of the Yajurveda Saṃhitā and cannot be later than the Brāhmaṇas \(9th–6th BCE\) – see Scheftelowitz 1906: 11–16, Sontakke-Kashikar 1933–1951, Vol. 4: 903, Bhise 1995: 8.

Tiziana Pontillo

The lexicon used in our páñcaudana- ajá- collection seems to be close to these solar passages. We have already examined three passages where the theme of the darkness \( támas\) to be crossed is emphasised \(see above, tīrtvā́ támāṃsi “after crossing the darkness” in ŚS IX 5.1, 3, PS XVI 97.1\). Elsewhere \(Table 9\), instead of the verb tṝ- “to cross”, the compound verb apa-han- “to smite away” is used, as follows: **Table 9: **Smiting the darkness away. 

**ŚS IX 5.7cd = ŚS IX **

**Cf. PS XVI 97.8cd–9**

The billy-goat sacrificed in the fire with five portions of mashed rice, bursting like the gharmá  in the Pravargya, allows the sacrificer to attain the third firmament, i.e. 

it is a path towards the enjoyment of immortality as an effect of ritual merits. And it is tempting to assume that some other sacrificial images like that of the white-footed sheep with its five cakes of flour \( páñcāpūpa- śitipā́d- avi- ŚS III 29.4\)40 might have been an analogous image of the achievement of a permanent stay in heaven, 

as the unlimited fruit of sacrifices \(and indirectly of actions\). This leads one to wonder what specific notion has inspired the imagery of the páñcaudana-ajá-, for instance in comparison with the gharmá  image. 

**40**  páñcāpūpaṃ śitipā́dam áviṃ lokéna sáṃmitam | pradātópa jīvati pitṝṇā́m loké ’kṣitam | “The giver subsists on the white-footed sheep with its five cakes of flour, which is commensurate with his world and which does not decay in the world of the ancestors.” 

What Does the páñcaudana- ajá- Represent in the Śaunakīya- and Paippalāda-Saṁhitās? 

[[179]]

**4  The Self with Its Five Faculties**

The aforementioned journey of a fire born from the sacrificial fire towards the 

place where merit is stored as light, more than representing a purely spiritual path, seems to be a journey \(from the earth upward\) accomplished by the body with its 

five faculties of perception, to attain a deathless state through the sacrificial fire. I believe that such an image sheds light on Keith’s \(1925: 423\) reading of cremation: The exact idea connected with the burning seems to have been that the whole self was burned, soul as well as body, in order to convey it, in a refined form but still unaltered in essence, to the regions of heaven. 

Thus, from a soteriological perspective, I assume that the billy-goat represents the psychophysical self, endowed with all its faculties, which is burnt to ensure that the sacrificer gains a new permanent self among the gods. This sacrifice might 

have symbolically represented the ascetic and heroic self-immolation of the sacrificer, which, at least in its prototypical version, is assumed to be a part of the sattra \(see e.g. Lévi 1898: 133; Tull 1990: 55; Malamoud 2002: 21\). Such self-immolation of the sacrificer is an accepted practice in the so-called sattra- culture \(see above 

§ 0. Premise\) and it has plausibly to be read within the framework of a society 

grounded in the institution of brotherhood such as the vrātya society \(as suggested by Heestermann 1987: 98\), where the sthapati as primus inter pares plays the role of an ascetic who sacrifices himself by carrying out the observances \( vrata-\) for the whole group \(Dore & Pontillo 2016: 12; Pontillo 2023\). 

This offering of one’s psychophysical self instead of any other material oblation could have been considered the best way of fulfilling human desires, among which 

the greatest was the permanent enjoyment of a new individual entity, exempt from 

any decay, in the afterlife. The pun built on the homophony between ajá- “goat”, and a-já- “unborn, ever existing”41 may have suggested this interpretation of the goat’s offering as a means of achieving the permanent existence of the self. This self, envisioned as the ajá- arisen from the fire, merges with the body gained by the sacrifice by means of merit, which is stored in heaven until the death of the sacrificer. Thus, **41** See Gonda \(1965: 65\): “I would \[. . .\] suppose the divinization of the he-goat – whose name may also be understood as the ‘unborn one’ i.e. ‘he who exists from all eternity’ – to have been facilitat-ed by the speculations on that divine being whose name, it is true, occurs in the AV \(19, 11, 3\), but not in the relevant sutras”, i.e. ajá ékapad. 

**180** 

Tiziana Pontillo

it is consistent that the following two parallel stanzas \(Table 10\) insist on the idea of a new rūpá-, i.e. of a new visible appearance assumed by one who sacrifices the páñcaudana-ajá- and the main action is always conveyed by the verb sam-gam- “to come together/to unite”. In the Paippalāda version, the word akṣiti- “non-decay/

imperishableness” clearly confirms that the new individual entity which will be 

permanently enjoyed in the afterlife will be exempt from any decay. 

**Table 10: **A new visible appearance.

And how can this access to heaven become a permanent destiny? I shall attempt 

to answer by means of an intertextual comparison, relying on the lexicon involved here. The non-decay \( akṣiti-\) of what is granted by sacrifices \( iṣṭāpūrta-\) is indeed a crucial notion in a passage from the Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa text \(Table 11\), within the esoteric teaching given by the controversial figure42 of the Pañcāla king Keśin Dārbhya to a deceased king of the same tribe. According to Vādhūlasūtra 37, the need for such a teaching depended on the fact that this deceased king \(Yājñasena\) was precisely afraid of the expiry of his iṣṭāpūrta \( iṣṭāpūrtasya kṣityai bibhayāṃ cakāra\).43

**42** See e.g. Sarma 1968: 241, Amano 2013: 18, Kulkarni 2016. 

**43** See also Caland 1928: 149. The same risk is recorded in KB VII 4, where the compound iṣṭāpūrta-  is replaced by sakṛd iṣṭa-  literally “once sacrificed” and in AB VII 21, where kṣiti- is replaced by parijyāni-  literally “not falling into decay”. The idea of fear appears in KB VII 4, where the golden wild goose declares: sakṛd ayaje tasya kṣayād bibhemi. sakṛdiṣṭasyāho tvam akṣitiṃ vettha tām tvaṃ mahyam iti “Once I was a sacrificer: I am afraid of the perishableness of that. You know the imperishableness of that which once has been offered. Oh\! May you \[explain\] this to me\!” Lévi \(1898: 108\) interpreted sakṛd as “une fois pour toutes”, so that the fear that the fruit of sacrifices might be impermanent might here have been compared with and opposed to the desire that this fruit might instead become permanent. 

What Does the páñcaudana- ajá- Represent in the Śaunakīya- and Paippalāda-Saṁhitās? 

[[181]]

Now, Caland \(1931: XIX\) considered the Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa to be older than the other available Sāmaveda Brāhmaṇa, i.e. the Pañcaviṃśa-Brāhmaṇa, on the basis of a collection of generally ignored rites included in the Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa. 

The Jaiminīya school is generally considered older than the Kauthuma-Rāṇāyaṇīya 

Śākhā, due to its accordance with the surviving Nambudiri Ṛgveda and Yajurveda 

traditions.44 On the contrary, Keith decided in favour of the anteriority of the 

Pañcaviṃśa-Brāhmaṇa, especially because of linguistic evidence.45 However, several portions of the Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa are often quite conservative in terms of contents. This may be due to its \(ritual and narrative\) eclectic prolixity, which has evidently led this text to voraciously incorporate ideas borrowed from different schools and thus at least partially retain them.46 However, more generally speaking, it might overall have been one of the most recently fixed Brāhmaṇa texts, perhaps only earlier than the Ṣaḍviṃśa-Brāhmaṇa and the Gopatha-Brāhmaṇa \(Bodewitz 1973: 13\). 

Thus, I shall resort to this late source, in order to try to understand what the 

five odana s might have represented in their association with the billy-goat. In fact, JB II 53–54, where no goat is mentioned, explains how the individual faculties given **44** See Witzel 2016: 69. 

**45** See Keith 1932a: 700, 1932b: 1049. Renou \(1947: 101\) endorsed Keith’s evaluation. The chronological problem is amplified by the assumed existence of a third Sāmaveda Brāhmaṇa, mentioned as Śāṭyāyanakam brāhmaṇam  or Śāṭyāyani-Brāhmaṇa  or Śāṭyāyanakam in several Kalpasūtras or by commentators \(see Ghosh 1935: 98–101 fragments 55–66, Parpola 1973: 9–10, Bodewitz 1973: 11–12, Gonda 1975: 349, Witzel 1989: § 5.2\). 

**46** See Keith 1932b: 1048, Renou 1947: 101–102, Gonda 1975: 348, Fujii 2012: 112.

during the sacrifice match the relevant gods and divine worlds and how these can 

finally be “redeemed”. 

**Table 11: **The impershableness of the** ** iṣṭāpūrta-.  

**JB II 53–54**

keśī ha dārbhyo darbhaparṇayor 47  didīkṣe  Keśin Dārbhya was indeed consecrated on Darbha\[-grass\] 

| atha ha sutvā yājñaseno 48  haṃso 

and Parṇa\[-leaves\]. Then Yājñasena, who had performed 

hiraṇmayo bhūtvā 49  yūpa upaviveśa | 

Soma sacrifices in the past, assumed the semblance of 

\[. . .\]

a golden wild goose, sitting on the sacrificial post. \[. . .\] 

You know the imperishableness of what is granted by 

iṣṭāpūrtasya tvam akṣitiṃ vettha | dīkṣām  sacrifices, I know the consecration. ‘Let us explain \[these ahaṃ veda saṃprabravāvahā 50  iti | 51

two objects of knowledge\] to one another\!’

\[. . .\]

\[. . .\]

**47** As noticed by Koskikallio \(1991: 314 n. 43\), “The correct sitting base should have been a black deerskin \( kṛṣṇājina\)” – see also Caland \(1919: 138 n. 6\) who refers to ŚBM I 1.4.3. In JB II 100 the story is told of how Pañcāla children mocked Darbha \(Śatānīka’s son\), by addressing him with the words darbha darbha, but, in the end, he was actually honoured as a king by all the Pañcālas because he had performed the Apaciti sacrifice. In BŚS XVIII 38–39, after King Keśin Dālbhya’s Apaciti sacrifice, the Pañcālas changed the word for grass from darbha to kuśa and created a new word for hair, namely the plural noun śīrṣanyāḥ, which literally means “those on the head” \( śīrṣaṇyā iti keśān ācakṣate\) – for further links between darbha-grass and Vrātyas, see Dore & Pontillo 2013. 

According to Caland \(1903: 25\) and Witzel \(1989: 101 n. 6\), the king himself might have consequently been called Śairṣaṇya Kauśa. However, Heesterman \(1962: 16\) has also connected the vrātya epithet keśin with the name Śirṣaṇya and with the well-known Pañcāla clan name Śīrṣādi, which literally means ‘whose name begins with \[a reference to the\] head’. 

**48** At the beginning of the KB \(and of the Śāṅkhāyana Brāhmaṇa\) versions there is no mention of this name: taṃ ha hiraṇmayaḥ śakuna āpatyovāca “To him flew up a golden bird and said” \(KB 7.4\). 

sutvan is here interpreted as a common noun which might qualify Yājñasena as a man who pressed the Soma, i.e. someone who had been a patron of Soma sacrifices in the past, in accordance with A III 2.103, especially because in the VādhS version \(fragment 37 Caland 1928: 148\) a sort of synonym, i.e. bahuyājin- “who performed many sacrifices” also occurs. Nonetheless Caland \(1919: 138, 1928: 148\) considers sutvan- as a proper name and in AB VIII 28 it is actually used for another character. 

**49** For the hypothesis that “royal and demigodly roles” might have assured a supermundane, Gandharva-like bird state in Vedic and post-Vedic sources, see Koskikallio 1999: 314 n. 44; 352–356. 

**50** Ehlers \(1988: 10\) prefers a first dual form instead of a first person plural form on the basis of the following paragraph \(JB II 54\). The context itself supports this emendation. The plural form is instead given by both Caland \(1919: 137\) and Vira-Chandra \(1954: 178\) – the latter with a misprint in the vowel of the verbal base \( saṃprabruvāmahā iti\). 

**51** In KB VII 5 the two characters are said to “explain together” \( saṃprocate\) and in VādhS XXXVII the reciprocity is underlined by the symmetry of the following two sentences: tāṃ tvam asmabhyaṃ 

brūhi, vayaṃ tubhyaṃ vakṣyāma iti bhagava iti, “May you explain this to us \(i.e. the imperishableness of what is granted by sacrifices\) and we shall explain \[the sacrificer’s consecration \(Dīkṣā\)\] to you.”

**52** Caland \(1919: 138\) translates this sentence as “Darauf der andere:” and puts the name “Sutvan” 

in brackets, but – in agreement with Kulkarni \(2016: 76\) – I consider that this passage openly focuses on the concept conveyed by the verb kṣi- “to perish” just as the term akṣiti- is used to define the special object of Keśin’s knowledge. 

**53** Caland \(1919: 138\) interprets this verb as meaning “to give a Dakṣiṇā” 

**54** As pointed out by Caland \(1919: 138 n. 5\), this passage corresponds to ĀpŚS XIII 6.4–6. See also AB VII 21.

Tiziana Pontillo

Only the words conveying the elements that change have been quoted from this 

lengthy formularised passage, which is entirely devoted to perfectly parallel explanations of how one can achieve this non-decay \( akṣiti-\) of merit by giving a specific officiant all of one’s faculties in order to be compensated with the gift of some permanent elements of nature, namely fire, wind, sun, ether, cardinal points, plants and trees. To sum up, this giving of individual faculties and body parts that allows one to gain a new impermanent body brings to mind a comparison between the 

sacrificial way to gain access to heaven and the ascetic way, perhaps also symbolically represented by the two interlocutors who are two kings from two subse-

quent generations of leaders of the same tribe, one named after the sacrifice itself \( yājñasena- and perhaps sutvan-\) and the other for whom the vrātya epithet keśin is used. The explanation Keśin Dārbhya gives of this sort of “self-offering” pattern of sacrifice is, however, consistent with the common logic of the sacrificial arena including all the officiating priests and the patron of the sacrifice, and in particular a specific priest as a single recipient of each given faculty. Of course, the mere sacrificial mechanism is replaced by the ascetic effort to offer and then redeem oneself at the end of one’s life by attaining a permanent divine state through the merits gained by means of sacrifices. 

Hence, it is not unreasonable to wonder whether an ancient doctrine aimed 

at achieving a deathless state with a permanent body is perhaps kept alive in late Vedic passages, and indeed better explained there than in earlier sources. Thus, the páñcaudana-ajá- might also have been a poetic hinting at such an early eschatological belief, aimed at envisioning the \(ascetic\) offering of oneself with one’s own five faculties of perception which are supposed to be given back to the respective worlds and then redeemed by means of the sacrifice itself, so that all of the merit can be redeemed. 

his faculties of thinking, seeing, hearing and speaking “form the object of the rite” instead of “some external gods” in the Agnihotra “viewed as an ātmayajña” \(the bracketed words are borrowed from Bodewitz 1973: 19\). The purpose is to create a new immortal body \(JB I 2\): \[. . .\] so ’ ta āhutimayo manomayaḥ prāṇamayaś cakṣurmayaś | śrotramayo vāṅmaya ṛṅmayo yajurmayas sāmamayo brahmamayo | hiraṇyamayo ’mṛtas saṃbhavati | amṛtā haivāsya prāṇā bhavanti | amṛtaśarīram idaṃ kurute \[. . .\] “He \(arises\) from this \(fire\) and becomes immortal in the form of an oblation, mind, breath, sight, hearing, speech, ṛc, yajus sāman, brahman and gold. His lifebreaths become immortal. He makes for himself an immortal body here” \(tr. Bodewitz 1973: 20\). The same five elements are used by Keśin’s interlocutor in the KB VII 4 version of the Kaiśinī Dīkṣā and they are all singled out as the dīḳsita’ s gods. 

What Does the páñcaudana- ajá- Represent in the Śaunakīya- and Paippalāda-Saṁhitās?

**5  Conclusions**

Bearing in mind the contents of the above-quoted Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa passage, the following quotation might hint at a comparable mechanism of giving and redeeming all one’s own faculties, like Keśin Dārbhya’s teaching. It comes just before one of the clearest stanzas explaining the billy-goat’s twofold motion outwards and 

inwards \(quoted above, ŚS IX 5.20, PS XVI 99.6\). 

ŚS IX 5.19 = PS XVI 99.5:

yáṃ brāhmaṇé nidadhé yáṃ ca vikṣú yā́ viprúṣa odanā́nām ajásya |

sárvaṃ tád agne sukr̥tásya loké jānītā́n naḥ saṃgámane pathīnā́m ||

That which he puts before the brahmán and among people, the drops scattered, belong to the rice-portions, to the goat: all that of ours, O Agni, you later know in the world of merit, at the meeting of the ways. 

The billy-goat comes from and comes back to the saṃgámana, i.e. from the meeting point of the several ways \(note the recurring verbal base sam-gam- e.g. above ṚVS X 

14.8 = ŚS XVIII 3.58 = PS XVIII 75.1; ŚS IX 5.24 = PS XVI 99.10\). A sort of circularity of the way trodden by the self is depicted especially in the incipit of hymn IV 14, where it is explained that the billy-goat saw the one who begot himself. 

Furthermore, the two emphasised ritual details \(see above, § 1\), i.e. the specific way of positioning the several limbs of the victim and the attention paid to preserving its integrity, also gain a different meaning that is not purely ritualistic in that they do not merely comply with the rules of orthopraxy peculiar to a sacrificial 

arena dominated by the technical competence of the officiant. In the background 

emerges the aim to safeguard all the limbs to be redeemed as parts of a new permanent body. As Tull has noticed \(1990: 25\), the “idea that the rebirth process entails the individual’s integration into the constituents of the cosmos” also emerges in ṚVS X 16.3ab \( sū́ryam cákṣur gachatu vā́tam ātmā dyā́ṃ ca gacha pṛthivī́ṃ ca dhár-maṇā “Let the eye go to the sun, the breath to the wind, go to the sky and to the earth in due order\!”\), as the reversal of the myth of the origin of the whole cosmos from the limbs of the primeval anthropomorphic being \(ṚVS X 90\). The “correspondence between the vital functions and the cosmic entities” is also taken for 

granted in some renowned Upaniṣadic reflections on man’s destiny after death that are outside the Brahmanical cultural mainstream, such as the eschatological questions Ārtabhāga asks to Yājñavalkya in BĀU III 3.13.56 This is a concept linked to **56** \[. . .\] yátrāsya púruṣasya mṛtásyāgníṃ vā́g apyéti vā́taṃ prāṇáś cákṣur ādityáṃ mánaś candráṃ 

díśaḥ śrótraṃ \[. . .\]  kvā̀yáṃ tadā́ púruṣo bhavatī́ti “\[. . .\] When a man has died, and his speech disappears into fire, his breath into the wind, his sight into the sun, his mind into the moon, his hearing into the quarters \[. . .\] what then happens to that person?” \(Olivelle 1998: 81\).

that of the “deceased’s new body after death” and to the “making of the self \( ātman\) in the rituals”, dating back to the same sources and to ŚS XIX 43, along with some other later sources, as indicated by Fujii \(2012: 108–110\). Even the brahmaṇaḥ parimaraḥ in AB VIII 28 and the daivaḥ parimaraḥ in KU II 12–14, which explain “the dying around of the powers”, i.e. the cyclical death and rebirth of the faculties of perception \(often called deva s\), might have been inspired by the same belief, as a counterpart of the cycle of cosmic powers i.e. of the deities, in accordance with Bodewitz’s interpretation \(2002: 38 n. 129\). 

The accumulation of numerical equivalences on the basis of the number “five” 

especially proposed in the final part of ŚS IX 5, i.e. the mention of five plus one seasons \(vv. 31–36\), five golden discs \( páñca rukmā́\) ,  five new garments \( páñca návāni vástrā\), five milch-cows \( páñca \[. . .\] dhenávaḥ\) in vv. 25–26, contribute to making it difficult to grasp the assumed reference to the five organs of sense \(plus one, i.e. manas\), unless one makes use of a lexically grounded intertextual comparison, as I have attempted to do here.57 Nonetheless, the consistency of the quest for the permanent enjoyment of a new body made of light in all the páñcaudana-ajá- passages and the opposition between the centrifugal and centripetal motion of fire/billy-goat, which steps out from heaven and then steps back into it again in the same stanzas, call for cautious analysis, before uncritically accepting that the analysed hymns are mere savá hymns, paving the way for an easy sacrificial offering. It is rather important to emphasise that the permanent stay in heaven 

described in these texts is different from that described in more brahmanically 

oriented texts, because the role played by officiating priests is marginal and more attention is paid to the meaning of rituals than to their technical details. The páñcaudana- ajá-  imagery might thus have conveyed a noteworthy step in the history of reflections on the afterlife, perhaps destined to remain forever at the periphery of Brahmanical doctrines, like the majority of the Atharvavedic and Upaniṣadic 

theoretical issues. 

**57** The reference to the remarried woman in ŚS IX 5.27 and the list of relatives in ŚS IX 5.30 could also be puzzling at first glance, but they are indeed consistent with the reflection on what the sacrificer keeps after death and with the collective clan-based dimension of merit.
