**Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs **

**and Gandharvas**

**Abstract:** In the following, I explore several possible meanings of the epithet śvànvant-, attributed to the Apsarases in both Atharvaveda Saṁhitās but not found outside these texts. While it is extremely difficult to arrive at any firm conclusions, I highlight the fact that this epithet only occurs in passages where the Apsarases are depicted as being threatening and harmful. With this in mind, I suggest that the 

‘dogs’ \( śván-\) that accompany the Apsarases are most likely a metaphorical reference to either death or the Gandharvas. One way of making sense of the latter metaphor, I propose, is to view the figure of the Gandharva alongside related figures from other branches of Indo-European mythology. 

**1 Introduction**

The word śvànvant-, attested only in the feminine \( śvànvatī-\) plural, is an epithet attributed to Apsarases in both Atharvaveda Saṁhitās but found nowhere else in 

Vedic or indeed in later Sanskrit literature.1 There is no unanimous agreement as to the meaning of the term. In the Petersburger Wörterbuch \(PW VII\), Böhtlingk and Roth \(1875: 411\) settle for the non-committal “Bein\[ame\]. einer Klasse von Apsaras”. 

Elsewhere, Henry \(1896: 128\) renders śvànvatīr apsarásaḥ at Śaunaka-Saṁhitā 

\(ŚS\) 11.9.15a as “\[l\]es Apsaras déguisées en chiennes”; Griffith \(1896: 86\) translates the same pāda as “Apsarases with dog-like mates”, providing the gloss “wedded 

to Gandharvas who are described as hairy like dogs and monkeys”,2 and śatáṁ 

śaśvanvátīnām 3 at ŚS 19.36.6c as “\[a\] hundred of dog-mated nymphs” \(Griffith 1896: 294\); for Bloomfield \(1897: 125\), it is the Apsarases rather than their mates that are **1** On the unexpected svarita accent on the first vowel, Whitney and Lanman \(1905: 653\) write: 

“The accent of çvànvatīs seems certainly wrong, but it is read by all the mss., and avouched by the commentary to Prāt. \[= ŚS-Prātiśākhya\] iii.73.” On the latter, see Deshpande \(1997: 446\). 

**2** Griffith cites ŚS 4.37.11 in support of this interpretation, on which more below. 

**3** This can now be emended, following PS 2.27.6c, to śatáṁ śvanvátīnām \(Zehnder 1999: 81–82; Griffiths 2009: 385\).

“dog-like”; Whitney and Lanman \(1905: 653\) opt for “\[d\]og-accompanied”,4 and this has been since taken up by Renou \(1965: 30 “accompagnées de chiens”\), Zysk \(1996: 112 “accompanied by dogs”\), Zehnder \(1999: 81–82 “von Hunden begleiteten”\), and 

Griffiths \(2009: 383–396 “dog-accompanied”\). Spiers \(2020: 304–305\) also takes the 

“dérivé d’appartenance” śvāvanta- m., occurring only at Paippalāda-Saṁhitā \(PS\) 3.17.2d, as “proche des \[Apsaras\] accompagnées de chiens”/“a relative of the dog-accompanied \[Apsaras\]”\), while allowing that it could alternatively mean “appar-

enté à ceux qui se comportent en chiens”. 

It should be noted at the outset that of the two interpretations of the adjecti-

val -vant- suffix summarised above, namely the possessive \(‘dog-accompanied’ etc.\) and the comparative \(‘dog-like’ etc.\), possessive -vant- occurs far more commonly in Vedic, and the validity of the comparative in cases such as śvànvant- has several times been called into question.5 Indeed, the scarcity of comparative - vant- in old Vedic, other than when attached as a suffix to pronominal stems, alone tips the 

balance in favour of the possessive allomorph - vant- in this instance. As will be proposed in the following, the same conclusion is also suggested from a semantic 

point of view. Although Apsarases are commonly likened to various animals,6 and 

indeed possess a shape-shifting ability to embody multiple animal forms,7 they are, with one possible exception,8 nowhere likened to dogs, whereas cogent arguments 

can be made for their being accompanied by them. 

**4** As Griffiths \(2009: 385\) notes, this is “perhaps influenced by Sāyaṇa’s gloss śunā krīḍārthena sārameyeṇa sahitāḥ”. At ŚS 19.36.6c, Whitney and Lanman \(1905: 956\) revert to “doglike ones” \(see next note\). 

**5** See especially Debrunner \(1954: 876 §706a\) who, citing Whitney and Lanman’s \(1905: 956\) translation of ŚS 19.36.6c śvanvátīnām as “doglike ones”, asserts that -vant- with comparative value is, other than when attached to pronominal stems, “nicht gesichert”. Zysk \(1996: 112\) responds to the same translation with the curt dismissal “quite wrong”. See also Barth \(2018: 24\) on comparative, or in her words “pronominal ‘equative’” -vant-: “Adnominals of this type and with this meaning are exclusively built to pronominal stems”. Cf. Bender \(1910: 69–70\): “In a number of the vant possessives \(less than 1%\) the suffix expresses resemblance or similarity . . . Most of these words, especially those in use in the earlier language, are formed from pronominal stems”. Note here Pinault’s \(1985: 349–350\) point that the possessive suffix -vant-  and the comparative suffix -vant-  are 

“deux suffixes, qui n’ont pas la même histoire” \(p. 350\). 

**6** See especially RV 10.95, wherein Apsarases are likened to, for instance, a startled gazelle \(8c tarásantī ná bhujyúḥ: on tras  see Mayrhofer 1992: 678; on bhujyú- ‘gazelle’ see Geldner 1951: 301 and Mayrhofer 1996: 265\), to mares \(8d nā́śvāḥ; see Knobl 2009: 198 \[60\]\), and to ducks \(9c ātáyo ná\). Apsarases also appear as ducks \( ātí-\) in the other classic Vedic account of the story of Purūravas and Urvaśī \(ŚBM 11.5.1.4\). 

**7** On Apsarases as shape-shifters, see e.g. RV 10.95.16a; ŚBM 11.5.1.4; Rām 4.65.8; KūP 1.22.36.

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[195]]

While the basic meaning of the nominal stem śván- ‘dog\(s\)’ has not led to such disagreements as have been elicited by the suffix, it gives rise in turn to a new set of questions, and principal among these are those which motivate this article, namely: what exactly is meant by ‘dog\(s\)’ in the word śvànvatī-, and what do Apsarases have to do with dogs? Before proceeding to address these questions, I first list the six verses in the Atharvaveda wherein the word śvànvant- \(Ś\) occurs:

Ś1. yā adharād ācaranti jihmā mukhā karikratīḥ |

āhatā apa tā ito naśyantv ataḥ śvanvatīḥ 9 || PS 1.29.2

Those who approach from the south, constantly contorting their faces, \[let\] them \[go away\] 

from here, beaten. Let those dog-accompanied ones disappear from here \(translation by Zehnder et al. 2024\)

Ś2. śataṁ jahy apsarasāṁ śataṁ śvanvatīnām |

gandharvapatnīnāṁ śatasyendro api kr̥tac chiraḥ || PS 1.89.2

Slay a hundred Apsarases, a hundred of the dog-accompanied ones. Indra shall cut off the head of a hundred wives of the Gandharvas \(translation by Zehnder et al. 2024\)

Ś3**. ** śatam ahaṁ durṇāmnīnāṁ gandharvāpsarasāṁ śatam |

śataṁ śvanvatīnāṁ śatavāreṇa vāraye || PS 2.27.6 \(~ ŚS 19.36.6\)

A hundred of those with an evil name, a hundred Gandharvas and Apsarases, a hundred of the dog-accompanied ones I repel with the Śatavāra \[amulet\] \(translation by Zehnder et al. 

2024, comment on PS 1.89.2ab\)

Ś4. yāsām ārād āghoṣāmo vātasyeva pr̥thag yataḥ |

tāsāṁ śvanvatīnām indro api kr̥tac chiraḥ ||   PS 7.13.1

Of whom we hear \[the noises\] from afar, as of the wind going in various directions: of those dog-accompanied \[Apsarases\] Indra shall cut off the head \(translation by Griffiths 2009: 383\)

Ś5. yā gachanti janaṁjanam ichantīḥ prayutaṁ bahu |

tāsaṁ śvanvatīnām indro api kr̥tac chiraḥ || PS 7.13.14

Those who go from man to man, easily seeking out the unsuspecting person: of those dog-accompanied \[Apsarases\] Indra shall cut off the head \(translation by Griffiths 2009: 396\) tarikṣe rayanti\) and emend \(following Barret 1930: 67\) to yā antarikṣe ✶ rāyanti ‘Those \(Apsarases\) who bark in the intermediate space’ \(pāda b reads vātena raṣmaṇā saha ‘together with wind and storm’\). I do not read too much into this single pāda, at least insofar as the meaning of śvànvant- is concerned – both the “animal nature” \(Knobl 2009: 197 \[59\]\) and the general noisiness of Apsarases are common tropes in the Atharvaveda \(see Griffiths 2009: 384–385; Lelli 2020: 209\), and indeed they are described as ‘like snorting cows’ \(PS 15.19.10b aghnyāḥ śvasatīr iva\) just two stanzas later.

In addition to these six occurrences of the adjective śvànvant-, we also encounter the aforementioned single attestation of the vr̥ddhi derivative śvāvanta-: Ś7. tasyāṁ vedādhi bheṣajaṁ daśaśīrṣo daśajihvaḥ |

**2 Does ‘Dog’ Mean Dog? **

There are several exocentric compounds in Vedic which contain the word śván- ‘dog’ 

as their first member. Examples include śvaghnín- m., which designates the winner in a game of dice, and which Falk \(1986: 100–101\) derives from the reconstructed 

nomen agentis ✶ śvaghná- ‘dog-killer’, thus meaning literally ‘one who has the dog-killer \[on his side\]’;10 śvápad- m. ‘wild animal’ \(literally ‘having feet like those of a dog, dog-footed’\), its vr̥ddhi derivative śvā́pada- m./n., which according to Selva \(2021: 143–144\) underwent a semantic development from “ravenous \(like a wild 

animal\)” \(in nominal use > “the ravenous one”\) to, in the language of Atharvavedic “yajus-style prose”, “carrion-eating”, from which comes that word’s deadjectival substantive śvā́pada- m./n. “scavenger”; and śvāvídh- m. ‘porcupine’ \(literally ‘dog-piercer’\). The addition of the derivational suffix - vant- to the stem śván- is not an instance of compound formation,11 but it is nonetheless worth asking in this case too: even if the śván- in śvànvant- retains the sense of ‘dog\(s\)’, are dog\(s\) also its referent? 

**10** Falk \(1986: 101\) argues as follows: “Der ‘Hundetöter’ ✶ śvaghná- muß jene Gottheit sein, die für das Gewinnergebnis kṛtá zuständig ist”. 

**11** Griffiths \(2009: 385\) states that the word śvanvatī- \( śvànvant-\) is “to be compared formally with śvanín- ‘dog-leader \(in a hunt\)’ \(found in two parallel mantras i.a. at TS 4.5.4.2, TB 3.4.3.1, VSM 16.27 

and 30.7\)”. However, this meaning for śvanín- presumably follows Renou \(1952: 166 §216\), who marks the term as “glissement pour ✶ śvanī́ . . . ‘qui conduit des chiens’” \(cf. Debrunner and Wackernagel 1930: 278–279 §146c\), rather than understanding the word as śván- \+ possessive suffix 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[197]]

If the -vant- suffix were comparative, it is difficult to see how śván- could refer to anything other than ‘dog’. If we take the more promising course and interpret 

- vant- as possessive, śván- is more likely to denote plural ‘dogs’,12 but beyond this there are a range of possible interpretations. In what follows I distinguish between three of these. Firstly, the word śván- could refer simply to dogs, and so we will need to explore why Apsarases might be accompanied by these animals. Secondly, it may 

refer to dogs the depiction of which alongside the Apsarases is conveyed solely in order to highlight one or other aspect of the latter’s character. In other words, the dogs’ presence may be justified purely by their symbolic value, and so we will need to establish what this value could be in relation to the Apsarases. And thirdly, śván- may refer to an entity or entities other than dogs which are called dogs metaphorically. 

We might differentiate these three alternative readings in the following manner:



– ‘dogs’ as dogs \(as dogs\)



– ‘dogs’ as dogs \(as symbols\)



– ‘dogs’ as symbols

In what follows, I analyse each of these possible interpretations in turn, before going on to explore whether ‘dogs’ could refer, metaphorically, to the Gandharvas. 

One way of making sense of such a metaphor, I contend, is to view the figure of 

the Gandharva alongside related figures from other branches of Indo-European 

mythology, such as the Centaur and the werewolf. I take up the subject of the relat-edness of these figures, and their shared association with dogs, in section §6. 

**3 ‘Dogs’ as Dogs \(as Dogs\)**

Why should Apsarases be accompanied by actual dogs? It is instructive here to turn our attention to the mountainous regions of the Central and Western Himalayas 

and the Hindu Kush. Several of the traditional cultures in these regions worship, or interact otherwise, with fairy-like supernatural beings, some of which display marked similarities \(including an association with dancing and with sexual promiscuity, an ability to shape-shift, and a disposition that veers between benevolent and malign\) with the Vedic Apsaras. In a jointly-authored article on “Fairy lore in 

-ín-. The determinative compound śvanī́- \(with final long ī  replaced by short i, see Debrunner and Wackernagel 1930: 187 §96a\) would not be comparable formally with śvànvant-. 

**12** See Debrunner \(1954: 872 §704 b\) α\)\): “Die häufigste Bedeutung ist ‘mit dem betr. Nominalbegriff versehen’ und zwar meist ‘reichlich versehen’, so daß der zugrunde liegende Nominalbegriff in der Mehrzahl zu denken ist”.

the high mountains of South Asia”, Zoller \(Bhatt, Wessler and Zoller 2014: 88–89\) reports on several of these “fairy-related traditions” and the supernatural beings at the centre of them. Among these beings are the Garhwali ɛ̄ṛi \(Airi\) ‘hunter’,13 a term that refers to both i.\) a male forest deity who roams through the air at night accompanied by fairies \( pari; cf. Avestan pairikā-, Persian parī, peri  etc.\) and dogs; and ii.\) a troupe of female spirits or fairies \(“huntresses”\), also called vanadeviyāṁ 

‘forest goddesses’. Zoller’s description of the male deity paraphrases the account given in Edwin Atkinson’s The Himalayan Gazetteer \(1981 \[first published 1882\]: 825\), which is worth quoting in the original:

He remains concealed during the day, but at night comes forth from the hills and forests and wanders about accompanied by the fairies \( pari\) who join him in dance and song. Their feet are turned backwards, not forwards like those of men. During his rambles, Airi is accompanied by his jhámpánis or litter bearers Sau and Bau14 and a pack of hunting dogs with bells around their necks. Whoever hears the dogs bark is certain to meet with some calamity . . . 

Those who see Airi face to face die of fright at his awful appearance or are burnt up by a flash of his eye, or are torn to pieces by his dogs, or have their livers extracted and eaten by the fairies who accompany him. 

The troupe of female spirits or fairies that Zoller also classifies as ɛ̄ṛi are actually, according to his own account, more commonly referred to by the compound ɛ̄ṛi-

ācharī. The word ācharī- derives from OIA apsarás- \(see Turner 1966: 23\), and the Central Himalayan Ācharī as described by Zoller and others has much in common 

with the Vedic Apsaras: mention may be made here of their extraordinary beauty 

\(Oakley 1905: 212; Bhatt, Wessler and Zoller 2014: 98, 137\), their sexual vora-

ciousness and predilection for young men \(ibid.: 94, 135, 138\), their association with water, trees and the rays of the sun \(ibid.: 98, 149 fn. 202\), their proclivity for dancing \(ibid.: 136\), and their generally frightening and threatening nature \(Traill 1851: 66; Oakley 1905: 212–213\). 

Many of these characteristics are also shared by fairy-like beings in other 

regions of the Central and Western Himalaya and the Hindu Kush. Principal among 

these we can list the Bangani15 Mā̃tri alongside the fairies \( pari, bari, barai\) of **13** Garhwali ɛ̄ṛi  derives from Old Indo-Aryan \(OIA\) ākhēṭa- ‘hunting’, ākhēṭika- ‘huntsman, hunting dog’ \(on which, see Turner 1966: 47\). 

**14** Elsewhere, Zoller \(2017: 86 fn. 205\) suggests that sau “may derive < OIA śauva ‘a multitude or pack of dogs, relating or belonging to dogs, doggish, canine’ \(from śvan ‘dog’\) or < etymologically related śvaka ‘wolf’ . . . and ‘Bau’ may derive < OIA \(lex.\) bhavana ‘dog’.” 

**15** Bangan is a hilly area in Uttarkashi district in northern Uttarakhand. 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[199]]

Nuristan and so-called Dardistan, including the Kalash Súči.16 The Bangani Mā̃tris, which have also been studied by Zoller, present an especially striking case. They live in trees, are fond of dancing, are playful and promiscuous \(according to some, they are the “devadāsī s of the gods”\),17 and they can be seen moving around with black dogs \(Bhatt, Wessler and Zoller 2014: 98–99\). According to Zoller \(ibid.: 99 fn. 

62\), the fact “\[t\]hat fairies in Bangan and Garhwal can be accompanied by dogs . . . 

verifies the huntress nature of fairies in the Central Himalayas.” This is corroborated by the Ācharīs, who are said to hunt at dawn or at midday \(ibid.: 136\), and by the fairy-like beings called bharāṛī-, who are also accompanied by dogs \(ibid.: 148, 156\). These beings hunt humans, mostly young men and women \(ibid.: 138, 147\), 

and according to Zoller it is this that distinguishes fairies in the Central Himalayan region from those further to the west in Nuristan and Dardistan \(ibid.: 99 fn. 62\). 

Although the Súčis, for instance, are intimately linked with human hunters, whom 

they assist and, according to some accounts, enjoy sexual relations with \(Frembgen 1992: 609\), they are depicted as herders rather than hunters,18 and as fundamentally pure and benevolent rather than malicious \(Bhatt, Wessler and Zoller 2014: 94; see also Robertson 1896: 413, and Cacopardo and Cacopardo 1989: 319\). 

Zoller \(Bhatt, Wessler and Zoller 2014: 80\) includes all of these so-called “fairy cults” within the Indo-European “nymph” traditions identified by West \(2007: 284\) as sharing “the belief in a breed of supernatural females who haunt the lonelier 

parts of the land, especially the waters, the trees, and the mountains.” Within this broader compass, we encounter other fairy- or nymph-like beings that are accompanied by dogs – one thinks of the nymphs and dogs that escort Artemis,19 or of 

the Welsh fairies Gwragedd Annwn together with the spectral hounds called cŵn Annwn \(see e.g. Owen 1896: 134; Briggs 1978: 39\). In each of these cases, the presence of dogs is indicative of hunting,20 whether the prey be woodland animals \(in **16** Witzel \(2004: 605\) likens the mountain-dwelling Súčis and their male companions – Kalasha varōti, Kalaṣa-alā \(Waigali\) wötri \(Sanskrit vātaputrī-\) – to the Apsarases and Gandharvas. Note that Śucikā is given as the name of an Apsaras in the Mahābhārata \(MBh 1.114.51a\). 

**17** Cf. the characterisation of the Apsarases as suragaṇikāḥ ‘the courtesans of the gods’ in Māgha’s Śiśupālavadha \(see footnote 31 below\). 

**18** However, see Degener \(2001\) on the key role of the \(Kalaṣa-alā\) female Sučis and male Sučas in the Nuristani hunt, and on these fairies keeping ‘dogs’ \(actually a bear and a leopard\) according to a local story which Degener recounts \(p. 332\). 

**19** See especially the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite 5.117–121 \(see Rayor 2014: 79\) and Callimachus’ 

Hymn to Artemis 13–17 \(Stephens 2015: 109, 117\). Note also that Hecate, closely linked with Artemis – and witchcraft – from an early period \(see e.g. Burkert 1985: 171; Ogden 2021: 36–38\), is also accompanied by dogs. 

**20** Degener \(2001: 331\) claims as follows: “Hunters, the men who roam the mountains and forests and stay there alone, sometimes without meeting other human beings for several days, are – in 

**200**

the case of Artemis and her entourage\) or humans \(as with the Himalayan and 

Welsh fairies\).21

Apsarases are also associated with “the lonelier parts of the land”, especially 

with the waters22 and with trees.23 As Parpola \(1983: 55\) has noted, they are also connected with the “northern mountains” in Sanskrit epic literature.24 With the 

foregoing in mind, if we are to interpret śvànvant- at face value it seems promising to pursue the hypothesis that the Apsarases are accompanied by dogs in the 

Atharvaveda because they are, or because they were in some distant time, like 

their Himalayan cousins such as the Mā̃tris and the Bharāṛīs, linked to hunting, or were themselves hunters. However, although Apsarases are quite often depicted in 

the Atharvaveda as fierce and as threatening to humans,25 and indeed are closely 

associated with forests,26 there is not, to my knowledge, any clear textual evidence in Vedic literature to support the hypothesis that Apsarases were, in any specific sense, hunters. While this lack of textual corroboration does not, to my mind, rule out this reading of śvànvant-, it does leave it unsupported, and so we must move on. 

**4 ‘Dogs’ as Dogs \(as Symbols\)**

It may be that dogs accompany Apsarases in order to exert their symbolic rather 

than their practical value, in which case we need to determine what themes or 

functions dogs represented in ancient India, and which of these might also be pertinent to the Apsarases. Our task is made easier by the existence of several excellent modern studies that to a greater or lesser degree deal with the role and symbol-ism of the dog in early South Asia. Principal among these, Sontheimer \(1984\), Falk \(1986\) and Bollée \(2006\) may be cited. The themes which emerge from these studies which seem most conducive to the present concerns are two: sex and death. 

Nuristan as elsewhere – most likely to experience manifestations of the supernatural world.” 

**21** The cŵn Annwn are associated with the Wild Hunt, especially under the leadership of Gwyn ap Nudd. 

**22** See e.g. RV 9.78.3a; ŚS 2.2.3cd ~ PS 1.7.3cd; PS 1.29.3a; PS 7.13.11ab, 12ab & 13ab \(= PS 15.19.9ab, 10ab & 11ab\); PS 15.18.6b. 

**23** See e.g. PS 1.29.3b; ŚS 4.37.4 ~ PS 12.7.7; ŚS 14.2.9cd ~ PS 18.7.10cd. 

**24** See e.g. MBh 3.155.83a, MBh 6.17.16, MBh 12.319.20. 

**25** See, most pertinently, the stanzas containing the word śvànvant- listed above, as well as the sūkta ŚS 4.37 ~ PS 12.7, and e.g. ŚS 8.5.13 ~ PS 16.28.3. 

**26** See especially PS 1.29.3a, where certain Apsarases are identified as yā vanyā “who belong to the forests” \(Zehnder et al. 2024\). See also ŚS 4.37.4 ~ PS 12.7.7; ŚS 11.9.24 ~ PS 16.30.4–5; ŚS 14.2.9cd ~ 

PS 18.7.10cd. 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[201]]

**4.1 Sex**

It is hardly novel to point out that Apsarases are closely associated with sex. This connection is established already in the Rigveda, for instance when Purūravas 

fondly recalls the times when his lover, the Apsaras Urvaśī, was ‘pierced by my rod day and night’ \( dívā náktaṁ śnathitā́ vaitaséna\).27 In the Atharvaveda, sex with Apsarases is promised as a reward for those who cook the Viṣṭārin rice gruel \(on 

which, see Griffiths 2009: 230–231\): PS 6.22.13ab svarge loke apsarasa enaṁ 28  jāyā 

bhūtvopa śerate ‘as wives the Apsarases lie beside him in the celestial world.’29 

Apsarases are also linked to sex elsewhere in the Veda,30 and in later literature they are depicted as granting sexual rewards to slain warriors, whom they also 

escort, like the Norse Valkyries, from the battlefield to heaven.31 In the Sanskrit epics especially, Apsarases are noted for their sexual prowess and their “legendary promiscuity” \(Oberlies 2012\). The Rāmāyaṇa \(Rām 3.33.16c\), for instance, describes them as krīḍāratividhijñā- “skilled in the sports of lovemaking” \(translation by Pollock in Goldman and Sutherland Goldman 2021: 302\),32 and as sādhāraṇā- \(Rām 1.44.20d\), which means common to or belonging to or shared by all. In the Mahābhārata, the Apsarases Menakā \(MBh 1.68.75\) and Pañcacūḍā \(MBh 13.38.2d\) are both called puṁścalī- ‘whore, slut’. The literary trope of sages being distracted from **27** RV 10.95.4cd. In the following stanza \(RV 10.95.5\), Urvaśi remembers being ‘pierced’ by Purūravas’ ‘rod’ three times a day, even when she was ‘not seeking’ it \( ávyatyai\), and acknowledges that Purūravas was then ‘a hero, the king of my body’ \(5d rā́jā me vīra tanvàs\). 

**28** I take the liberty of rejecting Griffiths’ \(2009: 244–245\) emendation to accusative plural ✶ enāñ 

‘them’, against the unanimous reading of the manuscripts, on the basis of the points made by Thomas Zehnder in his article in the present volume \(see his notes on \# \(39\) R740\). 

**29** On this Paippalāda stanza see Griffiths \(2009: 244–245\), who draws attention earlier \(pp. 233–

234\) to PS 16.96.1, which also appears to offer sex with Apsarases as a reward. The keyword in this second instance is the rare term stráiṇa-, on which Griffiths \(2009: 234\) writes “\[i\]n all Atharvavedic attestations, stráiṇa- ‘women-stuff’ may be taken as referring to sex with women”, glossing the latter word with “Apsarases”. 

**30** See e.g. JB 3.76; JUB 3.25.6–8; PB 12.11.10. 

**31** See especially Hara \(2001\) who cites, among other works, the Mahābhārata, Bhāsa’s Ūrubhaṅga, and Māgha’s Śiśupālavadha. In this latter Mahākāvya, the Apsarases are called suragaṇikāḥ ‘the courtesans of the gods’. I give here the translation of Śiśupālavadha  17.34 by Dundas \(2017: 581\): 

“When heaven’s courtesans heard the thunder of the battle drums, they yearned to possess the warriors slain in combat, putting on long-unused finery suitable for a first passionate encounter.” 

In an endnote, Dundas \(ibid.: 753 n. 9\) points to verse 15.87 from the same work, which he translates as follows \(ibid.: 517\): “Another woman jealously addressed her husband, who was eager for battle: ‘You cheat\! You just want to spend an eternity making love with apsarases in heaven. That’s why you are so pleased to be off\!’”. 

**32** Cf. MBh 14.43.15cd, where it is said that among amorous women, Apsarases are foremost \( ratīnāṁ vasumatyas tu strīṇām apsarasas tathā\). 

**202** 

Robert Leach

their ascetic practices by the sexual allure of Apsarases is already well established in these works.33

In one of his studies of the dog-accompanied hunter deity Mallāri, commonly 

known as Khaṇḍobā in Maharashtra \(the state where his worship is most prevalent 

today\), Sontheimer \(1984: 166\) remarks that “\[t\]he dog is often a metaphor for sexuality and sexual licentiousness”. In his more general study of the dog in ancient India, Bollée \(2006: 85\) concurs: “the dog is often a metaphor for ‘shameless’ sexuality”. The analogy is not unfamiliar to speakers of modern European languages, 

wherein insults to women such as bitch  and chienne, and expressions such as avoir du chien, abound.34 Sontheimer \(1984: 165–166\) notes that “on special occasions” 

the devotees of Mallāri imitate dogs, behaviour which he likens to that practised by the Vedic Vrātyas, the Pāśupatas, and the ancient Greek Cynics \(< Greek κυνικός 

‘dog-like’\). In connection to the latter school of thought, Sontheimer refers to the Greek concept of ‘shamelessness’ \(ἀναίδεια\), a central pillar in the Cynics’ rejection of the conventional mores \(αἰδώς\) of their day, and key to Diogenes’ reappropria-tion of the intended insult κύων ‘dog’ \(see e.g. Long 1996: 35\). The link between dogs and ‘shamelessness’ in ancient Greece is worth mentioning here in light of Wackernagel’s \(1916: 160\) proposal that apsarás- be analysed as privative a- \+ ✶ psáras-, a reconstructed Indo-Iranian word cognate with Avestan fšarǝma- ‘shame’, apsarás- 

thus meaning ‘without shame, shameless’.35 Although not all scholars have found 

this proposal persuasive \(e.g. Mayrhofer 1992: 89 “Nicht überzeugend gedeutet”\), it has garnered some support \(most notably Oberlies 1998: 228–229; see also Wright 

1967: 534\). As Wackernagel himself points out, the Apsaras Menakā is explicitly 

described as ‘shameless’ \( nirapatrapā\) in the Mahābhārata.36

Much of this is suggestive, and it may even be tempting to consider interpreting 

śvànvant- as sharing similar semantic scope with French avoir du chien, but this **33** The tale of the sage Viśvāmitra being distracted by the Apsaras Menakā is one of the better-known stories \(see e.g. MBh 1.66.1–7 and Rām 1.62.4–8\) but there are plenty of other examples \(e.g. the sage Dadhīca being distracted by the Apsaras Alambusā at MBh 9.50.5–9\). 

**34** While in modern English the insult bitch  has come to primarily denote a nasty or malicious woman, its original power as an insult derives from its meaning “\(originally\) a lewd or lascivious woman” \( Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition\) whose behaviour is thought to resemble that of a bitch on heat. This original sense accounts, in turn, for the power of the insult son of a bitch, equivalent to French fils de pute, Spanish hijo de puta etc. French chienne retains a stronger sense of ‘promiscuous woman’ than does modern English bitch. The expression avoir du chien, applied to a woman, denotes something akin to ‘sex appeal’ \(perhaps comparable to modern English fox\), and has quite a distinct history. 

**35** Wackernagel \(1916: 160\) asks: “Sind die Apsarasen, weil verführerisch und sich frei hingebend, als die des Schamgefühls entbehrenden bezeichnet?”. 

**36** See the star passage MBh 1.8.7b✶0225\_01. 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[203]]

reading, or indeed any reading of our epithet which foregrounds the Apsarases’ 

sexuality, must remain highly speculative, not least because the evidence connecting dogs with sex in Vedic literature is in fact substantially weaker than might be hoped for. 

**4.2 Death**

The Atharvaveda, more than any other text, focuses on the malevolent, hostile 

nature of Apsarases.37 In the sūktas containing the first two instances of śvànvant- listed above \(Ś1. & Ś2.\), they are associated with the deadly disease called yákṣma- \(probably tuberculosis, see Zysk 1996: 12–17\). Elsewhere, it is revealed that they kill humans directly \(e.g. ŚS 8.5.13a ~ PS 16.28.3a; PS 7.11.3\), and as Griffiths \(2009: 383\) has observed, there are “thematic and verbatim correspondences” 

in the Paippalāda-Saṁhitā between Apsarases and female demonic beings such as 

the Sadānvās and the Kaṇvās. Together with the Gandharvas, they are also listed 

alongside demonic beings such as the Arāyas, the Kimīdins, the Piśācas and the 

Rakṣases \(ŚS 12.1.50 ~ PS 17.5.8\). In Ś1. listed above, dog-accompanied Apsarases are said to approach from the south, or from below \( adhara-\), a direction which represents the realm of Yama and the dead ancestors \( pitŕ̥-\).38 Apsarases are also linked to Yama elsewhere in the Atharvaveda \(e.g. PS 5.17.8; PS 17.24.10\), while the Rigveda contains a fairly clear hint that an Apsaras \(referred to merely as ápyā . . . 

yóṣā\) is, along with ‘the Gandharva in the waters’, a near ancestor \(possibly the mother?\) of Yama and his twin sister Yamī.39 In every stanza listed above wherein the epithet śvànvant- occurs, Apsarases are depicted as threatening. Might the dogs that accompany them be an external representation of this threat? 

There is certainly ample testimony in Vedic literature that dogs are associated 

with death. This association is established already in the Rigveda \(RV 10.14.10–12\), when ‘the two dogs of Saramā’s breed’ \( sārameyáu śvā́nau, 10a\), later called Śabala and Śyāma \(see e.g. ŚS 8.1.9a ~ PS 16.1.9a\), are introduced as the guardians \( rakṣitŕ̥-, 11a\) and messengers \( dūtá-, 12b\) of Yama, king of the realm of the dead.40 Falk \(1986: 109\) and Bollée \(2006: 80\) adduce further passages from \(post-Rigvedic\) 

**37** Indeed, these facets of their character are often not mentioned at all in other texts. 

**38** See Zehnder et al. \(2024\) on PS 1.59.5c and PS 1.104.1b. 

**39** RV 10.10.4c: gandharvó apsv ápyā ca yóṣā . . .  Jamison and Brereton \(2014: 1382\) translate: “The Gandharva in the waters and the watery maiden”. Cf. RV 10.95.10b, where Purūravas calls the Apsaras Urvaśī ‘the watery one’ \( ápyā\). 

**40** Bloomfield \(1893: 169\) calls Yama’s dogs “destructive agents of death”. As the guardians of Yama’s realm, they correspond to Cerberus. 

**204** 

Robert Leach

Vedic literature wherein dogs clearly represent death, and indeed this association is not limited to South Asian literary sources but is found across multiple Indo-European traditions.41 This widespread link between dogs and death is undoubtedly 

complex in origin and nature, but a striking and persistent concern in ancient 

Indian literature, as for instance in ancient Greek literature and European Renaissance painting,42 is of dogs as scavengers \(thus śvā́pada-, see §2 above\) and, in particular, as eaters of human corpses. We encounter representations of this theme 

in the Mahābhārata in particular,43 but also in the Atharvaveda.44 If murderous Apsarases leave human corpses in their wake, it would make good sense for dogs 

to accompany them. 

In sum, even if we disregard the immediate contexts of the six occurrences of 

the epithet śvànvant- listed above, in the Vedic setting death in the shape of dogs appears to have greater symbolic currency than does sex. 

**5 ‘Dogs’ as Symbols**

As alluded to above \(§2\), it is not uncommon in Vedic literature for the word śván- 

‘dog’ to be attributed to beings or entities other than dogs. In a somewhat speculative discussion on canine terminology in the ancient Indian dice game, Falk \(1986: 108–111\) suggests that the losing result, called káli-, where a single Vibhīdaka nut \( ákṣa-\) is left over, was also understood as the ‘dog’ \(hence the term śvaghnín-, see §2 above\). This persuades Griffiths \(2009: 383\) that the dog-accompanied Apsarases in PS 7.13 \(see stanzas Ś4. and Ś5. listed above\) are “probably those 

Apsarases which were thought to be involved in a bad outcome of the dice-game”. 

Although Apsarases are certainly associated with the game of dice,45 and although an indirect connection with dice might be apposite here \(see §6.2 below\), I do not find this proposal persuasive, at least when framed in this way. Not only would it counter the norm for possessive - vant- \(i.e. that the nominal stem is understood as a plural, see footnote 12\), it would also not conform to the way in which Apsarases’ 

involvement with the game of dice is represented elsewhere in the Atharvaveda. 

Apsarases are described as akṣákāma- ‘fond of dice’ \(ŚS 2.2.5b ~ PS 1.7.5b\). In a **41** See especially Schlerath \(1954\), Kershaw \(2000: 428–430\), and Anthony and Brown \(2017: 146\).

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[205]]

Śaunaka sūkta \(ŚS 4.38\) that is used by the Kauśikasūtra \(KauśS 41.13\) for success in the dice game \(Whitney and Lanman 1905: 214\), the Apsaras is invoked for victory 

and is characterised as sādhudevín- ‘playing successfully’ \(1b, 2b\), as ‘delighting in dice’ \(4a akṣéṣu pramódante\), and as able to ensure the winning result \( kr̥tá-\) in the gláha- ‘grip, portion \(of Vibhīdaka nuts grabbed by each player\)’ \(1c\). The ability of Apsarases to determine the outcome of a game is also depicted in another Atharvavedic sūkta, the speaker of which implores as follows: “Let them \(Apsarases\) 

unite our hand with the winning result. Let them make the rival player succomb to us” \(translation by Zehnder, Leach and Hellwig, Paippalāda Recension of the Atharvaveda, Online Edition\).46 While it is true that in ensuring victory for one side, the Apsarases are inevitably involved in a “bad outcome” for the other, Atharvavedic 

poets never occupy this vantage point. They only speak from the perspective of 

victory \(and in one instance, contrition at any kílbiṣāni ‘offences’ that may have occurred\).47

Elsewhere, Bloomfield \(1893: 163–172\) presents the striking examples of the 

sun and the moon, each of which are referred to as dogs: in the Atharvaveda the sun is called ‘the celestial dog’ \( śúno divyásya, ŚS 6.80.1, 3 ~ PS 19.16.12–13; śvā divyaḥ, PS 15.18.8\), and the same designation is applied to the moon at e.g. ŚBM 11.1.5.1; elsewhere, sun and moon together are called ‘the dogs of Yama’ \( yamaśvā́, e.g. MS 

1.6.9:100.17\). Might the sun be the singular ‘dog’ that accompanies the Apsarases? 

Stanzas such as PS 7.13.2, PS 15.18.7 and ŚS 4.38.5 might suggest that this is a possibility. The former, which immediately succeeds Ś4. listed above, is translated by Griffiths \(2009: 386\) thus: “They who approach from the East, together with the rays of the sun: \(of those dog-accompanied \[Apsarases\] Indra shall cut off the head\)”.48 

PS 15.18.7 implores two Apsarases to “dance away into the distance, together with the dappled dog” \(translation by Lelli 2020: 200\). Lelli \(ibid.\) concurs with Griffiths \(2009: 385\), who suggests that the “dappled dog” \( sāraṅgeṇa śunā\) here is the sun. 

Finally, ŚS 4.38.5ab reads as follows: sū́ryasya raśmī́n ánu yā́ḥ saṁcáranti márīcīr vā yā́ anusaṁcáranti ‘Those \[Apsarases\] that travel along the rays of the sun, or those that travel along its beams . . . ’.49 How convincing is it that Apsarases would **46** PS 4.9.5cd: tā no hastau kr̥tena saṁ sr̥jantu sapatnaṁ naḥ kitavaṁ randayantu.  In place of PS 

kr̥tena ‘with the winning result’, the parallel ŚS 7.109.3c reads ghr̥téna ‘with ghee’, which Zehnder, Leach and Hellwig \(Paippalāda Recension of the Atharvaveda, Online Edition, comment on PS 

4.5.9c\) explain as a perseveration from ŚS 7.109.1c. 

**47** See ŚS 6.118.1–2 ~ PS 16.50.3–4. Cf. also TB 3.7.12.3. 

**48** PS 7.13.2 \(= PS 15.19.2\): yāḥ purastād ācaranti sākaṁ sūryasya raśmibhiḥ \( tāsaṁ śvanvatīnām indro api kr̥tac chiraḥ\). 

**49** It is worth bearing in mind here that, according to at least one ancient Indian hydrological theory, water on earth is absorbed by the sun’s rays and travels upwards towards the sun before being released, also via the sun’s rays, as rain \(see Zehnder et al. 2024, comment on PS 1.2.2ab\). In other 

**206** 

Robert Leach

be given an epithet which means ‘accompanied by the sun’? Of course, such an 

interpretation would also counter the norm for possessive - vant- \(again, see footnote 12\). Semantically, it also seems a little odd. Apsarases may accompany the sun, but would it really be said that the sun accompanies Apsarases? It should be noted that Apsarases do not come only from the east with the sun. At PS 1.29.1ab, the verse immediately prior to that quoted above as Ś1., they are described as coming from the east and down from \(i.e. away from\) the sun \( nīcaiḥ sūryāt\). What is more, they are also depicted as coming from the other three cardinal directions \(see e.g. 

PS 15.19.3–5\). Indeed, in Ś1. above, it is explicitly stated that dog-accompanied Apsarases come from the south, or from below \( adhara-\), an image which, as mentioned above, evokes the realm of Yama. At PS 15.19.4, the Apsarases that approach from the west are said to come “together with blind darkness” \( andhena tamasā 

saha, translation by Lelli 2020: 205\), which suggests the very absence of the sun. 

In light of such discrepancies, I want to explore instead whether it is plausible that the ‘dogs’ that accompany the Apsarases might be beings that are proximate 

to the sun, and indeed to most of the themes discussed thus far, and which are, 

after all, the Apsarases’ most natural companions, namely the Gandharvas. The 

Gandharvas are not actual dogs, and so strictly speaking they belong in the present section of this article \(‘Dogs’ as symbols\), but because I attempt to enquire into their dog-like character in greater depth than I have attempted with the themes 

addressed above, they deserve a section of their own. 

**6 Gandharvas**

Given the intimate relation between Apsarases and Gandharvas, it is not altogether surprising that many of the themes advanced thus far are also closely linked to 

the complex figure of the Gandharva. As with the Apsarases there are not, to my 

knowledge, explicit descriptions of the Gandharvas as hunters, but their close 

association with weaponry,50 and especially with the practice of archery,51 is possibly suggestive. More appreciably, they are, like Apsarases, well known for their sexual voraciousness. Already in the wedding hymn of the Rigveda \(RV 10.85\), the 

Gandharva Viśvāvasu is pleaded with to ‘seek some other girl, \[an unmarried one\] 

words, accustomed as they are to a watery habitat, Apsarases will not be out of place travelling along the sun’s rays. 

**50** See already RV 10.123.7. 

**51** See e.g. TS 3.4.7.11; ŚBM 3.3.311 and TĀ 1.9.3 \(where the legendary archer Kr̥śānu is identified as a Gandharva\); MBh 1.158.6–23; MBh 4.22.13–14. 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[207]]

who \[still\] lives with her father . . . seek some other budding young girl’ i.e. rather than the just-married one he is pursuing \(this plea re-emerges in both Atharvaveda Saṁhitās\).52 Gandharvas are strī́kāma- ‘desirous of women’ \(MS 3.7.3:77.16; TS 

6.1.6.5; AB 1.27\), yośítkāma- ‘desirous of girls’ \(ŚBM 3.2.4.3, ŚBM 3.9.3.20\),  strī́bhāga 

‘enjoyers \(or sharers?\) of women’ \(ŚS 8.6.19c ~ PS 16.80.10c\),53 and are frequently associated with sex and virility.54 They are also closely associated with death, 

not least through the singular Gandharva’s involvement as progenitor \(with “the 

watery maiden”, see §4.2\) of the twin mortals Yama and Yamī \(RV 10.10.4\). In the 

Paippalāda-Saṁhitā \(17.24.10\), the Gandharvas and Apsarases are the parents 

of Sleep \( svapna-\), called ‘Yama’s helper’ \( yamasya karaṇaḥ\), while in the Taittirīya-Saṁhitā \(3.4.7.8, 11\), Death \( mr̥tyú-\) is explicitly identified as a Gandharva. 

Also like the Apsarases, they are a direct threat to humans, whom they sometimes 

kill, especially in the Atharvaveda.55 They are less directly connected to the game of dice than are Apsarases,56 but are very strongly associated with the sun, with which they are often identified, on occasion in the same breath that Apsarases are identified with its rays.57 Gandharvas and Apsarases are, then, compatible spouses.58

Of all of the motifs I have discussed thus far, hunting, death and the sun have 

the strongest associations with dogs in Vedic literature. Gandharvas also have especially strong links with death and with the sun \(as well as with sex\). Given these **52** RV 10.85.21c, 22c: anyā́m iccha pitr̥ṣádam . . . anyā́m iccha prapharvyàm. The Paippalāda parallel to the first of these stanzas \(RV 10.85.21\) is at PS 18.10.3 while the Śaunaka version at ŚS 14.2.33 

combines RV 10.85.22ab with RV 10.85.21cd. In the Atharvaveda, the plea for the Gandharva to depart lasts a further three stanzas \(PS 18.10.4–6 ~ ŚS 14.2.34–36\). 

**53** Cf. ŚS, PS hutábhāga- ‘enjoying, partaking of \(sharing in\) oblations’. 

**54** The Rāmāyaṇa \(Rām 4.42.50\) tells us that Gandharvas, along with certain other beings, are 

‘wholly devoted to sexual pleasure’ \( ratiparāyaṇa-\). Later, we learn \(in the translation of Goldman and Sutherland Goldman 2021: 420\) that “intense desire is natural for gandharvas” \(Rām 4.58.9a: tīkṣṇakāmās tu gandharvāḥ\). In the Atharvaveda \(ŚS 4.4.1 ~ PS 4.5.1\) it is told that the Gandharva provided a cure \( óṣadhiṁ śepahárṣaṇīm ‘a penis-erecting plant’\) for Varuṇa’s erectile disfunction. 

At ŚS 4.37.7 ~ PS 12.7.9, an attempt to neutralize a threatening Gandharva involves castrating him. 

See also e.g. TS 5.7.15 and PB 19.3.2, and for further references Oberlies \(2005: 106–107\). 

**55** See e.g. ŚS 8.5.13 ~ PS 16.28.3; and ŚS 8.6.19 ~ PS 16.80.10, where Gandharvas are said to kill newborn babies. 

**56** However, see ŚS 7.109.5 ~ PS 4.9.4, where a gambler wishes to mark success in the dice game by feasting with the Gandharvas. See also, Mayrhofer \(1992: 323\) s.v. kalí-, and Norelius \(2015: 41\). 

**57** For identifications between the figure of the Gandharva and the sun, see e.g. RV 10.123 and ŚBM 6.3.1.19. See also the description of the Gandharva as sū́ryatvac- ‘sun-skinned’ at ŚS 2.2.2a ~ PS 

1.7.2a. The Baudhāyana-Śrautasūtra \(BaudhŚS 18.46\) mentions a Gandharva named Sūryavarcas \(‘having the splendour of the sun’\), who is also named elsewhere. The Gandharva is depicted as the sun, and the Apsarases its rays, at e.g. TS 3.4.7.2 and ŚBM 9.4.1.8. 

**58** Apsarases are identified as the wives of Gandharvas at e.g. PS 1.7.5c, ŚS 4.37.12a ~ PS 12.8.2a, and PS 1.89.2c. 

**208** 

Robert Leach

links, and given that Gandharvas are, arguably, by far the most natural companions for the Apsarases, the question unavoidably presents itself: can the Gandharvas be understood as ‘dogs’? How dog-like are they? It is these questions which will occupy much of the remainder of this article. 

The obvious opening move is to point out that that the Gandharva is indeed 

explicitly identified as taking on the form of a dog in the Atharvaveda, the very text which describes the Apsarases as śvànvatī- ‘dog-accompanied’. I give the text and translation as presented by Hellwig, Leach and Zehnder \( Paippalāda Recension of the Atharvaveda, Online Edition\):

śvetīkr̥ṇvānaḥ puruṣaṁ viśvā rūpāṇi bobhuvat |

śvevaikaṁ kapir ivaikaṁ kumāraḥ sarvakeśakaḥ |

priyo dr̥śe bhūtvā gandharvaḥ sacate striyaṁ tam ito nāśayāmasi || PS 12.8.6 \(~ ŚS 4.37.11\) Turning man white, successively assuming all forms: one like a dog, one like a monkey,59 \[and one like\] a youth with a full head of hair – having become nice to look at, Gandharva pursues women. We make him disappear from here. 

This verse belongs to a sūkta \(consisting of two kaṇḍikās in the PS, PS 12.7 and PS 

12.8\) that is concerned with driving away demonic \(see PS 12.7.1–2 ~ ŚS 4.37.1–2\) Gandharvas and Apsarases who constitute a threat to the speaker and his companions. In this sense it addresses a very similar theme and is spoken from the very same vantage point as each of the sūktas that contain the epithet śvànvatī-. In the Śaunaka version of this sūkta, shortly before the above verse, the Gandharvas are twice described as haviradá- ‘libation-eating’ \(ŚS 4.37.8c, 9c\).60 In the proper course of events, the eaters of libations are the gods \( devá-\), as is repeatedly described in the Rigveda.61 However, the Gandharvas are not mere substitutes for the gods here, since their eating of the libations is far from welcome – indeed, it is asked that **59** “One like a monkey”: The monkey \( kapí-\), like the Gandharva, is renowned in South Asia for its libidinous character \(the literary beginnings of this trope are at RV 10.86\). There are also notable links between Gandharvas \(and Apsarases\) and monkeys in the Sanskrit epics. In the Mahābhārata \(3.147.22\), for instance, Vaiśaṁpāyana asks the semi-divine monkey Hanumān whether he is a Gandharva. In the Rāmāyaṇa \(Rām 4.37.29ab\), the Vānaras, the troop to which Hanumān belongs, are identified as the sons of gods and Gandharvas. Elsewhere in the Rāmāyaṇa \(Rām 4.65.8–10\), the Apsaras Puñjikasthalā, also known as Añjanā, is described as a shape-shifter \( kāmarūpiṇī-\) who has turned into a monkey \( kapi-\). 

**60** On this term, which does not fit the metre, see Hellwig, Leach and Zehnder \(2024\) on PS 12.8.3c. 

**61** See the use of the nominal form havirádya- at RV 1.163.9c, RV 5.1.11d, RV 5.4.4d, and RV 7.11.5ab. 

At RV 10.15.8–10, it is Yama and the ancestors \( pitr̥-\) that are described as ‘libation-eating’ \( havirád-\).

Indra push them away \(8d, 9d: vy r̥ṣ\). The other creature that is notorious in ancient Indian literature for uninvitedly eating sacrificial oblations is of course the dog.62

There are, in addition, several other characteristics shared by Gandhar-

vas and dogs. In an Atharvavedic sūkta \(ŚS 8.6 ~ PS 16.79–81\) concerned with 

protecting a pregnant woman from attacks by demons, the Gandharvas are 

depicted, in common with other demonic beings, as killing embryos or fetuses 

\( gárbha-\) and newborn babies \(ŚS 8.6.18–19 ~ PS 16.80.9–10\). It is presumably also the Gandharvas who are described a few lines later as follows: ŚS 8.6.23abc 

\(~ PS 16.81.5abc\) yá āmáṁ mā́ṁsam adanti páuruṣeyaṁ ca yé kravíḥ | gárbhān khā́danti keśavā́ḥ . . . ‘The hairy ones that eat raw flesh and human carrion, that feed upon embryos \(or fetuses\) . . . ’63 I have referred above \(§4.2\) to dogs’ 

predilection for necrophagy, and especially for human corpses. A passage in the 

Mahābhārata \(MBh 3.219.33–38\) describes how Saramā, ‘mother of dogs’, along with the mother of the Gandharvas and the mother of the Apsarases all seize 

human fetuses from inside their mother’s wombs. Gandharvas are further linked 

to anthropophagy through characters in the Sanskrit epics such as Virādha 

\(described as puruṣāda- ‘man-eating’ at Rām 3.2.4d\) and Kabandha.64 Elsewhere in the Rāmāyaṇa  it is related that the Rākṣasa woman \( rākṣasī-\) called Saramā 

\(namesake of Indra’s dog\) is the daughter of the Gandharva king Śailūṣa \(Rām 

7.12.22\). In Vedic literature, the Gandharva arguably exhibits further dog-like 

traits: he is a protector and guardian \(of soma in particular, see especially Kuiper 1996 and Oberlies 2005\); as a group, the Gandharvas undertake a nocturnal raid 

to steal Urvaśī’s lambs \(ŚBM 11.5.1.1–4\); they are quite often associated with the action of licking \( rih\).65 However, I intend to scrutinize the dog-like nature of the Gandharvas from another angle, and to approach this angle by revisiting an old 

controversy. 

**62** See e.g. RV 9.101.1, 13; JB 1.353; MBh 2.34.19cd, MBh 3.253.19–20, MBh 12.15.45ab; Rām 6.26.26. 

**63** Wijesekera \(1994 \[first published 1945\]: 182\) writes of this verse: “\[i\]t is also certain that the gandharvas  are meant”. 

**64** Virādha is identified as the Gandharva Tumburu at Rām 3.3.18. The man-eating Kabandha \(see especially Rām 3.65.22–26\) is identified as the Gandharva Viśvāvasu at MBh 3.263.38. They are also both together identified as Gandharvas in the Harivaṁśa \(HV 31.119\). See also e.g. MBh 1.59.5, where Gandharvas are named, alongside other beings, as ‘man-eaters’ \( puruṣāda-\).

**6.1 Gandharvas and Centaurs**

The long-standing debate on the connections between Gandharvas and Centaurs 

was initiated by Adalbert Kuhn’s \(1852\) postulation of an etymological link between Vedic gandharvá- and Greek κένταυρος and his accompanying discussion of the similarities between these two figures from a mythological perspective.66 Kuhn’s 

proposed etymological link has since been roundly rejected by scholars \(see 

Kulikov 2021: 164–165\), the consensus for some time being that both words are 

without an Indo-European etymology, shared or otherwise. Kulikov \(2018; 2021\) 

has recently reignited the debate by suggesting a common non-Indo-European 

origin for both terms. Pointing to the “abundance of hybrid half-animal creatures in Kassite mythology” \(Kulikov 2018: 60; 2021: 175\), apparent borrowings from 

Indo-Iranian in the sparsely attested Kassite lexicon,67 and Kassite mythology as one of the “possible sources of the Centaurs” \(2018: 60; 2021: 174\), Kulikov suggests that this common origin may be the Kassite language. More pertinent to the present discussion, in agreement with Kuhn \(1852\), Dumézil \(1929\) and others, and in opposition to West’s \(2007: 285 fn. 14\) claim that the Centaurs and Gandharvas “have 

virtually nothing in common mythologically”, Kulikov \(2021: 166–171\) affirms mul-

tiple shared characteristics between the two mythical figures, which he lists and describes under the following headings:



Shape-shifting and hybrid or theriomorphic nature



\(Semi-\)equinal nature



Hypersexuality and lustfulness



Aquatic nature and association with water



Connection with alcoholic or intoxicating drinks



Expertise in healing plants



Musical skills

This list of commonalities between Gandharvas and Centaurs can be constructively 

elaborated upon and expanded. For instance, under “Hypersexuality and lustful-

ness” references could be added to, on the one hand, ŚāṅkhGS 1.19.2 \(~ KauṣGS 

1.12.2\), which directs a newly-wed husband to touch his wife’s vulva and to address it with the words ‘You are the mouth of the Gandharva Viśvāvasu’ \( gandharvasya viśvāvasor mukham asi\); and on the other, fragment 92 of the Athenian comic play-66 Kuhn’s approach was taken up by Dumézil \(1929\) among others. 

**67** Kulikov \(2018, 60\) refers to “numerous Kassite names borrowed from Indo-Iranian \(or Indo-Aryan\)”, adapting this claim in his later publication to “a few Kassite names presumably borrowed from Indo-Iranian” \(2021: 175\). No references are given for this borrowing, but see e.g. Sassmannshausen \(2014\). 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas

wright Theopompus, wherein the vagina is referred to as κένταυρος \(see Storey 

2011: 352–353\).68 Under “Aquatic nature and association with water”, it could be 

pointed out that Cheiron, unquestionably the best-known Centaur if a markedly 

atypical one, is not only the child of an Oceanid, as Kulikov \(2021: 170\) reports, but is also married to a Naiad \(a freshwater nymph, named Chariclo\), just as the Gandharvas are husbands to the water-dwelling Apsarases. Moreover, further “shared char-

acteristics” can be added to the above list. For instance, as noted already by Kuhn \(1852: 531–532, 537\), the Centaur Cheiron as well as certain Gandharvas including Viśvāvasu, Citraratha and Citrasena, are depicted as teachers of young heroes: in the case of the Gandharvas their heroic pupil is Arjuna;69 in the case of Cheiron, his notable former students include Jason, Odysseus, Achilles, Actaeon, Asclepius and Aeneas.70 In the Sanskrit epics especially, Gandharvas are described, just like the Centaurs, as having their homes in the mountains.71 Centaurs are also depicted as eaters of raw flesh \(e.g. Apollodorus’ Bibliotheca 2.5.4\) and are associated with cannibalism, or rather anthropophagy \(Bremmer 2002: 146–147\). Bremmer \(2012: 29\) 

notes that “Centaur names recur as the names of dogs already in the Archaic age”. 

Especially striking, and apparently overlooked by scholars thus far,72 is that 

Gandharvas and Centaurs both play a very specific role as potential or actual 

violent aggressors towards the bridal party at weddings. In the wedding hymn ŚS 

14.2 ~ PS 18.7–18.14, a few verses after the Gandharva Viśvāvasu has been pleaded **68** Bremmer \(2012: 34\) remarks: “even the vagina was called ‘Centaur’ in ancient comedy as it roused sexual lust”. 

**69** According to MBh 3.89.13, Arjuna learnt from Viśvāvasu the arts of song \( gīta-\), dance \( nr̥tta-\), melody \( sāman-\) and the playing of musical instruments \( vāditra-\), collectively called gāndharvaṁ 

vedam ‘the Gandharva knowledge’. At MBh 1.158.38–44, Citraratha transmits to Arjuna the knowledge \( vidyā-\) called ‘vision’ \( cakṣus-\) which seems to be a form of clairvoyance or remote viewing. 

At MBh 3.235.6, Arjuna is identified as the pupil \( śiṣya-\) of Citrasena \(see also MBh 3.164.54\). 

**70** For references, see Bremmer \(2012: 33\). Cheiron is depicted as having taught medicine to Asclepius \(not mentioned in Bremmer’s list\) in e.g. Homer’s Iliad \(4.219\) and Pindar’s Third Nemean Ode \(54–55\). 

**71** Bremmer \(2012: 43\) calls Centaurs “demons of the mountain wilderness”, and remarks that 

“the mountains functioned as a kind of ‘liminal space’ between the civilised world and the world outside Greek civilisation”. Gandharvas are described as living in the northern mountains at e.g. 

MBh 2.25.5–6, MBh 3.140.5 and MBh 3.155.83. It is perhaps worth noting here that Ctesias’ famous Cynocephaloi \(‘dog-headed people’\), characterised as hunters who are greatly skilled with weaponry, who eat animal flesh and wear animal hides, and who occupy a liminal space between “human and animal, civilized and savage” \(Nichols 2011: 124\), are also located in the northern mountains. 

For these descriptions, see Nichols \(2011: 53–55\). 

**72** This is despite the fact that several of the scholars \(e.g. Kuhn 1852: 537–538; Dumézil 1929: 175–177\) who have discussed the apparent links between Gandharvas and Centaurs have explicitly referred to the Lapiths.

with to seek another girl \(specifically, one who is unmarried, see §6.\), the Gandharvas and Apsarases who watch the wedding procession go by from their perches in 

the trees are entreated not to injure the bridal party: ‘May they be well-disposed towards this bride, may they not harm the bridal procession as it passes by\!’73 In response to the stanza in which this line occurs, Vasilkov \(1989–1990: 394–395\) 

observes the following:

\[T\]he mention of the Apsarases and Gandharvas hiding in the trees and threatening to attack the marriage procession reminds us of a custom known to many Indo-European peoples, the Balts in particular: unmarried boys from the bridegroom’s age-group attack the marriage feast, feigning the “kidnapping” of the bride.74

As with ancient Indian literature,75 Greek and Latin literature abounds in mythi-

cal tales of bridal abduction,76 and it also contains references to mock abductions at weddings.77 Several scholars have suggested that the latter were modelled on 

the former, in other words that the ritualised \(‘mock’\) abduction \(or residual elements thereof\) that appears to have sometimes formed part of the marriage cer-

emony took a mythical abduction as its prototype.78 Indeed, this view itself goes back to antiquity – the Roman grammarian Festus \(c. 2nd century CE\) claims that 

the mock abduction of the bride \( rapi simulatur virgo\) at her wedding is performed in honour of Romulus, under whose leadership the famous rape \(abduction\) of the 

Sabines was conducted \(Lindsay 1913: 364–365; see also Hersch 2010: 145\). 

The attempted abduction of Hippodameia, bride of Peirithous, at their wedding 

feast in Thessaly by the inebriated Centaur Eurytion, and the violent battle that ensues \(the so-called Centauromachy\) between the drunken Centaurs and the 

**73** SS 14.2.9ef \(~ PS 18.7.10ef\):  syonā́s te asyái vadhvài bhavantu mā́ hiṁsiṣur vahatúm uhyámānam. 

**74** As we will see below, Vasilkov proposes that the role of the Gandharvas in this marriage rite is taken on by the unmarried boys of the “men’s house” \( sabhā́-\). 

**75** On ‘abduction marriage’ \( rākṣasa-\) in ancient Indian law, ritual and myth \(as well as on its numerous Greek analogues\), see especially Jamison \(1994; 1996: 218–235\). 

**76** It should be noted that the Centaur Cheiron plays a role in two of the best known of these abductions: that of Cyrene by Apollo, and that of Thetis by Peleus, both as told by Pindar, respectively in the Ninth Pythian Ode \(29–66\) and the Fourth Nemean Ode \(61–62\). 

**77** See especially Plutarch Lycurgus 15 \(see Talbert 2005: 18–19\). Cartledge \(2004: 171\) remarks that the Spartan marriage ceremony “began with a rape – normally a purely symbolic and ritualized rape, no doubt”. Redfield \(1982: 191\) observes: “Virginity is precious and is not abandoned voluntarily. Hence the elements in the wedding ceremony which imply that the wedding is after all a rape, in particular the thurōros, the doorkeeper \(mentioned by Sappho\) who, as Pollux tells us \(3.42\) ‘roars at the women trying to rescue the bride.’” On mock abductions at weddings in other parts of ancient Greece, see Sourvinou-Inwood \(1973\) and Jenkins \(1983\).

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[213]]

Lapiths does not follow the typical pattern of Greek bridal abductions. To begin 

with, the earliest extant version of the story does not take place at a wedding at all, but simply in Peirithous’ home where Eurytion is a guest, and what is more, there is no mention of an abduction.79 Secondly, in the canonical version of the story such as is found, for example, in Ovid and in the Bibliotheca  of Apollodorus,80 Eurytion’s attempted abduction of Hippodameia takes place at her wedding \(as opposed to in 

advance of it\) but is clearly not a ‘mock abduction’ as wedding abductions usually are.81 And thirdly, the abduction fails, and many of the Centaurs, including Eurytion, are killed. 

The Centauromachy usefully highlights several characteristics which the Cen-

taurs share with the Gandharvas. Here we may cite their “hypersexuality and lust-

fulness” \(encouraged by Eurytion’s actions and the wine they have consumed, his 

Centaur companions proceed to sieze other girls at the marriage feast\), and their connection with alcohol or intoxication. Their use of trees or branches as weapons is also worthy of note here. Depictions of the Centaurs armed against the Lapiths in this way can be found in e.g. Pindar \(F 166\), Ovid \( Metamorphoses  12.327\) and Apollodorus \( Bibliotheca  3.11.22\), and are especially vivid in pictorial representations from the 6th century BCE Attic François Vase to Renaissance painting and beyond.82 

This motif is also common in South Asia: in general, the ability to uproot trees signifies superhuman strength in early Sanskrit literature.83 The use of uprooted trees as weapons is attributed to Rāvaṇa among other demons,84 but it is especially associated with the forest-dwelling, shape-shifting, honey wine-loving,85 theriomor-

phic monkey warriors \( vānara-\) who assist Rāma in his retrieval of his abducted wife Sītā in the Rāmāyaṇa.86 It is also ascribed to Bhīma in the Mahābhārata, in a **79** Homer Odyssey  21.295–299. In Lattimore’s \(1991: 316–317\) translation, Eurytion simply “went wild with drinking” and “did much harm in the house of Peirithoös”. Cf. Pindar Fragment 166 

\(Sandys 1915: 600–603\). 

**80** Ovid Metamorphoses 12.210–535; Bibliotheca 3.11.21–22. See also Pausanias 5.10.8. 

**81** In other words, it is therefore of a different nature to other mythical abductions of brides, such as Hades’ abduction of Persephone, or the Dioscuri’s abduction of the Leucippides, or Apollo’s abduction of Cyrene etc., all of which take place before \(in anticipation of\) the marriage ceremony, as well as to ‘mock abductions’ which are reported \(by Plutarch etc.\) as actually taking place at weddings. 

**82** See especially Piero di Cosimo’s The Fight Between the Lapiths and the Centaurs \(National Gal-lery, London\). 

**83** It is attributed, for example, to Kr̥ṣṇa as a baby in the Harivaṁśa \(HV 51.16–18\). 

**84** See e.g. Rām 7.21.21. Rāvaṇa’s brother Kumbhakarṇa also uproots a tree and arms himself with it at e.g. Rām 6.55.14. 

**85** See Rām 5.59.11–60.26 for an account of the monkeys becoming drunk – and violent – on honey wine \( madhu-\). 

**86** See e.g. Rām 4.16.21; 5.42.11; 6.57.66; 6.63.31; 6.84.7–18; 6.85.12. 

**214**

short episode in which he rescues his abducted wife Draupadī. In the passage MBh 

4.22.15–24, Bhīma is repeatedly called a Gandharva, and is described as having ‘the desire to kill’ \( jighāṁsā-, 17b\), as being like a raging lion \( siṁham iva, 21a\), and like death \( antakam iva, 22a\), and as striking terror into Draupadī’s assailants, who call out in alarm ‘A mighty Gandharva is coming, furious and brandishing a tree\!’ 

\( gandharvo balavān eti kruddha udyamya pādapam, 23ab\). 

The word that is used to identify the Vānaras, the brotherhood of monkey war-

riors87 who are Rāma’s allies in the Rāmāyaṇa, as ‘shape-shifters’ is kāmarūpin- 

‘adopting \[any\] shape at will’.88 It is surely not incidental that they are distinguished as such in the following manner: ‘The Vānaras are the sons of Gods and 

Gandharvas, and can assume \[any\] shape at will’ \( devagandharvaputrāś ca vānarāḥ 

kāmarūpiṇaḥ, Rām 4.37.29ab\).89 Like the Vānaras and the Apsarases, Gandharvas are shape-shifters, and are explicitly identified as kāmarūpin- in both Sanskrit epics.90 Although, as we have seen above, Kulikov \(2021: 166–167\) has drawn attention to this significant aspect of the Gandharvas’ nature, many modern scholars 

have curiously ignored it.91 Kulikov cites two consecutive \(in the ŚS\) Atharvavedic stanzas \(ŚS 4.37.10–11abcd ~ PS 12.8.4, 6\) as evidence for the shape-shifting identity of the Gandharvas. One of these is the aforementioned verse \(ŚS 4.37.11abcd ~ 

PS 12.8.6cdef\) in which the singular Gandharva is said to assume forms like a 

dog, a monkey, and a youth with a full head of hair etc. Although Kulikov \(p. 167\) cites this verse in its Paippalāda rendering as “AVP 12.8.6”, he actually omits the opening two pādas of the Paippalāda stanza, which are peculiar to this version: 

śvetīkr̥ṇvānaḥ puruṣaṁ viśvā rūpāṇi bobhuvat “Turning man white, successively assuming all forms”.92 This is worth noting here because pāda b contains a clear 

echo of an indication that the shape-shifting nature of the \(singular\) Gandharva 

was acknowledged already in the Rigveda, at RV 9.85.12ab: ūrdhvó gandharvó ádhi nā́ke asthād víśvā rūpā́ praticákṣāṇo asya “The Gandharva has stood erect upon the vault, gazing upon all his forms” \(translation by Jamison and Brereton 2014: 1320\). 

**87** The Vānaras exhibit many of the typical characteristics of the Männerbund \(on which, see the following section §6.2\), though they are far greater in number than was the apparent norm for such groups \(on which, see e.g. Widengren 1969: 88–90, 99\). 

**88** On the shape-shifting abilities of Rāma’s loyal Vānara companion Hanumān, see Goldman and Sutherland Goldman \(1996: 43–47\). 

**89** Cf. Rām 4.32.6ab. These statements seem to refer back to Rām 1.16.1–6, where Brahmā asks ‘all the gods’ to father the Vānaras with Apsarases, Gandharva women and others. 

**90** See e.g. MBh 3.236.9d; Rām 4.41.17. 

**91** No mention is made of the Gandharvas’ shape-shifting character in such wide-ranging modern studies as for instance Oberlies \(2012\) and Norelius \(2015\). 

**92** PS 12.8.6ab. Text and translation by Hellwig, Leach and Zehnder \(2024\). 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[215]]

In arguing for the shape-shifting nature of the Gandharvas, Kulikov \(2021: 167\) 

also draws attention to the “metamorphic” character of the cognate Iranian aquatic monster called Gaṇdarəβa \(Middle Persian gandarw/ gandarb\), and to the survival of this word in modern Pamir languages, especially Shughni žindūrv \(< ✶ gandarba-\) 

‘werewolf’ and žindīrv, \(< ✶ gandarbī-\), ‘she-werewolf’ \(see also Panaino 2001\). The Indo-European figure of the werewolf is itself identified as a shape-shifter via e.g. 

Latin versipellis \(see Petronius Satyricon  62\) and Old Norse eigi einhamr ‘not of one shape \(or skin\)’, a description also applied to berserkir  warriors.93 As Burkert \(1983: 84–93\) has shown, like the Gandharvas and the Centaurs, werewolves were 

also linked to cannibalism and necrophagy, in mountainous Arcadia and else-

where.94 Numerous scholars since Weiser \(1927: 70–71\) have connected the figure 

of the werewolf to ancient initiation rites, to which cannibalism and necrophagy 

have been similarly linked \(Bremmer 2007: 73\). The hypothesized groups to which 

young, unmarried males are granted membership via such initiatory practices are 

commonly referred to in the scholarly literature, following Schurtz \(1902\), as Männerbünde.95 Members of such groups are attested cross-culturally to have engaged 

in warfare, hunting, cattle-raiding, and sexual license in wilderness areas away 

from the settled communities which raised them. The figure of the werewolf has 

itself been strongly linked to such groups,96 and several scholars since Dumézil 

\(1929\) have also identified the Centaurs as representing something akin to a Män-

nerbund.97 As we will see, Dumézil’s \(1929: 140–152\) view that the Gandharvas 

embody the same institution has also found support in subsequent scholarship,98 

and it is this view that brings Gandharvas closer to dogs. 

**93** See Guðmundsdóttir \(2007, 281–282\) and Korecká \(2019: 71–77\). 

**94** See also Buxton \(1987\) and Bremmer \(2007: 73\). Buxton \(1994: 83–84\) identifies the mountain \(ὄρος\) in ancient Greece as “an initiatory space” and as a place for hunting, among other pursuits. 

It is to be noted that Herodotus associates the Neuries, who reportedly become wolves for a few days each year, with their neighbours the Androphagoi \(‘Man Eaters’\); see Histories 4.105–106, 125. 

**95** Alternative names include “sodalities”, “warrior brotherhoods”, “Bruderschaften”, and “Jun-gmannschaften”. 

**96** The literature is extensive. Aside from Höfler \(1934\) and Wikander \(1938\), see Burkert \(1983: 83–184\), McCone \(1986\) and Kaliff and Oestigaard \(2022\) among more recent studies. 

**97** Thus McCone \(1987: 141\) refers to “die männerbundartigen Kentauren . . . ”, and Bremmer \(2021: XVIII\) remarks that the Centaurs suggest “a kind of men’s society” from “hoary antiquity”, while Marazov \(2011: 142\) claims that “the mythical centaurs are a reflection of the members of the male initiation alliances, the Maennerbund.” 

**98** The figures of the werewolf, the Centaur and the Gandharva have all been linked, in addition, to the practice of wearing animal skins and to animal masking \(on which, see e.g. Kershaw 2000: 40–55, 194–199\).

**6.2  The Gandharva, the Vrātya, and the Indo-European **

**Männerbund**

In an important essay, Vasilkov \(1989–1990: 394\) suggests that the tree-dwelling 

Gandharvas and Apsarases in the Atharvaveda’s wedding hymn \(ŚS 14.2 ~ PS 18.7–

18.14\) referred to above would have been impersonated during the marriage rite 

by other figures mentioned in the same sūkta, namely “the young people of the 

sabhā”, which is to say the “sisters or playmates of the bride” \( jāmí-, ŚS 14.2.61a\) and the “long-haired boy-dancers” \(see ŚS 14.2.59a: keśíno jánāḥ\). This fits with Vasilkov’s contention that “\[i\]n all probability the Apsarases and Gandharvas are nothing but the mythological ‘heavenly counterparts’ of the boys and girls of the Indo-Aryan ‘men’s house’” \(p. 392\).99 The boys who frequent this sabhā- ‘assembly hall’ or “men’s house” are identified by Vasilkov \(p. 397\) as being members of a 

Männerbund or “warrior brotherhood”. The girls, according to this reading, belong to all or many of the boys there \(see Vasilkov’s discussion of the terms bandhakī-and sādhāraṇī-\), and their presence is explained in terms of the sexual role they perform.100 As such, they are effectively regarded as prostitutes, and they appear to be the only females who are allowed to enter this otherwise exclusively male 

domain.101 These claims amount to a compelling argument,102 and as Vasilkov pro-

poses, this framework can help to explain why Apsarases and Gandharvas are, on 

the mythical plane, closely linked to music, dancing, sexual licentiousness and dicing \(and in the case of the Gandharvas, the consumption of intoxicating drinks\) – these are the activities which their human representatives, the young men and “promiscuous” women who frequent the sabhā, engage in there. It can also, I would argue, account for the Apsarases’ tendency to abandon their children103 \(and is perhaps 

**99** Vasilkov routinely refers to the ancient Indian institution called sabhā́- as the “men’s house”, which he characterises as “the residence of the age-group of the initiated unmarried boys” that 

“usually served as a centre of erotic life of the young people of the tribe, turning, as a rule, into a kind of ‘common dormitory’ for teenagers of both sexes” \(1989–1990: 389\). 

**100** Vasilkov \(1989–1990: 395\) argues that “the well-known idea that every girl before marriage belongs to the Gandharvas \(or a Gandharva\) now appears to be not a mythological fiction, but a reflection of social reality”. 

**101** On this see also Falk \(1986: 90–92\). Vasilkov’s and Falk’s ideas are usefully brought together and summarised by Norelius \(2015: 68–77\). 

**102** It has been accepted by several scholars including Oberlies \(1998: 229\), who adduces ŚBM 

13.4.3.7–8 as also identifying the beautiful young men \( yúvānaḥ śobhanā́ḥ\) and women \( yuvatáyaḥ 

śobhanā́ḥ\) who frequent the sabhā with the Gandharvas and Apsarases. 

**103** Examples include Urvaśī’s abandonment of her son Āyu \(suggested already at RV 10.95.13\) and the Apsaras Menakā’s abandonment of both Pramadvarā \(e.g. MBh 1.8.4–10\) and Śakuntalā \(MBh 1.66.8–9\).

linked to the Gandharvas’ involvement in infanticide\). Infant exposure or aban-

donment appears to have been fairly commonplace in ancient India \(as elsewhere\), 

especially among prostitutes.104

If the Apsarases are the celestial counterparts of the sexually promiscuous 

young women \(recall the Mahābhārata’s description of Apsarases as puṁścalī- as discussed in §4.1\) who frequent the “men’s house”, then the Gandharvas must be 

the celestial counterparts of the Vrātyas, the age-set group of initiated young men \(as well as older, marginalised persons, see Falk 1986: 51–55\)105 that several scolars have identified as embodying the institution of the Männerbund in South Asia.106 

These links between the Gandharvas and the Vrātyas have been noted before 

now.107 Falk \(1986: 66–72\) identifies a ‘seasonal rhythm’ \(“jahreszeitlichen Rhyth-mus”, p. 68\) to the Vrātyas’ life, which appears to have included a period frequenting the sabhā and engaging in sexually licentious behaviour at around the time of the winter solstice \(pp. 96–97\).108

There is a large body of scholarly literature on the Indo-European Männer-

bund \(PIE ✶ kóryos\) which does not need to be summarised here,109 though I will highlight three points germane to the themes I have been discussing. First of all, it has been well established \(already in the earliest scholarship, see e.g. Weiser 1927: 34–47, and Höfler 1934: 166–169 et passim\) that members of such Männerbünde **104** The classic study of this phenomenon in pre-modern Western Europe is Boswell \(1989\). On the practice of child exposure in ancient India, see Silk \(2007: especially pp. 303–305 on prostitutes abandoning their newborn children\). 

**105** In this respect, as in several others, the Vrātyas can be usefully compared to the Irish fíana; see especially Nagy \(1985: 20–21\), and McCone \(2012\). 

**106** On this view of the Vrātyas, see especially Heesterman \(1962\), Bollée \(1981\) and Falk \(1986\). 

Selva \(2019: 333–336\) provides an excellent overview. 

**107** Norelius \(2015: 78–81\) gives a good summary of the scholarship. See already Hillebrandt \(1927: 380\) and Hauer \(1927: 54\), and more recently Witzel \(1992: 618\): “The gandharvas seem to form, together with the promiscuous apsaras, the counterpart of the vrātya s and their female companions.” As Oberlies \(1998: 229 fn. 386\) points out, the compatibility of this idea with the concurrent scholarly consensus that the Maruts also form a celestial counterpart to the Vrātyas is a question that requires further investigation. 

**108** Held \(1935: 291–293\) and Bollée \(1981: 174\) had also connected the Vrātyas to the sabhā. 

**109** However, mention should be made of sceptical voices such as H. S. Versnel \(see Versnel 1990: 44–59\), Carlo Ginzburg \(see Ginzburg 1990: 153–181; Ginzburg and Lincoln 2020 \[first published 1989\]: 50–56\) and Bruce Lincoln \(Ginzburg and Lincoln 2020: 150–151\). Ginzburg’s and Lincoln’s unease with the Männerbund theory clearly fits the scholarly trajectory sketched by Harris \(1993: 78\): “As a concept for analysis for Old Germanic social groupings, the Männerbund fell into an unde-served disrepute as a result of reaction against the excesses of Otto Höfler’s famous book Kultische Geheimbünde der Germanen  and of the generally positive reception of its theories and its author by the National Socialists.”

were frequently symbolically linked to death, and specifically to the ancestral dead. 

It will be sufficient here to cite the prominent examples of Tacitus’ Harii \( Germania 

§43 feralis exercitus ‘army of ghosts’\), the \(etymologically related\) Norse einherjar \(the army of slain warriors in service to Óðinn in Valhǫll\) and their earthly counterparts the berserkir,110 and the Irish fían-members \( féinnidi\) who are described in different sources as  maic báis  and filiique mortis, both meaning ‘sons of death’ 

\(McCone 2012\). Secondly, less discussed by scholars, the young warriors of the Männerbund liked to steal women as much as cattle: one of the best-known examples 

here is no doubt the aforementioned rape of the Sabine women by Romulus and his 

followers. According to the account of Livy \( Ab urbe condita §1.9\) this took place, like the Centauromachy, amid celebrations and festivities, not of a wedding, but at the Consualia harvest festival. Vassilkov \(2019\) adduces further examples in the 

Armenian epic Sasna cṙer \( Daredevils of Sassoun\), and there are multiple tales of women being abducted by féinnidi in the Fenian Cycle \(see footnote 112 below\), and no shortage of cases of Männerbund-like bands of young men abducting women 

elsewhere.111 The Centaurs and Gandharvas provide further examples, as we have 

already seen. It is also worth noting here that the Gāndharva form of marriage recognised in the ritual and the legal literature, a marriage of mutual consent which does not involve the agreement of either partner’s family \(see e.g. ĀśvGS 1.6.5; VDh 24.23\), is routinely listed and considered alongside the Rākṣasa marriage \(marriage by forced abduction\), and indeed the two are described as being conducted con-jointly \(MDh 3.26; MBh 1.67.13\), a scenario which must entail \(as Medhātithi would later point out\) an abduction to which the woman consents.112

**110** On the relation between the einherjar  and the berserkir, see Schjødt \(2011\). 

**111** See for example Duby \(1977: 112–122\) on the “life of vagabondage” of the aristocratic youth \(the collective noun is juventus\) of northwestern France in the 12th century. Duby \(ibid.: 119\) writes: “\[T\]he ‘youth’ found himself caught up in a band of ‘friends’ who ‘loved each other like brothers’. This ‘company’ or ‘household’ \( maisnie\) . . . was sometimes formed, immediately after the ceremony of dubbing, by the young warriors who had received together the ‘sacrament of knight-hood’ on the same day, and who remained together thereafter” \(p. 114\). Consisting, in large part, of younger sons exluded from patrimony by primogeniture rights, these bands of youths, “animated by hopes of marriage” \(p. 119\), are described by Duby as “a mob of young men let loose, in search of profit, glory, and female prey” \(p. 122\). In the earlier, Carolingian period the picture was much the same: “The few ninth-century texts that survive are full of cases of abduction. Widows, nuns, wives, daughters, whether betrothed or not, all appear as so many quarries pursued by packs of young men . . . from all appearances rites of abduction were practiced quite literally by the Carolingian aristocracy” \(Duby 1983: 38–40\). 

**112** See Medhātithi’s Manubhāṣya  on MDh 3.26 \(p. 219\). As I intend to argue elsewhere, there are good reasons to believe that this so-called ‘combined’ \( miśra-\) Gāndharva and Rākṣasa marriage authorised by Manu, where the woman is willingly abducted by the man, was in fact the original form of the Gāndharva marriage. A cognate form of consensual abduction \(called lánamnas fox-

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[219]]

The third and final, and for our purposes the most important point is that 

the youthful members of roving war-bands regularly referred to themselves as 

‘dogs’ or ‘wolves’. This is well attested in primary sources in multiple languages \(Greek, Latin, Avestan, Old Irish, Old Norse etc.\) and has been well documented in the scholarly literature.113 In several Indo-European languages, the word for ‘dog’ 

also means ‘wolf’, and the two animals have frequently been used interchangeably 

in various Indo-European mythological traditions \(Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1995: 

505–506\).114 These warrior identifications as dogs and wolves, which often involved adopting ‘dog’ or ‘wolf’ as part of one’s personal name \(especially common in Germanic languages and in Old Irish\),115 have been explained by scholars as being 

linked primarily to a symbolic association with death, to a wolfish or ‘mad dog’ rage assumed in battle, to the wearing of wolfskins etc., and to the status of members of these groups as outlaws who, like dogs, live in packs apart from civilised society \(McCone 1987: 114; Bremmer 1982: 141\). 

In his wide-ranging study of the Vrātya in Vedic literature, Falk \(1986: 18–19\) 

identifies several passages which link the Vrātyas, the South Asian representatives of the Indo-European Männerbund \(Falk: “Bruderschaft”\), to dogs. Falk \(ibid.\) 

remarks that, compared to Iran or Europe, there is little information on the “Hun-dewesen der Bundesmitglieder” to be found in South Asian literary sources,116 and only a few passages which connect the terms ‘dog’ and ‘Vrātya’. However, he does 

make, or draw out, several further important connections between the two. The 

most explicit of these is his hypothesis that the leader of the Vrātyas \( gr̥hápati- or sthapáti-\) was chosen on the basis of the outcome of a dice game: it is the loser of this game \(i.e. the one left with the single nut, called káli-, which is understood as 

‘the dog’ and is identified with Rudra\), who is thenceforth the Vrātya-leader, himself ail\) is found in Old Irish legal literature \(see Kelly 1988: 70–71\), and Irish myth provides several accounts of the phenomenon; see e.g. the abduction of the wife of Ailill by Fothad Canainne \(discussed in Nagy 1997: 299–303\), and the abduction of Eargna by Conán \(MacNeill 1908: 95–98\). 

**113** Aside from Weiser \(1927\) and Höfler \(1934\), see especially Bremmer \(1982: 141\), McCone \(1987\), Ivančik \(1993\), Kershaw \(2000: 222–302\), and Speidel \(2004\). 

**114** See also e.g. McCone \(1987: 104–106\) and Ivančik \(1993: 312\). 

**115** Old Irish cú ‘dog, hound’ is a very common component of Old Irish personal names, Cú Chu-lainn being merely the best-known example \(see McCone 1987: 104–105\). 

**116** Here, it is worth quoting Vassilkov \(2015: 235\): “It is quite natural to suppose that the Aryas brought this kind of warrior societies \[ sic\] to South Asia from their northern homeland. However on the Indian soil the image of dog/wolf as a symbol of battle fury and an emblem of a warriors’ 

gang began from the earliest times to merge with the image of the more dangerous and widespread local predator: tiger/lion, and was practically replaced by it.” 

**220** 

Robert Leach

‘the dog’, clad \(like the Gandharvas\) in a black antelope skin,117 representative of the dead, and Rudra incarnate \(Falk 1986: 108–133\). Just as pertinent to my present concerns are Falk’s observations on the identity between the Vrātyas and the Sattrins, the performers of the ritual called sattrá-, a sacrificial ‘sitting’ or ‘session’ 

consisting of at least twelve days of Soma pressing, performed in the wilderness 

\( áraṇya-\) for the benefit of the performers themselves \(i.e. rather than on behalf of a yájamāna- ‘patron’\). Drawing and elaborating on the work of Biswas \(1955\) and Heesterman \(1962\), Falk \(1986: 37–40\) connects the Vrātyas, via the performance 

of the sattra, to rites involving cannibalism and necrophagy as detailed in e.g. the Taittirīya-Saṁhitā \(TS 7.2.10.2–5\) and the Kāṭhaka-Saṁhitā \(KS 34.11:44.14–18\). 

The ‘dog-like’ nature of such practices is not a topic explored by Falk, but the continuities are, at this point, plain to see, and it is no surprise, therefore, to see the Sattrins referred to elsewhere as dogs.118

If we return to the question of how dog-like the Gandharvas are, in sum, we can 

affirm, with Griffith \(1896: 86\), that a good case can be made for understanding the 

‘dogs’ that accompany the Apsarases to be Gandharvas. 

**7  Final Remarks**

In his revolutionary work on Homeric formulae, Milman Parry \(1987 \[first pub-

lished 1928\]\) argues that the use of epithets in Homer, and indeed in other forms of oral epic poetry, is determined by “the needs of versification”, in other words that one epithet is chosen over another of the same stock not on account of any semantic considerations, but because of its “metrical convenience”.119 Whether such claims are applicable to Vedic poetry is of course subject to debate, and indeed Parry’s main thesis has been treated cautiously by Gonda \(1959\) in his study of Rigvedic 

epithets.120 Nonetheless, Gonda \(1959: 254\) does somewhat reluctantly acknowl-

**117** Falk \(1986: 69\) notes that the Sattrins are similarly attired. Gandharvas are associated with the wearing of black antelope skins at e.g. Rām 3.18.12 and HV 44.9–10. 

**118** Falk \(1986: 40\) cites both the Chāgaleya-Upaniṣad \(2: śunaka-\) and the Chāndogya-Upaniṣad \(1.12: śvan-\). 

**119** On “the needs of versification”, see Parry \(1987: 9\), and on “metrical convenience” p. 136. Parry \(p. 118\) makes the assumption that “to ascertain the reasons for the use of a fixed epithet in a given case there is no need to consider what it denotes. In our study of the various devices which fixed epithets make possible, the facility of versification which they afford the poet appeared the only factor determining their use.” 

**120** Gonda \(1959: 253–254\) claims: “It is extremely difficult and in many cases impossible to state how far the exigencies of versification have been a factor of importance in the choice of epithets 

Some Remarks on Apsarases, Dogs and Gandharvas 

[[221]]

edge that Parry’s observations “seem to apply to the poets of the Veda as well”, 

admitting that metrical considerations can in fact determine the choice of epithets in the Rigveda \(p. 256\), and even that “the occurrence of an epithet . . . was, indeed, not infrequently largely dependent on the metre” \(p. 257\). “In many cases”, Gonda allows, “the right view of these metrically convenient elements seems to be to consider them as conditioned by sense and versification at the same time” \(p. 254\). In my view, Parry’s insights into oral poetic formulae are certainly worth bearing in mind when we consider the semantic motivations behind the term śvànvant- in the Atharvaveda. As we have seen, all six occurrences of this epithet are found in contexts in which the Apsarases are depicted as being threatening and harmful. 

The epithet śvànvant- we must adjudge suitable to this context, and not to any other, but beyond this, the specific concerns and narrative structures of each sūkta which contains the term should not necessarily guide or limit us in our attempts to understand its meaning. This is worth stating here because, for instance, the fact that the Gandharvas are named alongside the Apsarases in Ś2. and Ś3. should have no 

bearing, to my mind, on the plausibility of their also being referred to by way of śvànvant- in the same verse. 

As far as we are aware, the epithet śvànvant- was never employed by anyone other than the poets and reciters of the Atharvaveda Saṁhitās. We must presume 

that its use was limited to these works because it was not meaningful to the poets and ritualists of other Vedic traditions, and because it ceased to be meaningful 

even to those within the tradition of the Atharvaveda.121 Perhaps this was the case because attitudes towards the Apsarases themselves changed, and they ceased to be regarded as so threatening and harmful. We do not and cannot know how meaningful śvànvant- was even to those who composed the sūktas in which the term is found, we can only surmise that they knew that its meaning was appropriate to 

the contexts in which they employed it. It may be that the epithet was very old, 

even to them. Perhaps the very most we can say is that certain among the mean-

ings discussed above make better sense in these contexts than others and that the foregoing discussion suggests that death, understood in an abstract, general sense, and the Gandharvas seem to be the most likely designata of the term. There is little that is conclusive here, but at the least, given the Gandharvas’ intimate relation with death in Vedic literature, we can say that there is no need to view these as two wholly separate solutions to the puzzle. 

\[in the Rigveda\]”. For this reason, Gonda \(1959: 259\) goes on to argue that any theory which asserts the “dominant and fundamental character” of “the influence of metre and versification” on the use of Vedic epithets “should be judged with great caution and criticism.” 

**121** Hence its absence from later Atharvavedic works such as the Gopatha-Brāhmaṇa and the Kauśikasūtra.
