The kubjikA upaniShad, a text at the smArta-pashchimAmnAya interface, cites the below 5 R^ik-s by  pratIka:

> sahasrashIrShaM rudraM sahasrAkSham |
te pa~ncharchyaH | tasyAH shikhAyA madhye puruShaH kubjeshvaraH sthitaH ||

Here kubjeshvara is navAtman bhairava, the consort of  kubjikA

To date, I have not been able to locate these verses in any Vedic text, even though the majority of the kubjikA upaniShad citations are traceable to the two extant atharvaveda saMhitA-s, in line with its explicit affiliation with the atharvan tradition. 

One could note that the pratIka and concluding dala are close to comparable verses from the nArAyaNa-valli of the mahAnArAyaNopaniShad, recensions of which are appended to both the AV and the taittirIya shruti of KYV. Does it imply that there was once a rudrian variant of the nArAyaNa-valli in a lost AV tradition or was there such an imitation in the pashchimAmnAya. 

If so it would be a reverse case of mimicking of the pa~nchabrahma mantra-s in the vaiShNava tradition.+++(5)+++
