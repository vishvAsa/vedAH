**INTRODUCTORY NOTE**

 THIS Upaniṣad has derived its name from the six Praśnas or questions it contains. It belongs to the Atharvaveda and is probably of the Pippalādaśakhā. Śaṅkara calls it a Brāhmaṇa complementary to the Mantra Upaniṣad, i.e. the Muṇdaka, which also belongs to the same Veda. There are six chapters in the Upaniṣad, and each begins with a question. The first question refers to the origin of the created beings, the second to the constituents of the human personality, the third to the nature and origin of Prāṇa; the fourth is about the psychological aspect of the human personality, the fifth about Praṇava, and the sixth about the metaphysical principle in man. Like the Taittirīyopaniṣad, it also takes the reader gradually from the gross to the subtle principles of life, revealing one by one all the folds of Matter that enwrap the Ātman. Moreover, in this Upaniṣad alone we find a clear mention being made of the creation originating from Matter and Energy.

**NOTE ON TRANSLITERATION**

IN this book Devanāgarī characters are transliterated according to the scheme adopted by the International Congress of Orientalists at Athens in 1912 and since then generally acknowledged to be the only rational and satisfactory one. In it the inconsistencyirregularity and redundancy of English spelling are ruled out: f, q, w, x and z are not called to use; one fixed value is given to each letter. Hence a, e, i and g always represent **अ, ए, इ** and **ग्** respectively and never **ए, इ, ऐ**and **ज्** or other values which they have in English; t and d are always used for **त्** and **द्** only. One tialde, one accent, four macrons and ten dots (2 above, 8 below) are used to represent adequately and correctly all Sanskrit letters. The letter C alone represents **च्**. Since the natural function of h will be to make the aghoṣa ghoṣa (e.g. kh, ch, ṭh, th, ph, gh, jh, ḍh, dh, bh), it would be an anomaly for a scientific scheme to use it in combinations like ch and sh for giving **च्** and **ष्** values; hence ch here is **छ्** and sh **स्** **ह्**. The vowel **ॠ** is represented by ṛ because ri, legitimate for **रि**only, is out of place, and the singular ṛi is an altogether objectionable distortion. The tialde over n represents **ञ्**, ñ. Accent mark over s gives, **श**ś; dots above m and n give anusvāra (<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1734946641Screenshot2024-12-23150629.png"/>), ṁ and **ङ्** ṅ, respectively. Dots below h and r give visarga (:), ḥ, and **ॠ**, ṛ, respectively. Dots below s, n, t and d give their corresponding cerebrals **ष्, ण्, ट्** and **ङ्**, ṣ. ṇ, ṭand ḍ ; and macrons over a, i, u and ṛgive ā, ī, ū, ṝ respectively. Macrons are not used to lengthen the quantity of e and o, because they always have the long quantity in Sanskrit. Sanskrit words are capitalized only where special distinctiveness is called for, as in the opening of a sentence, title of books, etc. The scheme of transliteration in full is as follows:

  अ a आ ā, इ i, ई ī, उ u ऊ ū, ऋ ṛ, ऋ ṝ, ए e, ओ o, ऐai,
औau,<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1734946641Screenshot2024-12-23150629.png"/>ṁ,**:**ḥ,

**PEACE INVOCATION**

**ॐ भद्रं कर्णेभिः शृणुयाम देवाः भद्रं पश्येमाक्षभिर्यजत्राः।  
स्थिरैरङ्गैस्तुष्टुवाꣳ सस्तनूभिर् व्यशेम देवहितं यदायुः॥  
स्वस्ति न इन्द्रो वृद्धश्रवाः स्वस्ति नः पूषा विश्ववेदाः।

**ॐ शान्तिः। शान्तिः। शान्तिः॥**

**  देवाः** O gods (or worshipful Ones ) **कर्णेभिः** with the ears (of the teacher and the disciple) **भद्रम्**what is auspicious (i.e. words of the scripture etc.) **शृणुयाम** may we hear. **यजत्राः** efficient to sacrifice (**वयम्** we) **अक्षभिः** with eyes **भद्रम्**what is auspicious (sacrifice, worship, etc.) **पश्येम** may we behold. **स्थिरैः** perfect (lit. firm) **अङ्गैः** limbs and organs **तनूभिः** bodies (**युक्ताः वयम्** we having) **तुष्टुवांसः** singing (your praise) **देवहितम्** allotted by the Lord **आयुः** span of life **व्यशेम** may we obtain fully. **वृद्धश्रवाः** He who is glorified in the scriptures by ancient preceptors **इन्द्रः**the Supreme Lord **नः**for us **स्वस्ति**prosperity (in our study and in the practice

  Om. O worshipful Ones, may our ears hear what is auspicious. May we, efficient to worship, see with our eyes what is auspicious. May we, who sing your praise, live our allotted span of life in perfect health and strength.

 May Indra, the Lord who is extolled in the scriptures, Pūṣan the all-knowing, Tārkṣya who saves from all harm, and Bṛhaspati who protects our spiritual lustre, vouchsafe us prosperity in our study of the scriptures and the practice of the truths contained therein.

Om Peace : Peace : Peace.

\[NOTES— These two Peace Invocations are mantras that originally occur in the Ṛgveda Saṁhitā (1. lxxxix. 8. 6), and are used in connection with the Upaniṣads of the Atharvaveda\].

**PRAŚNOPANIṢAD**

**प्रथमः प्रश्नः FIRST QUESTION**

**  ॐ नमः परमात्मने। हरिः ॐ॥ सुकेशा च भारद्वाजः, शैब्यश्च सत्यकामः, सौर्यायणी च गार्ग्यः, कौसल्यश्चाश्वलायनो, भार्गवो वैदर्भिः कबन्धी कात्यायनस्ते हैते ब्रह्मपरा ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः परं ब्रह्मान्वेषमाणा, एव ह वै तत्सर्वं वक्ष्यतीति, ते ह समित्पाणयो भगवन्तं पिप्पलादमुपसन्नाः॥१॥**

**  भारद्वाजः** Son of Bharadvāja **सुकेशा** (called) Sukeśas **च** and, **शैब्यः** son of Sibi **सत्यकामः**(called) Satyakāma **च** and, **गार्ग्यः** of the clan of Garga **सौर्यायणी** the grandson of Sūrya **च** and, **आश्वलायनः** the son of Aśvala **कौसल्यः** (called) Kausalya **च** and, **वैदर्भिः** of Vidarbha **भार्गवः** Bhārgava (i.e. born of the clan of Bhṛgu), **कात्यायनः** the son of Katya (one whose great-grandfather is still living) **कबन्धी** (called) Kabandhin—**ते** they **ह**so the story goes **ब्रह्मपराः** devoted to Brahman **ब्रह्मनिष्ठाः** Stead fast in Brahman **परम्** the Supreme**ब्रह्म**Brahman **अन्वेषमाणाः** seeking (**आसन्** were) **ते**they **ह** indeed

**एषः** this person **ह वै** surely **तत्** that **सर्वम्** all **वक्ष्यति** will tell **इति** thus (**निश्चित्य** having thought) **समित्पाणयः** with sacrificial fuel in hand **भगवन्तम्**the venerable **पिप्पलादम्** Pippalāda **उपसन्नाः** approached.

 Om, adoration to the Supreme Self. The Supreme Lord who is ever attracting all towards Him is the Highest Reality.

 Sukeśas, the son of Bharadwāja; Satyakāma, the son of Sibi; the grandson of Sūrya of the clan of Garga; Kausalya, the son of Aśvala, Bhārgava of Vidarbha, Kabandhin, the son of Katya;— all**¹** these were devoted to Brahman and steadfast**²** in Brahman, and were in search of the supreme Brahman. With**³**sacrificial fuel in hand, they approached the venerable Pippalāda, thinking that he would tell them all that.

 \[NOTES— I*. All these were devoted to Brahman*— i.e., 'Brahman' here means the Saguṇabrahman of the Vedas.

* 2. Steadfast in Brahman*—i.e., well established in the practices of devotion to the Saguṇabrahman or Hiraṇyagarbha.

 3. *With sacrificial fuel in hand*— According to the customary rules, one should not visit the king, the deity in the temple, and the Guru without offering some kind of present. It was also customary with the pupils in

ancient times to get for their teachers the fuel for sacrifices.\]

  **तान् ह स ऋषिरुवाच— भूय एव तपसा ब्रह्मचर्येण श्रद्धया संवत्सरं संवत्स्यथ, यथाकामं प्रश्नान् पृच्छत, यदि विज्ञास्यामः सर्वंह वो वक्ष्याम इति॥२॥**

 **सः** that **ऋषिः** Ṛṣi (revealer of some Vedic mantra ) **तान्** to them **उवाच** said **ह** verily **तपसा** by penance, **ब्रह्मचर्येण** by abstinence, **श्रद्धया** by faith, **भूयः** again **एव** indeed **संवत्सरम्** a year **संवत्स्यथ** live. (**अनन्तरम्** after that) **यथाकामम्** according to the desire **प्रश्नान्** questions **पृच्छत** may ask; **यदि** if **विज्ञास्यामः** (we) know **वः** to you **ह** assuredly **सर्वम्** all **वक्ष्यामः** shall tell.

  The Ṛṣi said to them : 'Live again a year more in penance, abstinence, and faith; then you may ask questions according to your desire; if I know them, assuredly I shall tell everything to you.'

 \[NOTES—The Śruti here clearly indicates by the story that unless the pupil is thoroughly trained and disciplined through Tapas, abstinence, and faith, it is not possible to comprehend subtle spiritual truths. While Tapas and Brahmacarya are helpful in restraining the mind and the senses, Śraddhāis needed to make the pupil's mind receptive to the holy teachings impartedbythe Guru.\]

**  अथ कबन्धी कात्यायन उपेत्य पप्रच्छ, भगवन् कुतो ह वा इमाः प्रजाः प्रजायन्त इति॥३॥**

 **अथ** afterwards **कात्यायनः कबन्धी** Kabandhin, the young son of Katya, **उपेत्य**having approached (Pippalāda) **पप्रच्छ** asked : **भगवन्** Venerable Sir, **इमाः** these (visible) **प्रजाः** creatures **कुतः** whence **ह वै** as they say **प्रजायन्ते** are born?

 Then Kātyāyana Kabandhin having approached (Pippalāda) asked (him): 'Venerable Sir, whence are these creatures born?'

** तस्मै स होवाच— प्रजाकामो वै प्रजापतिः, स तपोऽतप्यत, स तपस्तप्त्वा स मिथुनमुत्पादयते रयिञ्चप्राणञ्चेति, एतौ मे बहुधा प्रजाः करिष्यत इति॥४॥**

 **सः** he (Pippalāda) **तस्मै** to him **उवाच** said : **सः** that **प्रजापतिः** Creator **प्रजाकामः** **(सन्)** being desirous of creatures **तपः** austerities (meditation) **अतप्यत** performed ; **सः** he **तपः** meditation **तप्त्वा** having performed **एतौ** these two **मे** my **प्रजाः** creatures **बहुधा** in manifold way **करिष्यतः** will do (produced) **इति**thus (**निश्चित्य**having determined) **सः** he **रयिम्** food (Matter) **प्राणम्** Prāṇa (Energy) **च** and **मिथुनम्** pair **उत्पादयते** created.

 To him Pippalāda replied : 'The Creator' desirous of progeny performed austerity in the

form of meditation. Having performed austerity, He created the pair— Matter**²** and Energy— thinking that they together would manifoldly bring forth creatures for Him.

 \[NOTES— 1. *Creator*—Hiraṇyagarbha.

 2. *Matter and Energy*— According to Śaṅkarācārya Rayi in the text means food, or the Moon; and Prāṇa means Fire, or the eater. Śaṅkara's interpretation is based upon the Vedic notion that all food is produced by the subtle influence of the Moon which is the cause of the liquid principle or Rasa on the earth; and the Sun which gives the earth its fire-principle or Tejas is the consumer of the former. This is physically as well as physiologically true for life is sustained and multiplied by food and respiration, Anna and Prāṇa. We have translated **रयि**as Matter and **प्राण**as Energy. Hiraṇyagarbha, the cosmic mind, first created out of himself Matter and Energy which produce all the varieties of the universe. This interpretation is in accord with the discoveries of modern Science, and quite convincing when read with the subsequent passages.\]

**  आदित्यो ह वै प्राणो, रयिरेव चन्द्रमा, रयिर्वा एतत् सर्वं यन्मूर्त्तं चामूर्त्तं च, तस्मान्मूर्त्तिरेव रयिः॥५॥**

 **आदित्यः** the Sun, **ह वै** verily **प्राणः** Energy; **चन्द्रमा** the Moon **एव** verily **रयिः** Matter **वा** or **यत्** what **मूर्त्तम्** withform (gross) **यत्** what **च** and **अमूर्त्तम्** formless (formless (subtle) **एतत्** these **सर्वम्** all **वै** verily **रयिः** Matter **तस्मात्** therefore **मूर्त्तिः**form **एव** indeed **रयिः**Matter.

 The**¹** Sun is Energy, and Matter**²** indeed is the Moon; or, Matter**³** verily are all these—what is with form and what is formless; therefore**⁴** form is Matter.

  \[NOTES— *1. The Sun is Energy.*—The Sun being the greatest centre of Energy, it has been conceived of as the main spring of life and activity, and is identified here with the Prāṇa, the cosmic Energy.

 2. *Matter indeed is the Moon.*— The Moon being devoid of all heat and light, is identified with inert matter; moreover, just as the Moon shines by the light of the Sun, so Matter too expresses itself through force or energy. Probably there is another reason for this identification. The word Rayi means food, and according to the Vedic mythology, the nectar of the Moon is the food of the gods, and on the earth all vegetables are produced through its influence; so the Moon is food or Rayi; but the crudeness of the simile has been cleared in the next sentence.

 3. *Matter verily are all these etc.*— Here the Śruti hints at the latest scientific view that whatever exists in this universe—objects with form or without form, gross or subtle, atomic or compound— is Matter, that Rayi and Prāṇa or Matter and Energy, are mutually convertible, and that the difference between the two is not radical but only conceptual— a difference only in the states of manifestation.

 4. *Therefore form is Matter.*—But according to the ordinary conception of matter, it is inert and gross and occupies space, i.e. it has form.\]

** अथादित्य उदयन् यत् प्राचीं दिशं प्रविशति तेन प्राच्यान् प्राणान् रश्मिषु सन्निधत्ते। यद्दक्षिणां यत्प्रतीचीं यदुदीचीं यदधो यदूर्ध्वं यदन्तरा दिशो यत्सर्वं प्रकाशयति तेन सर्वान् प्राणान् रश्मिषु सन्निधत्ते॥६॥**

**अथ** now **आदित्यः** the Sun **उदयन्** having risen **यत्** when **प्राचीम्** the eastern **दिशम्** quarter **प्रविशति** enters, **तेन** by that **प्राच्यान्** eastern **प्राणान्** Prāṇas **रश्मिषु** in the rays **सन्निधत्ते** holds ; **यत्** when **दक्षिणाम्** southern **यत्** when **प्रतीचीम्** western **यत्** when **उदीचीम्** northern **यत्** when **अधः** nadir, **यत्** when **ऊर्ध्वम्** zenith, **यत्** which **अन्तरा** intermediate **दिशः** quarters, **यत्** when (**अन्यत्** else ) **सर्वम्** all **प्रकाशयति** illumines **तेन** by that **सर्वान्** all **प्राणान्** Prāṇas **रश्मिषु** in the rays **सन्निधत्ते** holds.

  Now, when the Sun after having risen enters the East, then he holds Prāṇas of the East in his rays. When he illumines the South, the West, the North, the Zenith, the Nadir, the Intermediate quarters, and all, by his rays he holds all the Prāṇas.

  \[NOTES— The Śruti here states that wherever there is the manifestation of life and energy, they are due to the quickening influence of the Sun.\]

**   स एषवैश्वानरो विश्वरूपः प्राणोऽग्निरुदयते। तदेतदृचाभ्युक्तम्॥७॥**

** सः** He **एषः** this **प्राणः**Prāṇa **विश्वरूपः** of universal form **वैश्वानरः** of universal life **अग्निः**Fire **उदयते** rises. **तत्** that **एतत्** this **ऋचा** by the Ṛk **अभ्युक्तम्** described.

  Thus**¹** rises He the Prāṇa, of universal life and universal form, the Fire. It has been described by the following Ṛk**²**.  
 \[NOTES— *1. Thus rises he etc*— The Sruti asserts that the Sun and Fire are both manifestations of the same Prāṇa (Energy) which is universal and all-per-vading.

  2. *Ṛk.*— A laudatory verse a collection of which constitutes the Ṛgveda.\]

 **विश्वरूपं हरिणं जातवेदसं परायणं ज्योतिरेकं तपन्तम्। सहस्ररश्मिः शतधा वर्तमानः शतधा वर्तमानः प्राणः प्रजानामुदयत्येष सूर्यः॥८॥**

  **विश्वरूपम्** of universal form **हरिणम्** full of rays **जातवेदसम्** omniscient **परायणम्** the basis of all (life) **एकम्** one **ज्योतिः** effulgent **तपन्तम्** he who gives heat (**तम् सूर्यम्** the sun **सुधियः विज्ञातवन्तः** the seer know). **सहस्ररश्मिः** of thousand rays **शतधा** in hundred ways **वर्त्तमानः** existing **प्रजानाम्** of the creatures **प्राणः** life **एषः** this **सूर्यः** the sun **उदयति** rises.

(The wise know him, who is) of universal form, full of rays, omniscient, the basis of all

(life), the effulgent one, and (great) giver of heat. There rises the Sun of thousand rays who is manifold in existence and the life of all creatures.

\[NOTES— The spiritualization of Prāṇa identified with the Sun is most significant in the Vedāntic Metaphysics.\]

** संवत्सरो वै प्रजापतिः, तस्यायने दक्षिणञ्चोत्तरं च। तद्ये ह वै तदिष्टापूर्त्तेकृतमित्युपासते, ते चान्द्रमसमेवलोकमभिजयन्ते, त एव पुनरावर्त्तन्ते। तस्मादेवऋषयः प्रजाकामा दक्षिणं प्रतिपद्यन्ते। एष ह वै रयिर्यः पितृयाणः॥९॥**

**  प्रजापतिः** Prajāpati (Lord of the creatures) **वै**verily**संवत्सरः** the whole year ; **तस्य** his **दक्षिणम् च** the south **उत्तरम् च** and the north **अयने** two paths (**वर्तेत** exist) ; **तत्** therefore **ये** who **ह वै** verily (or, as it is well-known) **तत्** that **इष्टापूर्त्ते**(**इष्टम् च पूर्त्तम् च**) the performance of Vedic sacrifices and doing such philanthropic works as digging a well or a tank for the public, or establishing an almshouse etc., **कृतम्** work worth doing, or of permanent value, **इति** thus **उपास्ते** do devoutly **ते** they **चान्द्रमसम्** the lunar **लोकम्** world **अभिजयन्ते** conquer (attain) ; **ते** they **एव** verily **पुनरावर्त्तन्ते** return again. **तस्मात्** therefore **एते** these **ऋषयः** the Ṛṣis **प्रजाकामाः** desirous of progeny, **दक्षिणम्** the southern **प्रतिपद्यन्ते** go ; **एषः** this **ह वै** indeed **रयिः** Matter **यः** which **पितृयाणः** the path of the manes.

  The**¹**year is verily Prajāpati, and his**²** paths are two, the southern and the northern ; now, those who perform the ***Iṣṭāpūrta***^(**3**) (Vedic sacrifice and charitable work) thinking them as works of supreme value, they attain the world of the Moon and afterwards return here again. Therefore those Ṛṣis who desire offspring go by the Southern Path. Matter⁴verily is this path of the manes.

  \[NOTES— *1. The year is verily Prajāpati.*— Here 'year' means Time. Time indeed is Prajāpati, the Lord of creation, because everything is within the control of time. Moreover, psychologically the conception of time forms the basis of that of creation; for creation is the phenomenon of causation (i.e., a reading of Reality as cause and effect). We cannot conceive of a cause changing into an effect without the necessary conception of moments which alone gives us the idea of antecedence and sequence. Śri Kṛiṣṇa also says in the Gītā 'Of measurers I am Time.'

 2. *His paths etc*.—As the year has two parts according to the two solstices, so two paths are laid out by the Prajāpati (Time) for the departed souls in accordance with the Law of Causation, or Karma and its due effect. Vide Notes on Gītā VIII. 24, 25 (Advaita Ashrama Edition)

3. ***Iṣṭāpūrta*-**

**अग्निहोत्रं तपः सत्यं भूतानां चानुपालनम्।  
आतिथ्यं वैश्वदेवश्च इष्टमित्यभिधीयते॥**

  'The daily sacrifice of ***Agnihotra***, austerity, truthfulness, maintenance of animals, feeding of the guests and feeding the birds and beasts—these are called ***Iṣṭa.***'

**वापीकूपतडागादि देवतायतनानि च।  
अन्नप्रदानमारामः पूर्त्तमित्यभिधीयते॥**

  'Sinking wells or excavation of tanks for the public, building temples, giving food to the hungry, laying out public gardens—these are called ***Pūrta***.'

  4. *Matter verily is this path of the manes*.-Since those alone who are attached to the material life go to the Candraloka by this path of the manes' and return again and again into this world, it is called matter in contradistinction to the other path spoken of in the next section, which leads to the spiritual illumination and non-birth. This Pitṛyāna is the material conception of Life—a gross dream, as it were, of the soul, hence it is matter.\]

**अथोत्तरेण तपसा ब्रह्मचर्येण श्रद्धया विद्ययात्मानमन्विष्यादित्यमभिजयन्ते। एतद्वै प्राणानामायतनमेतदमृतमभयमेतत् परायणमेतस्मान्न पुनरावर्त्तन्त इत्येष निरोधः। तदेष श्लोकः॥१०॥**

** अथ** again **तपसा** by austerity **ब्रह्मचर्येण** by self-discipline, **श्रद्धया** by faith, **विद्यया** by knowledge, **आत्मानम्** the Ātman, Self **अन्विष्य** having sought **उत्तरेण** by the Northern Path **आदित्यम्** the Sun **अभिजयन्ते** attain **एतत्** this (Sun) **वै** verily **प्राणानाम्** of all the Prāṇas or Energy **आयतनम्** abode (source) ; **एतत्** this **अमृतम्** immortal and

imperishable, **अभयम्** free from fear, **एतत्** this **परायणम्** Supreme resort ; **एतस्मात्** from this (Sun) **पुनः** again **न आवर्त्तन्ते** do not return. **इति** thus **एषः** this (the Northern Path) **निरोधः**(is) the end (lit. restriction). **तत्**on the same **एषः** this **श्लोकः** verse (**भवति** there is).

 But those who have sought the Ātman by austerity, abstinence, faith and knowledge, attain**¹**the Āditya by the Northern Path. This ^(**2**)is the source of all Energy, this is immortal and free from fear, this is the supreme resort. From there they do not return, for it**³** is the end. There is the following verse on it:  
 \[NOTES— *1.* *Attain the Āditya*—According to other Upaniṣads and the Brahmasūtras, such a soul goes along the Devayāna (Path of gods) to the world of the Āditya; and from there goes on to the Brahmaloka, the world of Brahmā, and at the end of the cycle of time merges into Brahman along with Brahmā. This is known as the path of Kramamukti (gradual liberation).

  2. *This is immortal etc.*—Because the follower of this path is no more subjected to transmigration.

  3. *It is the end*— Śaṅkarācārya explains**निरोधः**of the text as 'blocked,' i.e. this Northern Path is blocked for the ignorant and persons devoid of the necessary qualities.\]

** पञ्चपादं पितरं द्वादशाकृतिं दिव आहुः परे अर्धे पुरीषिणम्। अथेमे अन्य उ परे विचक्षणं सप्तचक्रे षडर आहुरर्पितमिति॥११॥**

**पञ्चपादम्** with five feet **द्वादशाकृतिम्** with twelve forms **पितरम्** father **दिवः**of the sky **परे** above **अर्धे** half **पुरीषिणम्** excreting (giving rains) **आहुः**(the sages) say. **अथ** again **परे अन्ये** others **इमे** these (the sages) **विचक्षणम्** the seer (the sun) **सप्तचक्रे**of seven wheels **षडरे**on six-spoked (chariot) **अर्पितम्** placed (**इति** thus) **आहुः** say.

 Some sages say that he**¹** is the father with**²** five feet and twelve^(**3**) forms, giving rains fromthe upper half of heaven; others again say**⁴** that the seer is placed on a chariot of seven**⁵** wheels and six**⁶** spokes.

\[NOTES— 1. *He is the father.*—The sun is called the father of all because all life proceeds from him and is sustained by him. The sun is identified with the year or Time as he is the maker or measurer of Time.

2. *With five feet*—i.e., with the five seasons, counting Hemanta and Śiśira as one.

3.*Twelve forms*—i.e., the twelve months.

4. *The seer*—i.e., the sun who sees and knows all, since he is immanent in all in the form of energy.

5. *Seven wheels*—i.e., the seven rays of colours known as the seven horses of the Sun.

6. *Six spokes*—the six (Indian) seasons.

 The drift of the text is that it is the Sun, the Prāṇa, who makes the time, who marks it out into the year which has several sub-divisions and phases, andwho thus functions as the coutroller and father of all. This verse and occurs originally in the Ṛgveda-1. 164. 12\]

 **मासो वै प्रजापतिस्तस्य कृष्णपक्ष एव रयिः शुक्लः प्राणस्तस्मादेव ऋषयः शुक्ल इष्टं कुर्वन्तीतर इतरस्मिन्॥१२॥**  
** मासः** the month **वै** verily **प्रजापतिः** Prajāpati (lord of creatures) **तस्य** its **कृष्णपक्षः** the dark fortnight **एव** only **रयिः** matter **शुक्लः** the bright (fortnight) **प्राणः** Prāṇa. **तस्मात्** therefore **एते** these **ऋषयः** the Ṛṣis **शुक्ले** in the bright (fortnight) **इष्टम्** sacrifices **कुर्वन्ति** perform ; **इतरे** others **इतरस्मिन्** in the other (i.c. in the dark fortnight).

  The month is verily Prajāpati. Its dark fortnight is Matter, and its bright fortnight Prāṇa. Therefore some Ṛṣis perform their sacrifices in the bright fortnight; others in the other half.

\[NOTES—*The same play of light and darkness*—of Matter and Energy—of activity and inactivity—which is manifest in infinite Time, in the form of creation and dissolution, is noticeable also in the period of a year in two solstices and also in a month in the form of two fortnights, and in a day in the form of day and night.\]

** अहोरात्रो वै प्रजापतिस्तस्याहरेव प्राणो रात्रिरेव रयिः। प्राणं वा एते प्रस्कन्दन्ति ये दिवा रत्या संयुज्यन्ते, ब्रह्मचर्यमेव तद्यद्रात्रौ रत्या संयुज्यन्ते॥१३॥**

 **अहोरात्रः** Day and Night **वै** surely **प्रजापतिः** Prajāpati. **तस्य** its **अहः** day **एव** indeed **प्राणः** Prāṇa (Energy)

**रात्रिः** night **एव** verily **रयिः** matter. **ये** who **दिवा** by day **रत्या** in sexual intercourse **संयुज्यन्ते** combine **प्राणम्** Prāṇa **वै** assuredly **एते** they **प्रस्कन्दन्ति** dissipate. **रात्रौ** in night **यत्** when **रत्या** in sexual intercourse **संयुज्यन्ते** are united **तत्** that **ब्रह्मचर्यम्** control **एव** indeed.

  Day and night are Prajāpati; of Prajāpati day is Prāṇa (Energy) and night is matter.So those who unite in sexual love by day, dissipate their Prāṇa; but**¹**control, indeed, is that when they unite by night.

\[NOTES— *1. But control indeed etc*.— We have translated the word Brahmacarya in the text as 'control' for it apparently means here 'discipline,' or self-control in sexual indulgence, and not complete continence which the word usually means.\]

**  अन्नं वै प्रजापतिस्ततो ह वै तद्रेतस्तस्मादिमाः प्रजाः प्रजायन्त इति॥१४॥**

**  अन्नम्** food **वै** verily **प्रजापतिः** Prajāpati; **ततः**from that **तत्** that **रेतः** the seed (semen) (**जायते** is produced) ; **तस्मात्** from that **इमाः** these **प्रजाः** creatures **प्रजायन्ते** are born.

  Food is verily the Prajāpati. From that is produced the seed, and from that again all these creatures are born.

\[NOTES— This Section directly gives the answer to the first question; but hitherto the Śruti has been dealing only with the fundamental principles of creation. The question was 'Whence are these creatures born?'; and in answer to it, the teacher first said (Sec. 4) that Matter and Energy are the two fundamental principles of creation. Next (Sec. 5 to 8) the various expressions and functions in general, of Energy and Matter, in maintaining the creation are described. Then (Sections 9 and 10) he spoke of the two paths, the material and the spiritual, by which a soul can travel after death, according to his Karma and Knowledge. Next (Sections 11 to 13) he digressed in giving the descriptions of minor sub-divisions of time, such as seasons, months, and days, and pointed out that all these divisions, like Time itself, are but the working of the same Matter and Energy, and through them they control the life. And then in the present Section he gives the direct reply that 'from the seed the creatures are born.'

  It may appear strange why the teacher should apparently depart so much from the point before directly giving the answer which after all was a statement of a simple biogenetic fact perhaps well-known to the questioner himself. But there is a deeper significance in it. In making so many preliminary statements with regard to Prāṇa and Rayī (Energy and Matter) before mem- tioning the Biological origin of life, the teacher had two things in view. First, by stating the fact that Matter and Energy are the principal sources of the Creation, the teacher pointed out that the bioplasmic origin of life is but a secondary expression of the same Matter and Energy. Secondly, by mentioning the

eschatology even before his answer to the question on the origin of life, he hinted that there could be no first origin of life, nor of any creature for the matter of that, in the true sense of the term. Life is beginningless and so are the creatures. The life-principle, the soul, has to undergo bodily expressions from time to time, from Cycle to Cycle,— that is all,—but has no real origin.

 In the Sections 9, 12, 13 and 14 the word Prajāpati is used with a peculiar significance. Primarily the word means Brahmā or Hiraṇyagarbha whose another expression is Time (as explained in the notes on the 9th Section) and then it is used rather loosely for the minor divisions of Time such as year, month, and day, as they consist of the dual expressions of Matter and Energy. In the 14th Section, the sperm is called Prajāpati since it is the source of the individual physical life as Hiraṇyagarbha is that of the collective.\]

**  तद्ये ह वै तत्प्रजापतिव्रतं चरन्ति ते मिथुनमुत्पादयन्ते। तेषामेवैष ब्रह्मलोको येषां तपो ब्रह्मचर्यं येषु सत्यं प्रतिष्ठितम्॥२५॥**

 **तत्** thus **ये** those **तत्** that **प्रजापतिव्रतम्** rule of Prajāpati **चरन्ति** observe **ते** they **मिथुनम्** a pair **उत्पादयन्ते** produce. **येषाम्** of those **तपः** penance **ब्रह्मचर्यम्** abstinence, **येषु** in whom **सत्यम्** truth **प्रतिष्ठितम्** established, **तेषाम्** their **एव** verily **एषः** this **ब्रह्मलोकः** the heaven of Brahmā.

  Therefore, those who observe the**¹** rule of. Prajapati produce**²** a pair. For them verily

is the Brahmaloka**³**, who have penance and abstinence**⁴** and in whom truth abides.

 \[NOTES— *1. The rule of Prajāpat*i—i.e. Ṛtukālagamanam, and what is spoken of in section 13.

* 2. Produce a pair*—i.e., son and daughter.

 3. *The Brahmaloka*—Here only the Candraloka is meant and not the supreme heaven of Brahmā.

 4. *Abstinence*—i.e., Brahmacarya mentioned in section 13.

 This section tells us that those ignorant householders who simply observe the rule of Prajāpati,' get the fruit in this world in the shape of sons and daughters,' but those who have in addition, penance discipline,' and truthfulness and have performed Iṣtāpūrta, go to the 'Heaven of Moon' hereafter.\]

**  तेषामसौ विरजो ब्रह्मलोको न येषु जिह्ममनृतं न माया चेति॥१६॥**

**  येषु** in whom **जिह्मम्** deceit, **अनृतम्** falsehood, **न** not, **माया** guile **च** and **न** not, **तेषाम्** their **असौ** that **विरजः** pure **ब्रह्मलोकः**the world of Brahmā. thus (the section ends).

 That pure**¹** world of Brahmā belongs to them only in whom rests not deceit, falsehood, or guile.

  \[NOTES—*1. Pure world of Brahmā*—i.e., the supreme heaven spoken of in section 10.\]

**END OF THE FIRST QUESTION**

**द्वितीयः प्रश्नः SECOND QUESTION**

** अथ हैनं भार्गवो वैदर्भिः पप्रच्छ। भगवन् कत्येव देवाः प्रजां विधारयन्ते? कतर एतत्प्रकाशयन्ते? कः पुनरेषां वरिष्ठ? इति॥१॥**

 **अथ** then **वैदर्भिः** **भार्गवः** the Bhārgava of Vidarbha **एनम्** him **पप्रच्छ** asked, **भगवन्** Holy Sir, **कति** how many **एव** verily **देवाः** gods **प्रजाम्** creatures **विधारयन्ते** support? maintain. **कतरे** how many **एतत्** this **प्रकाशयन्ते** manifest? **कः** who **पुनः** again **एषाम्** of these **वरिष्ठः** the greatest ?

 Next, the Bhārgava of Vidarbha asked him: 'Holy Sir, how many are the Gods**¹** who support the creatures? How many (of them) manifest**²** it? And who again is the greatest of them?'

 \[NOTES—1. The gods—i.e., powers, organs, or the senses.

 2. Manifest it—i.e., express their power.\]

** तस्मै स होवाचाकाशो ह वा एष देवो वायुरग्निरापः पृथिवी वाङ्मनश्चक्षुः श्रोत्रं च। ते प्रकाश्याभिवदन्ति वयमेतद्वाणमवष्टभ्य विधारयामः॥**

**  स** he (Pippalāda) **तस्मै** to him **उवाच** said, **एषः** that **देवः** god **आकाशः** the sky, **वायुः** air, **अग्निः**fire, **आपः** water, **पृथिवी** earth, **वाक्** speech (organ of speech), **मनः** mind, **चक्षुः** eye, **श्रोत्रम्** ear **च** and **ते** they **प्रकाश्य** having manifested (their power) **अभिवदन्ति** vaunt **वयम्** we **एतत्** this **बाणम्** body (lit perishable) **अवष्टभ्य** having held together **विधारयामः** support.

  To him he replied : 'The ether is that God, the air, fire, water, earth, speech, mind, eye and ear. These having manifested their power, vaunt and say, “We (each of us), holding this body, support it."

** तान् वरिष्ठः प्राण उवाच। मा मोहमापद्यथ अहमेवैतत्पञ्चधात्मानं प्रविभज्यैतद्बाणमवष्टभ्य विधारयामीति ; तेऽश्रद्दधाना बभूवुः॥३॥**

 **वरिष्ठः** the supreme (chief) **प्राणः** Prāṇa (vital energy) **तान्** to them **उवाच** said **मोहम्** self-delusion **मा** do not **आपद्यथ** fall into**अहम् I** **एव** verily **एतत्** this **आत्मानम्** myself **पञ्चधा** in five parts **प्रविभज्य** having divided **एतत्** this **बाणम्** body **अवष्टभ्य** holding **विधारयामि** support. **ते** they (the other gods) **अश्रद्दधानाः** unbelieving **बभूवुः** became.

 The chief Prāṇa then declared: 'Do not be deluded. **I¹** alone, dividing myself into five

parts, hold this body and support it.' But they were not disposed to believe his words.

 \[NOTES—*1. I alone dividing myself etc.*—Here it refers to the five kinds of vitai breath, viz., Prāṇa, Apāna, Samāna, Udāna, and Vyāna which are supposed to function in maintaining the body. But the powers which the sensory and motor organs manifest by their functioning are only expressions of the one vital energy that pervades the whole body, and which again is a part of the universal energy. There is only one Prāṇa that acts through the body and Nature. This truth has been allegorically described here as well as in the subsequent sections.\]

**सोऽभिमानादूर्ध्वमुत्क्रमत इव; तस्मिन्नुत्क्रामत्यथेतरे सर्व एवोत्क्रामन्ते तस्मिꣳश्चप्रतिष्ठमाने सर्व एव प्रातिष्ठन्ते। तद्यथा मक्षिका मधुकरराजानमुत्क्रामन्तं सर्वा एवोत्क्रामन्ते, तस्मिꣳश्च प्रतिष्ठमाने सर्वा एव प्रातिष्टन्त, एवं वाङ्मनश्चक्षुःश्रोत्रं च ते प्रीताः प्राणं स्तुन्वन्ति॥४॥**

 **सः** he (Prāṇa) **अभिमानात्** from indignation **ऊर्ध्वम्** upward **उत्क्रमते** was going out **इव** as if ; **तस्मिन्** when he i.e. the chief Prāṇa) **उत्क्रामति** when gone out, **अथ** thereupon **इतरे** others **सर्वे एव** all **प्राणाः** Prāṇas (senses and organs) **उत्क्रामन्ते** get out; **तस्मिन्** when he (te the chief Prāṇa) **च** and **प्रतिष्ठमाने** when being established **सर्वे** all **एव** verily **प्रातिष्ठन्ते** are established, **तत् यथा**as**मधुकरराजानम्** the king of the bees (queen-bee) **उत्क्रामन्तम्** in

going out **सर्वाः**all **एव** verily **मक्षिकाः** bees **उत्क्रामन्ते** go out **तस्मिन्** when he (the King) **प्रतिष्ठमाने** being established **सर्वाः** एव all **प्रतिष्ठन्ते** are established ; **एवम्** thus **वाक्** speech **मनः** mind **चक्षुः**eyes **श्रोत्रम्** ears **च** and (**अकुर्वन्** did). **ते** they **प्रीताः** being pleased **प्राणम्** the Prāṇa **स्तुन्वन्ति** praises.

  He from indignation appeared to go out upwards (from the body); thereupon as he was about to go out, all others seemed to go out and when he was being established, all others were also established. Just as bees go out when their queen goes out, and settle down when she settles down, so did the speech, mind, eye, ears, (etc.). Being satisfied they praised the Prāṇa.

 \[NOTES—It should be noted here that mind also is included among the dependants of Prāṇa; i.e., even the mental activities are but the expressions of the same energy that functions through the body and the senses.\]

**एषोऽग्निस्तपत्येष सूर्य एष पर्जन्योघमवानेष वायुः।  
एष पृथिवी रयिर्देवः सदसच्चामृतं च यत्॥५॥**

 **एषः** this (Prāṇa) **अग्निः** fire (**सन्** being) **तपति** burns **एषः** this **सूर्यः** sun; **एषः** this **पर्जन्यः** cloud (**एषः** this) **मघवान्** Indra **एषः** this **वायुः** wind **एषः** this **देवः** bright

one **पृथिवी** the earth, **रयिः** (matter) **सत्** what is **असत्** what is not **च** and **अमृतम्** immortal**च** and **यत्**what.

  He**¹**burns as fire; He is the sun; He is the cloud; He is Indra; He is the wind. Thisbright one is (verily) earth, matter, what**²** is and what**³** is not and also what**⁴**is immortal.

 \[NOTES— *1. He burns as fire etc*.— Śri Śaṅkarācārya explains the first half of this passage as follows:He burns as fire, shines as the sun, rains as the cloud,and rules the subjects and kills the demons as Indra.

 2. *What is* — i.e., the gross, visible objects.

 3. *What is not*— i.e., subtle, imperceptible casualmatter. It is called asat because it is non-existent tothe senses.

 4. *What is immortal*— i.e,, which is the basis of therelative immortality of gods.

 Here Prāṇa is spoken of as the ruling force ofNature, nay, as Nature herself.\]

**अरा इव रथनाभौ प्राणे सर्वं प्रतिष्ठितम्।  
ऋचो यजूꣳषि सामानि यज्ञः क्षत्रं ब्रह्म च॥६॥**

** रथनाभौ** in the nave of a wheel **अराः** spokes **इव** as**प्राणे** in Prāṇa **सर्वम्** all **प्रतिष्ठितम्** are established. **ऋचः**the Ṛks (Veda) **यजूꣳषि** Yajus (Veda) **सामानि** Sāmas(Veda) **यज्ञः** Sacrifice **क्षत्रम्** Kṣatriyas **ब्रह्म** Brāhmaṇas **च**and (**तस्मिन्** **प्रतिष्ठितम्** are established in that),

  As spokes in the nave of the wheel, all**¹**are fixed in Prāṇa-Ṛks, Yajus, Sāmas, sacrifice, Kṣatriyas and Brāhmaṇas.

 \[NOTES— *1. All are fixed in Prāṇa etc*.— Here the Vedas are mentioned as fixed in Prāṇa inasmuch as their recitation depends upon Prāṇa, or, it may mean that they have their original manifestation in Hiraṇyagarbha, the universal mind or Prāṇa. Prāṇa is identified with the universal life-force.\]

** प्रजापतिश्चरसि गर्भे त्वमेव प्रतिजायसे। तुभ्यं प्राण प्रजास्त्विमा बलिं हरन्ति यः प्राणैः प्रतितिष्ठसि॥७॥**

**  त्वम्** thou **एव** verily **प्रजापतिः**lord of creatures (**सन्** being) **गर्भे** in the womb **चरसि** dwellest, **प्रतिजायसे** art re-born. **प्राण** O Prāṇa **इमाः** these **प्रजाः** creatures **तु**again **तुभ्यम्** to thee **बलिम्** offerings **हरन्ति** bring, **यः** that **त्वम्** thou **प्राणैः** with the Prāṇas (i.e., senses ) **प्रतितिष्ठसि**dwellest.

  Verily as Prajāpati thou wanderest in the womb and art born again. To**¹** thee, O Prāṇa, who dwellest in the body with the senses these creatures carry their offerings.

\[NOTES—Prāṇa is Prajāpati, the universal Life; as a finite principle of life he enters into the womb and is re-born in the form of a child,-this is the play of Life, of Prāṇa.

1. *To Thee these creatures carry etc.*—The senses gather the perceptions of their respective objects not for any selfish gain, but for fostering the Life, the Prāṇa in the body.\]

**देवानामसि वह्नितमः पितॄणां प्रथमा स्वधा।  
ऋषीणां चरितं सत्यमथर्वाङ्गिरसामसि॥८॥**

  (**त्वम्** thou) **देवानाम्** for gods **वह्नितमः** the best carrier, **पितॄणाम्** for the manes **प्रथमा** first **स्वधा** offering (lit. that which gives satisfaction) **अथर्वाङ्गिरसाम्**Atharvāṅgiras **ॠषीणाम्** of the Ṛṣis **सत्यम्** true **चरितम्** effort, work, **असि** (thou) art.

  Thou art the**¹**best carrier for gods and the first offering to the manes. Thou art the true effort of Atharvāṅgiras**²** Ṛṣis.

 \[NOTES— *1. The best carrier for gods*— It is believed that the god of fire, Agni, carries to other gods the oblation offered into the fire, and so he has got the name Vahni (carrier). Agni is but another expression of Prāṇa which is immanent in all, even in the gods. So who can be a better carrier of offerings than Prāṇa?  
  2. Atharvāṅgiras Ṛṣis.— Śaṅkarācārya takes it as the senses.\]

**इन्द्रस्त्वं प्राण तेजसा रुद्रोऽसि परिरक्षिता।  
त्वमन्तरिक्षे चरसि सूर्यस्त्वं ज्योतिषां पतिः॥९॥**

**  प्राण** O Prāṇa, **त्वम्** thou **इन्द्रः** Indra **तेजसा** by prowess **रुद्रः** Rudra **असि** art; **परिरक्षिता** the protector **त्वम्** thou **सूर्यः** the sun **अन्तरिक्षे** in the sky **चरसि** movest **त्वम्** thou **ज्योतिषाम्** of lights **पतिः** lord.

  O Prāṇa, Thou art Indra,**¹** and Rudra**²** by prowess, and (also art Thou) the Protector.**³** Thou movest in the sky as the sun. Thou**⁴** art the lord of lights.

  \[NOTES— *1. Indra*—Here it may mean Brahmāthe Creator.

  2. *Rudra*—The Destroyer.

  3. *The Protector*—i.e., Viṣṇu.

  4. *Thou art the lord of lights*—i.e., all lights shine due to thee.\]

**यदा त्वमभिवर्षस्यथेमाः प्राण ते प्रजाः।  
आनन्दरूपास्तिष्ठन्ति कामायान्नं भविष्यतीति॥१०॥**

  **प्राण** O Prāṇa **त्वम्** thou **यदा** when **अभिवर्षसि** rainest **अथ** then **ते** thy **इमाः** these **प्रजाः** creatures **कामाय** to the satisfaction of their desire **अन्नम्** food **भविष्यति** will be **इति** thus **आनन्दरूपाः** delightful **तिष्ठन्ति** remain (become).

  O Prāṇa, when thou pourest down rain, these creatures of thine are delighted, hoping that there will be food according to their desire.

**व्रात्यस्त्वं प्राणैकऋषिरत्ता विश्वस्य सत्पतिः।  
वयमाद्यस्य दातारः पिता त्वं मातरिश्वनः॥११॥**

**  प्राण** O Prāṇa **त्वम्** thou **व्रात्यः**a Vrātya **एकऋषिः** the Fire named Ekaṛṣi.**सन्**being**अत्ता**eater (enjoyer) (**तथा** likewise) **विश्वस्य** of the universe **सत्पत्तिः** the good lord (or the lord of existence) (**असि**thou art) **वयम्**we (**तव** thy) **आद्यस्य** of the edible **दातारः** givers. **त्वम्** thou **मातरिश्वनः** of the wind **पिता** father (or–**मातरिश्व** O Mātariśvan **त्वं**thou **नः**ours **पिता**father).

 Thou**¹** art a Vrātya O Prāṇa, and the Ekaṛṣi fire that enjoys (the offerings). Thou art the universal lord of existence. We are the givers of Thy food. Thou art, O air, our father.

 \[NOTES— *1. Thou art a Vrātya*— A person is called Vrātya for whom the Saṁskāras or the sacramental rites have not been performed, i.e., one who is ceremonially unclean. Prāṇa being the first born there was none to perform the Saṁskāras for him. Prāṅa is called Vrātya to indicate his inherent pure nature which requires no sacramental purification, and also the fact that he is the first born, the original source of the differentiated life. In Sanskrit rhetoric such expressions are called **निन्दास्तुति**i.e., praise in the language of blame.\]

**या ते तनूर्वाचि प्रतिष्ठिता या श्रोत्रे या च चक्षुषि।  
या च मनसि सन्तता शिवां तां कुरु मोत्क्रमीः॥१२॥**

  **ते** Thy **या** which **तनूः**body **वाचि** in speech **प्रतिष्ठिता** is established **या**which **श्रोत्रे**in the ear **या**which **च**and **चक्षुषि** in the eyes (**प्रतिष्ठिता** is established); **या** which **च** also **मनसि** in the mind **सन्तता** pervades, **ताम्** that **शिवाम्** propitious **कुरु** do; **मा** do not **उत्क्रमीः** go away.

  Make propitious that**¹** body of Thine which exists in speech, in the ear, in the eye, and also which pervades the mind; do not go away.

  \[NOTES— *1. That body of Thine*— i.e., that expression of thine.

  It will be explained further by the Śruti itself in III-5. Vide also the note on II-3.\]

**प्राणस्येदं वशे सर्वं त्रिदिवे यत् प्रतिष्ठितम्।  
मातेव पुत्रान् रक्षस्व श्रीश्च प्रज्ञां च विधेहि न इति॥१३॥**

  **त्रिदिवे** in the three worlds **यत्** whatever **प्रतिष्ठितम्** exists **इदम्** this **सर्वम्** all **प्राणस्य** of Prāṇa **वशे** under the control (**वर्तते** is). **माता** mother **पुत्रान्** the sons **इव** like (**अस्मान्** ourselves) **रक्षस्व** protect ; **नः** for us **श्रीः** affluence **प्रज्ञाम्** intelligence **विधेहि** give. **इति** thus.

  Whatever**¹**exists in the three worlds, is all under the control of Prāṇa. (O Prāṇa) protect us as a mother (protects) her sons; give us affluence and intelligence.

\[NOTES— *1. Whatever exists etc.*—Śaṅkarācārya has taken the first line to mean that 'all objects of this world are within the control of Prāṇa and also those objects of enjoyment that are in the third heaven of Gods.'\]

**END OF THE SECOND QUESTION**

**तृतीयः प्रश्नः THIRD QUESTION**

**  अथ हैनं कौसल्यश्चाश्वलायनः पप्रच्छ। भगवन् कुत एष प्राणो जायते कथमायात्यस्मिञ्छरीरे? आत्मानं वा प्रविभज्य कथं प्रातिष्ठते? केनोत्क्रमते? कथं बाह्यमभिधत्ते? कथमध्यात्ममिति॥१॥**

 **अथ** then **च** and **आश्वलायनः कौसल्यः** Āśvalāyana Kausalya **एनम्** him (Pippalāda) **पप्रच्छ** asked, **भगवन्** Sir, **एष** this **प्राणः** Prāṇa **कुतः** whence **जायते** is born? **कथम्** how**अस्मिन्** in this **शरीरे** body **आयाति** comes? **कथम्** how **आत्मानम्** himself **प्रविभज्य** having divided **प्रातिष्ठते** exists? **केन** by what means **उत्क्रमते** goes out? **कथम्** how **बाह्यम्** the outside (world) **अभिधत्ते** holds. **कथम्** how (**वा** also) **अध्यात्मम्** the internal **इति** thus (the question).

 And then Āśvalāyana Kausalya asked him: ‘Sir, whence is this Prāṇa born? How does he come into this body, and how does he exist (there) having divided himself (into five parts)? By what means does he go out? How does he hold the outside (world), and how the**¹** internal? '

 \[NOTES— *1. The Interna*l—i.e. the body, the senses, and the mind.\]

**  तस्मै स होवाचातिप्रश्नान् पृच्छसि ब्रह्मिष्ठोऽसीति तस्मात्तेऽहं ब्रवीमि॥२॥**

 **सः** he **तस्मै** to him (Kausalya) **उवाच** said–(**त्वम्** thou **अतिप्रश्नान्** more difficult questions **पृच्छसि**) askest (**अतः** therefore) **ब्रह्मिष्ठः** supremely devoted to Brahman **असि** (thou) art. **तस्मात्** therefore **अहम्I** **ते** to thee **ब्रवीमि** shall tell.

  To him he said: 'Thou art asking more difficult questions. Thou art the greatest devotee of Brahman, so shall I tell it to thee.

  **आत्मन एष प्राणो जायते। यथैषा पुरुषे च्छायैतस्मिन्नेतदाततं मनोकृतेनायात्यस्मिञ्छरीरे॥३॥**

  **एषः** this **प्राणः** Prāṇa **आत्मनः** from the Ātman **जायते** is born. **यथा** as **पुरुषे** on man **छाया** shadow (**तथा** so) **एतत्** this (Prāṇa) **एतस्मिन्** on this (the Ātman) **आततम्**is spread out, **मनोकृतेन** by the act of the mind **अस्मिन्** in this **शरीरे** body **आयाति** comes.

  Of**¹**the Ātman is born this Prāṇa. Like the shadow on a man, it is spread out on That. It comes into the body by**²** the acts of the mind.

 \[NOTES— *1. Of the Ātman is born etc*.—Here is a clear indication that the Energy whose play is the whole creation, both internal and external, is born of the Ātman, and covers the Being just as a shadow spreads over a body, i.e. it has no separate existence apart from the Ātman, and it shrouds the real nature of the latter under its varied display, yet it is as non-essential as a shadow. This is called Māyā. It will be

  2. *By the acts of the mind*— i.e., according to the volitional efforts and desires of the mind. explained by the Śruti itself later on.\]

** यथा सम्राडेवाधिकृतान् विनियुङ्क्ते। एतान्ग्रामानेतान्ग्रामानधितिष्ठस्वेत्येवमेवैष प्राण इतरान् प्राणान् पृथक्पृथगेव सन्निधत्ते॥४॥**

 **यथा** as **सम्राट्** the emperor **एव** verily **अधिकृतान्** officials **एतान्** these **ग्रामान्** villages **एतान्** these **ग्रामान्** villages **अधितिष्ठस्व** do you reside in and rule **इति** thus **विनियुङ्क्ते**orders, **एवम्** so **एव** verily **एषः** this (the chief Prāṇa) **इतरान्** other **प्राणान्** Prāṇas **पृथक् पृथक्** separately **एव** indeed **सन्निधत्ते** engages.

  As an emperor orders his officials, saying 'Do you reside in and rule these villages and those', so does this (the chief Prāṇa), engage the other Prāṇas differently (in their different functions).

**  पायूपस्थेऽपानं चक्षुश्रोत्रे मुखनासिकाभ्यां प्राणः स्वयं प्रातिष्ठते मध्ये तु समानः। एषह्येतद्भुतमन्नं समं नयति तस्मादेताः सप्तार्चिषो भवन्ति॥५॥**

** पायूपस्थे** (**पायु-उपस्थ**) in the organs of excretion and generation **अपानम्** the Apāna **मुखनासिकाभ्याम्** along with mouth and nose**चक्षुःश्रोत्रे**in the eye and the ear **स्वयम्**himself **प्राणः** Prāṇa **प्रातिष्ठते** exists. **मध्ये** in the middle **तु**and **समानः**Samāna (lit. that which equalizes); **हि**as **एषः**this (Samāna) **एतत्**this **हुतम्**eaten (lit. offered) **अन्नम्** food **समम्** equally **नयति** carries (distributes). **तस्मात्** from that (Prāṇa) **एताः** these **सप्तार्चिषः** the seven flames **भवन्ति**become.

 The Apāna is in the organs of excretion and generation; in the eye and the ear as well as in the mouth and the nose, dwells the Prāṇa himself; and in the middle is Samāna, as it distributes**¹**the offered food equally to all parts. From it originate the**²**seven flames.

 \[NOTES—*1. Distributes the offered food etc*.—i.e., gets the food assimilated equally into the system by digestion.

  2. *The seven flames*—i.e., the seven organs of perception-two eyes, two ears, twoils; and the mouth.)

** हृदि ह्येष आत्मा। अत्रैतदेकशतं नाडीनां तासां शतं शतमेकैकस्यां द्वासप्ततिर्द्वासप्ततिः प्रतिशाखानाडीसहस्राणि भवन्त्यासु व्यानश्चरति॥६॥**

  'In the heart dwells the Ātman. There are (in the heart) a hundred-and-one nerves, in each of them there are a hundred, and each of these branch nerves again has seventy-two thousand nerves. In all these the Vyāna moves.

 \[NOTES— According to this passage, Vyāna is the Energy that works through the nervous system, and perhaps through arteries and veins also, during the circulation of blood. Sometimes the word **नाडी**is translated as artery. But it is not quite correct to do so; to the ancients, the difference between artery and nerve was not known; and we find them often confusing the functions of the two as of one and the same **नाडी.**\]

**अथैकयोर्ध्व उदानः पुण्येन पुण्यं लोकं नयति।

**  अथ** now **उदानः** the Udāna **एकया** by one (of them) **ऊर्ध्वः** upwards **पुण्येन** by virtuous deeds **पुण्यम् लोकम्** the virtuous world **नयति** carries **पापेन** by sinful acts **पापम्** the sinful world (**नयति** leads); **उभाभ्याम्** by both **एव** verily **मनुष्यलोकम्** the human world.

 'And then, through**¹** one of them the Udāna carries (the soul) to the virtuous**²** world by virtuous deeds, to the sinful world by the sinful**³** acts, and by**⁴** both to the world of men.

 \[NOTES— According to this section it is the Udāna Energy that carries the soul after death to the different worlds according to the good or bad Karma done by the soul in this world. Evidently then the Udāna is that subtle aspect of Prāṇa which not only pervades the whole system and sustains it but also controls the Liṅgaśarīra (the subtle body) in which the soul resides after leaving the physical body.

 *1. Through one of them*—i.e., through the Suṣumnā Nādī.

*2. Virtuous world*—i.e., heavens of gods.

 *3. Sinful world*—i.e., the nether worlds and such mean births as that of animals, insects, and plants.

 4. *By both*—i.e., when both sin and virtue are in balance state.\]

**    यच्चित्तस्तेनैष प्राणमायाति, प्राणस्तेजसा युक्तः। सहात्मना यथासंकल्पितं लोकं नयति॥१०॥**

 ** एषः** this (man) (**मरणकाले** at the time of death) **यश्चित्तः** whatever his thought (**भवति** becomes) **तेन** with that (thought) **प्राणम्** the (chief) Prāṇa **आयाति** comes. **प्राणः** the Prāṇa **तेजसा** with the Fire (Udāna) **युक्तः** (**सन्**) being united **आत्मना** the Ātman **सह** with **यथासंकल्पितम्** as desired **लोकम्** world **नयति** leads on.  
  'Whatever his thought (at the dying moment), with that he**¹** comes to the Prāṇa; the Prāṇa united with the Fire leads on with the Ātman^(**2**) unto the desired world.

  \[NOTES— *1. He comes to the Prāṇa etc.*— According to the Vedānta, the self of man is encased by five

sheaths, viz. (1) Annamayakośa (physical sheath), (2) Prāṇamayakośa (sheath of vital energy), (3) Manomayakośa (mental sheath), (4) Vijānamayakośa (sheath of intellect) and (5) Ānandamayakośa (sheath of primal nescience). These five again to go make the three bodies of man: the first forms the gross body (Sthūlaśarīra), the second, third and fourth constitute the subtle body (Liṅgaśarīra) and the fifth forms the causal body (Kāraṇaśarīra). When physically alive, the soul is in all these three bodies, the causal being situated within the subtle and the subtle in the gross. In death, the self still remaining within the causal and subtle bodies separates away from the physical, and it is the subtle that forms the vehicle of the soul in its transmigration. Hence the Śruti tells here that after death the Jīvātman comes to Prāṇa, i.e., in the Prāṇamayakośa of the subtle body with the mood of mind in which it was at the dying moment, and then moves on for a befitting reincarnation.

**END OF THE THIRD QUESTION**

**चतुर्थ प्रश्नः FOURTH QUESTION**

** अथ हैनं सौर्यायणी गार्ग्यः पप्रच्छ। भगवन्नेतस्मिन् पुरुषे कानि स्वपन्ति? कान्यस्मिञ्जाग्रति? कतर एष देवः स्वप्नान् पश्यति? कस्यैतत्सुखं भवति? कस्मिन्नु सर्वे संप्रतिष्ठिता भवन्तीति॥१॥**

** अथ** then **गार्ग्यः** of clan of Garga **सौर्यायणी** the grandson of Sūrya **एनम्** him (Pippalāda) **पप्रच्छ** asked **भगवन्** Revered Sir, **एतस्मिन्** in this **पुरुषे** man **कानि** what **स्वपन्ति** sleep ; **अस्मिन्** in him **कानि** what **जाग्रति** are awake **एषः** of these **कतरः** which **देवः** god (sense) **स्वप्नान्** dreams **पश्यति** see? **कस्य** whose **एतत्** this **सुखम्** happiness **भवति** becomes **कस्मिन्** on which **सर्वे** all **संप्रतिष्ठिताः** established **भवन्ति** are?

  Then Gārgya Sauryāyaṇin asked him : 'Revered Sir, what are they that sleep in man? and what again are awake in him? Of these which god sees dreams? whose is the happiness? on what again are all established?'

\[NOTES—The questioner wants to know what parts of man sleep in sleep, and what are awake in the

awakened state. In sleep again what in man dream the dream, and what enjoy the calm repose of the dreamless sleep. \]

  **तस्मै स होवाच। यथा गार्ग्य मरीचयोऽर्कस्यास्तं गच्छतः सर्वा एतस्मिन् स्तेजोमण्डल एकीभवन्ति। ताः पुनः पुनरुदयतः प्रचरन्त्येवं ह वै तत् सर्वं परे देवे मनस्येकीभवति। तेन तर्ह्येष पुरुषो न शृणोति, न पश्यति, न जिघ्रति, न रसयते, न स्पृशते, नाभिवदते, नादत्ते, नानन्दयते न विसृजते, नेयायते, स्वपितीत्याचक्षते॥२॥**

  **सः** he (Pippalāda) **तस्मै** to him **उवाच** said—**गार्ग्य** O Gārgya **यथा** as **अस्तं** **गच्छतः** the setting **अर्कस्य** of the sun **सर्वाः** all **मरीचयः** rays **एतस्मिन्** in this **तेजोमण्डले** circle of light (solar orb) **एकीभवन्ति** become united ; **पुनः** again **उदयतः** the rising (**अर्कस्य** of the sun)**ताः** those (rays) **पुनः** again **प्रचरन्ति** go out (radiate) **एवम्** so **ह** verily **तत्** that **सर्वम्** all (senses) **परे** higher **देवे** in god **मनसि** in mind **एकीभवति** become united. **तेन** thus **तर्हि** then **एषः** this **पुरुषः** man (being) **न शृणोति** hears not, **न पश्यति** sees not, **न जिघ्रति** smells not, **न रसयते** tastes not, **न स्पृशते** feels not, **न अभिवदते** speaks not, **न आदत्ते** takes not, **न** **आनन्दयते** enjoys not, **न विसृजते** evacuates not, **न इयायते** moves not, (**तदा** then) **स्वपिति** sleeps **इति** thus **आचक्षते** says (**जनाः** man).

  To him he said : 'As the rays of the setting sun, O Gārgya, become united in the orb of

light (the sun) and while rising they again go out, so (in sleep) all**¹**become one in the superior god, the mind; hence the man hears not, sees not, smells not, tastes not, feels not, speaks not, enjoys not, evacuates not, moves not; and they say "(he) sleeps".

  \[NOTES —*1. All become one etc.*—i.e., all the senses and organs (both motor and sensory) become dormant in the mind.\]

**प्राणाग्नय एवैतस्मिन् पुरे जाग्रति। गार्हपत्यो ह वा एषोऽपानो व्यानोऽन्वाहार्यपचनो यद्गार्हपत्यात् प्रणीयते प्रणयनादाहवनीयः प्राणः॥३॥**

 **एतस्मिन्** in this **पुरे** city (body) **प्राणाग्नयः**the fires of Prāṇa **एव** alone **जाग्रति** remain awake ; **एषः** this **अपानः** Apāna **वै** verily **गार्हपत्यः** the Gārhapatya fire ; **व्यानः** Vyāna **अन्वाहार्यपचनः** Anvāhāryapacana fire, **यत्** because **गार्हपत्यात्** from the Gārhapatya fire **प्रणयनात्** that from which it is taken **प्रणीयते** is taken **प्राण** Prāṇa **एव** alone **आहवनीयः** the Āhavanīya fire.

 'The fires of Prāṇa alone remain awake in this city. This Apana is the Gārhapatya fire, the Vyāna is the Anvāhāryapacana and the Prāṇa is the Āhavanīya fire since it is taken from the Gārhapatya fire.

 \[NOTES— In sleep although the senses remain dormant, the Prāṇas ever remain active. But the significance of comparing the Prāṇas to the fires is not very clear. In Agnihotra sacrifice, there are mainly three kinds of fires used, viz., (1) Anvāhāryapacana or Dakṣināgni (2) Gārhapatya and (3) Āhavanīya. The first fire is placed on the southern side and is used only for offering oblations to the forefathers. The second, the household fire, is kept constantly burning on an altar and all other fires are taken from it. The third is the fire into which all the oblations to gods are offered. śaṅkara says that as there are some similarities between the Agnis and Prāṇas, the analogy is drawn. Vyāna works in the nerve on the right side of the heart; so it is compared to the Dakṣina fire. Apāna remains active constantly in the lower part of the system. From it proceeds the Prāṇa in sleep; so the Apāna is called Gārhapatya fire. And like the Āhavanīya fire which is taken from the Gārhapatya, Prāṇa proceeds from Apāna; so it is compared to the former fire.\]

**  यदुच्छ्वासनिःश्वासावेतावाहुती समं नयतीति स समानः। मनो ह वाव यजमान इष्टफलमेवोदानः स एनं यजमानमहरहर्ब्रह्म गमयति॥४॥**

 **यत्** as **एतौ** these two **उच्छ्वासनिश्वासौ** expiration andinspiration **आहुती** two oblations **समम्** equally **नयति** takes **इति** thus **सः समानः** that Samāna (**होता** the Hotṛ priest). **मनः** the mind **ह** verily **यजमानः** the sacrificer **उदानः** the Udāna **एव** indeed **इष्टफलम्** the fruit of the

sacrifice **सः** he (the Udāna) **एनम्** this **यजमानम्** the sacrificer **अहरहः** every day **ब्रह्म** Brahman **गमयति** takes.  
  As it carries the two oblations of inspiration and expiration equally into the system, the Samāna is the Hotṛ; the mind is verily the sacrificer and the Udāna is the fruit of the sacrifice inasmuch as it takes the sacrificer every day to Brahman.**¹**  
  \[NOTES— *1. It takes . . . Brahman.*—Ordinarily there are three states of human consciousness— (1) the awakening state, when the physical world becomes the object of cognition, (2) the dreaming state, when dreams formed out of the impressions of the awakening state, are perceived, and (3) the state of dreamless deep sleep, when the content of consciousness is nothing of the sense world or its impressions, but a vague feeling of unconditioned being. There is a fourth state of consciousness known as Samādhi, when the consciousness of the being alone remains in its infinitude without its limiting adjuncts. The attainment of this consciousness means the realization of Brahman. The consciousness in deep sleep is very similar to this consciousness, the difference being only that the consciousness during deep sleep is vague and impermanent, while that in the latter is distinct, full of light, and permanent at least in its effect and impression. Hence the Śruti tells here that the Udāna takes the mind, the sacrificer, every day in deep sleep to Brahman, i.e., to a state which is very near to Brahman.\]

** अत्रैष देवः स्वप्ने महिमानमनुभवति। यद् दृष्टं दृष्टमनुपश्यति ; श्रुतं श्रुतमेवार्थमनुशृणोति ; देशदिगन्तरैश्च प्रत्यनुभूतं पुनः पुनः प्रत्यनुभवति दृष्टं चादृष्टं च श्रुतं चाश्रुतं चानुभूतं चाननुभूतं च, सच्चासच्च, सर्वं पश्यति सर्वः पश्यति॥५॥**  
 **एषः**this **देवः** god (mind) **अत्र** here **स्वप्ने** in dream **महिमानम्** grandeur (power) **अनुभवति** perceives (enjoys) **यत्** what **दृष्टम् दृष्टम्** whatever seen **अनुपश्यति** sees again, **श्रुतम् श्रुतम् एव** whatever heard **अर्थम्** object **अनुशृणोति,** hears again **देशदिगन्तरैः** in different places and quarters **च** also **प्रत्यनुभूतम्** perceived **पुनः पुनः** again and again **प्रत्यनुभवति** is perceived, **दृष्टम्** seen च and **अदृष्टम्** unseen**श्रुतम्** heard **अश्रुतम्** unheard **अनुभूतम्** perceived **अननुभूतम्** unperceived **च** and **सत्** real **असत्** unreal **सर्वम्** all **पश्यति,** sees (**स्वयमपि** itself) **सर्वः** all (**सन्** being) **पश्यति** sees.  
 Here, in this state, the god enjoys**¹** its power of dream—it sees again whatever has been seen before, hears whatever has been heard before, enjoys again what has been enjoyed in different places and quarters. Becoming all, it sees all that has been seen and unseen, heard and unheard, perceived and unperceived real and unreal.

  \[NOTES— When all the senses lie dormant in sleep, the mind builds up in dream a world of its own out of the impressions received in the awakened state and enjoys the visions. All the different component parts of a dream are impressions of actual experiences, obtained, it may be, in different times; but they are curiously and fantastically linked together in sleep, when the controlling power of both reason and will is absent, and so we find that we experience things in dream which we have never seen or heard in the waking state. But ordinary dreams can be better explained physiologically than by mere psychology, although there are dream-phenomena that directly prove the existence of psychic mind and the Liṅgaśarīra of man.  
  1. *Enjoys its power.*—i.e., unlike the awakening state, enjoys its single nature untrammelled by the senses.\]

**  स यदा तेजसाभिभूतो भवति, अत्रैष देवः स्वप्नान् न पश्यत्यथ तदैतस्मिञ्छरीरे एतत्सुखं भवति॥६॥**

 **सः** he (the mind) **यदा** when **तेजसा** with the power**अभिभूतः** overpowered **भवति** becomes **अत्र** here (in this condition) **एषः**this **देवः**god (the Jīvātman) **स्वप्नान्**the dreams **न पश्यति** does not see. **तदा** then **एतस्मिन् शरीरे** in this body **एतत्** this **सुखम्** bliss **भवति** becomes (is enjoyed).

  When the mind**¹** is overcome by power, the god (Jīva) sees not the dream,—then**²** in the body bliss is enjoyed.

  \[NOTES— *1. The mind is overcome by the power.*― In the original the word is 'tejasā' which means by 'the light' or 'by power.' Śaṅkarācārya explains it as light of the sun, which is called citta and is in the nerves,' but this does not elucidate the term. Ordinarily, the mind is conceived as a self-effulgent light lighting up everything it comes in contact with; but in deep sleep that self-effulgence of the mind is overpowered for the time being by some other power which might be of the Nature outside or of the body, and of a Tamasic kind.

  2. Then in the body etc.—i.e., the blissful, calm repose of the deep sleep, which has a ray of that beatific peace enjoyed in the super-conscious state.

can be lighted up, the Prāṇa and what is to be sustained—all these rest in the superior Ātman in deep sleep.

  \[NOTES— All the gross and subtle elements with their respective senses of perception, all the organs, both motor and sensory, all intellections, even the egoity, rest unmanifested in deep sleep in the Ātman. Then the Jiva remains in his Kāraṇa Sarīra, vested in Avidyā alone, without the further superimposition of her ramifications or products. In this sense, deep sleep can be said to be nearer to the native glory of the Ātman than even the awakening state.\]

He is established.......Supreme Ātman.*—The Jīvātman stands to the Paramātman, according to the Advaita Vedānta, as a portion of the sky enclosed bythe four walls of a room stands to the whole sky, or, as Śaṅkara tells in his commentary, as the myriads of sunimages reflected on different waters stand to the real The relation and division are only verbal and apparent and not real.

 The Dvaitins and Viśiṣtadvaitins might take this Śruti as an authority for their theory of Dualism, i.e., the Jīvātman and Paramātman are two different entities, the former being dependent upon the latter. But then the subsequent passages would appear hard to be reconciled to that view. Hence this passage is better explained in the Advaitic sense.\]

** परमेवाक्षरं प्रतिपद्यते, स यो ह वै तदच्छायमशरीरमलोहितं शुभ्रमक्षरं वेदयते; यस्तु सोम्य, स सर्वज्ञः सर्वो भवति॥१०॥ तदेष श्लोकः—**

** यः** who **ह वै** assuredly **तत्** that **अच्छायम्** the shadowless, **अशरीरम्**bodiless, **अलोहितम्**colourless (lit. not of red colour), **शुभ्रम्** pure **अक्षरम्** indestructible **वेदयते**

knows, **सः** he **परम्** the supreme **अक्षरम्** the indestructible **एव** verily **प्रतिपद्यते** attains. **सोम्य** my young friend **यः** **तु** and who again (**एवम्** **विद्वान्** has known thus) **सः** he **सर्वज्ञः** omniscient **सर्वः** all **भवति** becomes, **तत्** about that **एषः** the following **श्लोकः** verse **भवति** is.

  The Supreme Undecaying One, my young friend, he verily attains, who knows the indestructible, the pure, without**¹** shadow, colour**²**, or body. He becomes all and omniscient. There is the following verse about it.

  \[NOTES —*1. Without*—i.e., unshrouded by ignorance,*2. Colour*—i.e., devoid of all attributes.\]

**विज्ञानात्मा सह देवैश्च सर्वैः  
  प्राणा भूतानि संप्रतिष्ठन्ति यत्र।  
तदक्षरं वेदयते यस्तु सोम्य  
  स सर्वज्ञः सर्वमेवाविवेशेति॥११॥**

**  विज्ञानात्मा** the self of intellect (Buddhi) **सर्वैः**all **देवैः** gods (senses) **सह** with **प्राणाः** Prāṇas, **भूतानि** the elements **यत्र** in which **सम्प्रतिष्ठन्ति** rest, **सोम्य** my friend, **यः** who **तु** again **तत्** that **अक्षरम्** the imperishable **वेदयते** knows **सः** he **सर्वज्ञः** omniscient **सर्वम्** all **एव** verily **आविवेश** enters **इति** thus.

  My young friend, he who knows that Imperishable in Which rest the mind, the senses^(**1**)and the Prāṇas, verily becomes omniscient and enters into all.

  \[NOTES— *1. The senses and the Prāṇas*— Śaṅkarācārya explains 'Devas' in the text as gods like Agni, Indra, etc., who preside over the function of the senses, and Prāṇas' as the senses.

  *Enters into all*—i.e., realising himself as the Ātman, feels himself as existing in all.\]

**END OF THE FOURTH QUESTION**

**पञ्चमः प्रश्नः FIFTH QUESTION**

**  अथ हैनं शैब्यःसत्यकामः पप्रच्छ—स यो ह वै तद्भगवन् मनुष्येषु प्रायणान्तमोङ्कारमभिध्यायीत, कतमं वाव स तेन लोकं जयतीति। तस्मै स होवाच॥१॥**

 **अथ** then **शैब्यःसत्यकामः** Satyakāma, the son of Śibi **एनम्** him (Pippalāda) **पप्रच्छ** asked, **भगवन्** Venerable Sir, **मनुष्येषु** among men, **सःयः**he who **प्रायणान्तम्** until death **तत्** that **ओंकारम्** the Om **अभिध्यायीत** would meditate,. **सः**he **तेन** by that **कतमम्** which **लोकम्** world **जयति**conquers (attains). **इति** thus **तस्मै** to him **सः** he (Pippalāda) **उवाच**said **ह**verily.

 Then Satyakāma, the son of Śibi, asked him, ‘Venerable Sir, among men what world does he attain by that, who would meditate upon Om until death?' To him he replied:

**एतद् वै सत्यकाम परं चापरं च ब्रह्म यदोंकारः।**   
**तस्माद् विद्वानेतेनैवायतनेनैकतरमन्वेति॥२॥**

**  सत्यकाम** O Satyakāma, **एतत्** this **वै** verily **परम् च** superior **अपरम् च** and inferior **ब्रह्म** Brahman **यत्** what

**ओङ्कारः** Om **तस्मात्** therefore, **विद्वान्** the knower **एतेन** by this **आयतनेन** means **एकतरम्** one of the two **अन्वेति** attains.

  What is Om, O Satyakāma, is verily the higher**¹** and the lower Brahman. Therefore the knower attains either of the two by this means.

  \[NOTES—*1. Higher and lower Brahman*.—i.e., the supreme, unmanifested, absolute Brahman, and the manifested Hiraṇyagarbha.  
  Om being the all-comprehensive sound-symbol of Brahman, it represents the manifested state of Brahman by its audible sound, and the unmanifested by its inaudible, unexpressed form, known as the **अर्धमात्रा** or **कलातीता**\]

  **स यद्येकमात्रमभिध्यायीत स तेनैव संवेदितस्तूर्णमेव जगत्यामभिसंपद्यते। तमृचो मनुष्यलोकमुपनयन्ते, स तत्र तपसा ब्रह्मचर्येण श्रद्धया संपन्नो महिमानमनुभवति॥३॥**

**  सः** he **यदि** if **एकमात्रम्** the one syllable (i.e., A) **अभिध्यायीत** meditates upon, **सः** he **तेन** by that **एव** alone **संवेदितः** being enlightened **तूर्णम्** quickly **एव** verily **जगत्याम्** into this world **अभिसम्पद्यते** comes back (is reborn). **ऋचः** the Ṛk (ie, the first mātrā A) **तम्** him **मनुष्यलोकम्** the world of man **उपनयन्ते** take. **सः** he **तत्र** there **तपसा** with Tapas (austerity) **ब्रह्मचर्येण** with continence, **श्रद्धया** with faith **सम्पन्नः** being endowed **महिमानम्** greatness **अनुभवति** gets.

  If he meditates upon the one syllable, he comes back to this world very soon (after his death) being enlightened by that. Ṛks take him to the world of man, where he attains the greatness (in life) being endowed with austerity, continence, and faith.

 **अथ यदि द्विमात्रेण मनसि सम्पद्यते सोऽन्तरिक्षं यजुर्भिरुन्नीयते सोमलोकम्। स सोमलोके विभूतिमनुभूय पुनरावर्तते॥४॥**

 **अथ** again, **यदि** if **द्विमात्रेण** by two syllables (A+U) (**अभिध्यायीत** meditated **तदा** then) **मनसि** in mind **सम्पद्यते** attains (becomes united), **सः**he **यजुर्भिः**by the Yajus **अन्तरिक्षम्** in the sky **सोमलोकम्** the world of the moon **उन्नीयते** is taken up. **सः** he **सोमलोके** in that world of the moon **विभूतिम्** grandeur (objects of enjoyment) **अनुभूय** having enjoyed **पुनः** again **आवर्त्तते** returns.

  If, again, one meditates upon the two syllables, one is united**¹**with the mind (after death). He is taken to the world of the moon in the sky, and there in that world of the moon, having enjoyed its grandeur, comes back again (into this world).

  \[NOTES— *1. United with the mind*—i.e., remains in his Śūkṣmaśarīra, the mental body.\]

  **यः पुनरेतं त्रिमात्रेणौमित्येतेनैवाक्षरेण परं पुरुषमभिध्यायीत स तेजसि सूर्ये संपन्नः। यथा पादोदरस्त्वचा विनिर्मुच्यत एवं ह वै स पाप्मना विनिर्मुक्तः स सामभिरुन्नीयते ब्रह्मलोकं स एतस्माज्जीवघनात्परात्परं पुरिशयं पुरुषमीक्षते॥५॥ तदेतौ श्लोकौ भवतः—**

  **यः** who **पुनः** again **एतम्** this (Om) **त्रिमात्रेण** with the three syllables (A+U+M) **ओम्** Om **इति** thus **एतेन** by this **अक्षरेण** letter **परम्** the Supreme **पुरुषम्** Puruṣa (Being) **अभिध्यायीत** would meditate **सः** he **तेजसि** in the light **सूर्ये** in the sun **सम्पन्नः** becomes united. **यथा** as **पादोदरः** serpent **त्वचा** from the skin (slough) **विनिर्मुच्यते**is freed **एवम्** like that **ह वै** verily **सः** he **पाप्मना** from sins **विनिर्मुक्तः** becomes free. **सः** he **सामभिः** by the Sāma hymns **उन्नीयते** is elevated to **ब्रह्मलोकम्** the world ofBrahmā. **सः** he **एतस्मात्** from this **जीवघनात्** the Macrocosmic Soul (Hiraṇyagarbha) **परम्** the Supreme **पुरिशयम्** existing in the heart, **पुरुषम्** the Puruṣa **ईक्षते** beholds. **तत्** about that **एतौ** these **श्लोकौ** two verses **भवतः** are.

  Again, he who meditates upon the Supreme Puruṣa with the letter Om, constituted of three moras becomes**¹**united with the effulgent Sun. He is freed from all sins, even as a snake is freed from its slough. He is taken up to the world of Brahmā by the Sāma hymns. From

that Macrocosmic Self he beholds the Supreme Puruṣa residing in the heart. There are the two following verses about it:

  \[NOTES— *1. Becomes united etc.*—i.e., he attains the path of Kramamukti.\]

 **तिस्रो मात्रा मृत्युमत्यः प्रयुक्ता अन्योन्यसक्ता अनविप्रयुक्ताः। क्रियासु बाह्याभ्यन्तरमध्यमासु सम्यक्प्रयुक्तासु न कम्पते ज्ञः॥६॥**

 **तिस्रः** the three **मात्राः**Mātrās (moras) (**एकैकशः**separately) **प्रयुक्ताः** employed (**चेत्** if) **मृत्युमत्यः**are mortal. **अन्योन्यसक्ताः** when attached to one another **अनविप्रयुक्ताः** not wrongly employed (**भवति** becomes) **बाह्याभ्यन्तरमध्यमासु**in the external, internal, and the middle **क्रियासु**functions. **सम्यक्** properly **प्रयुक्तासु** when employed **ज्ञः** the knower **न कम्पते**does not tremble.

  The Three Mātrās when**¹** employed separately are mortal; but when**²** they are connected with one another, they are not wrongly employed. When**³** they are properly employed, in all the**⁴** internal, external, and middle functions, the knower trembles**⁵** not.

  \[NOTES— *1. When employed separately etc*.—when each of the three mātrās A U M, is taken separately and meditated upon, the contemplator has to be born again and again in this world as explained in V. 3. 4.

  2. *When they are connected with one another etc.*—i.e., when all the three 'mātrās are blended together in significance and sound, they truly represent the universal Brahman, and when thus meditated upon, they bear the proper fruit as described in the previous section.

 3. *When they are properly employed*—i.e., properly meditated upon.

 4. *The internal, external, and middle functions*— i.e., in sleeping, waking, and dreaming states.

 5.*Trembles not*—i.e., does not waver from the consciousness of the Ātman or from the meditation.\]

**ऋग्भिरेतं यजुर्भिरन्तरिक्षं सामभिर्यत्तत्कवयो वेदयन्ते। तमोंकारेणैवायतनेनान्वेति विद्वान् यत्तच्छान्तमजरममृतमभयं परं चेति॥७॥**

 **ॠग्भिः**by the Ṛks (i.e., the first mātrā) **एतम्**this (i.e., the world of man) **यजुभिः**by the Yajus (i.e., by the second mātrā) **अन्तरिक्षम्**the sky (i.e., the world of the Moon situated in the sky) **सामभिः**by the Sāmans (i.e., by the third mātrā along with the first two) **यत्** what **कवयः** the wise **वेदयन्ते** know (**तत्** that **ब्रह्मलोकम्** the world of Brahmā **आप्नोति** attains) **यत्** what **शान्तम्** peaceful **अजरम्** undecaying **अमृतम्** immortal **अभयम्** free from all fear **परम्**supreme **तम्**that (Brahman) **विद्वान्** the sage **ओङ्कारेण** by Om **आयतनेन** means **एव**only **अन्वेति**gets united with. **च**and **इति**thus.

  By the Ṛk hymns this world is attained, by Yajus the sky (the world of the moon), and by

the Sāmans, is attained that which is known to the wise only. What is peaceful, undecaying, immortal, free from all fear and supreme, the sage also attains by means of this Om.

  \[NOTES— The sound OM is produced by the combination of the three sounds A, U and M. These are the three mātrās of OM; further there is the Ardhamātrā, or the inaudible sound which still lingers even when the audible sound dies away, and which can be detected only by fine perception and concentration.

  It is held that OM is the sound-symbol of Brahman, and so it is said to be the first sound produced at the beginning of creation. From the three mātrās of OM came out the 'feet' of Gāyatrī, and from the three 'feet' came out the three Vedas and the three worlds or Vyāhṛtis; From **अ** came out **'तत् सवितुर्वरेण्यं’**expanded itself into the Ṛgveda, from **उ,** **’भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि'** ' which expanded itself into Yajurveda, and from **म्, 'धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्'** which expanded itself into Sāmaveda. The first is **स्तुतिपर**(hymnal), the second is **क्रियापर** (devoted to work ), and the third is **ज्ञानपर** (devoted to knowledge).

  So by the meditation upon the different mātrās different ends are attained according to the significations of the mātrās. But when the mind is concentrated upon the Ardhamātrā, the Supreme Brahman is realized. This has been indicated by the latter half of this section. For further information vide Swāmi Vivekānanda's *Bhaktiyoga*.\]

**END OF THE FIFTH QUESTION**

**षष्ठः प्रश्नः SIXTH QUESTION**

**  अथ हैनं सुकेशा भारद्वाजः पप्रच्छ। भगवन् हिरण्यनाभः कौसल्यो राजपुत्रो मामुपेत्यैतं प्रश्नमपृच्छत— षोडशकलं भारद्वाज पुरुषं वेत्थ? तमहं कुमारमब्रुवं नाहमिमं वेद यद्यहमिममवेदिषं कथं ते नावक्ष्यमिति। समूलो वा एष परिशुष्यति योऽनृतमभिवदति। तस्मान्नार्हाम्यनृतं वक्तुम्। स तूष्णीं रथमारुह्य प्रवव्राज। तं त्वा पृच्छामि क्वासौ पुरुष? इति॥१॥**

 **अथ** next **ह** verily **भारद्वाजः सुकेशा** Sukeśas of the Bhāradvāja Gotra **एनम्** him (Pippalāda) **पप्रच्छ** asked ; **भगवन्** holy sir, **कौसल्यः** of Kosala **हिरण्यनाभः** Hiraṇyanābha **राजपुत्रः** the prince **माम्** me **उपेत्य** having approached **एतम्** this **प्रश्नम्** question **पप्रच्छ** asked : **भारद्वाज** O Bhāradvāja, **षोडशकलम्** of sixteen parts **पुरुषम्** Puruṣa **वेत्थ** do (you) know? **अहम्** I **तम्** that **कुमारम्** prince **अब्रुवम्** said, **अहम्** I **इमम्** this **न वेद** do not know. **अहम्** I **यदि** if **इमम्** this **अवेदिषम्** had known (**तर्हि** then ) **ते** to thee**कथम्** why **न** not **अवक्ष्यम्** have told? **इति** thus **यः** who **अनृतम्** falsehood **वदति** tells **एषः** this one **वै**verily **समूलः**with the whole root **परिशुष्यति**dries up (is destroyed);

**तस्मात्** therefore **अनृतम्** falsehood **वक्तुम्** to tell **न अर्हामि**I do not deserve. **सः** he (the prince) **तूष्णीम्** silently **रथम्** the chariot **आरुह्य** having ascended **प्रवव्राज** went away **त्वां**to thee **तम्** that **पृच्छामि** I ask **असौ** this **पुरुषः** Puruṣa **क्व**where, **इति**thus.

  Next, Sukeśa of the clan of Bhāradvāja asked him: 'Venerable Sir, Hiraṇyanābha, the prince of Kosala, came to me and put me the question, "Well Bhāradvāja, do you know the Puruṣa who is of sixteen parts?" I replied to the Prince, "I do not know him; had I known him, why should I not tell it to thee? He who tells a lie, perishes, root and all; so it behoves me not to tell a lie." He got into his chariot and went away. So I ask thee where is that Puruṣa ?'

**  तस्मै स होवाच । इहैवान्तःशरीरे सोम्य स पुरुषो यस्मिन्नेताः षोडशकलाः प्रभवन्तीति॥२॥**

**  तस्मै** to him **सः** he **ह** verily **उवाच** said, **सोम्य** my young friend **सः** that **पुरुषः** the Puruṣa **इह** here **अन्तःशरीरे** within this body (**वर्त्तते** exists) **यस्मिन्** in which **एताः** these **षोडशकलाः** the sixteen parts **प्रभवन्ति** arise.  
  To him he said: 'Here, within this body, my friend, exists that Puruṣa, from which arise the sixteen parts.'

  \[NOTE— Here it is stated that the Puruṣa, the Ātman of which more will be spoken in the subsequent sections is within this body; but the statement should not be taken in too strict a sense. As the Ātman is generally perceived first as our own very self, which animates this body, it is spoken of as existing within this body. In reality He is all-pervading, unrestricted by space-limit.\]

**  स ईक्षांचक्रे। कस्मिन्नहमुत्क्रान्त उत्क्रान्तो भविष्यामि कस्मिन् वा प्रतिष्ठिते प्रतिष्ठास्यामीति॥३॥**

 **सः** he **ईक्षाञ्चक्रे** thought **कस्मिन् उत्क्रान्ते** who having gone out **अहम्** I (**अपि** also) **उत्क्रान्तः**gone out **भविष्यामि** shall become. **कस्मिन् प्रतिष्ठिते** who being established **प्रतिष्ठास्यामि** shall be established (in this body).

  He reflected: By whose going out shall I go out and by whose stay again shall I stay (in this body).

 **स प्राणमसृजत। प्राणाच्छ्रद्धां खं वायुर्ज्योतिरापः पृथिवीन्द्रियं मनः। अन्नमन्नाद्वीर्यं तपो मन्त्राः कर्मलोकाः लोकेषु च नाम च॥४॥**

 **सः** he (the Puruṣa) **प्राणम्** the Prāṇa (Hiraṇyagarbha) **असृजत** created. **प्राणात्** from the Prāṇa **श्रद्धाम्** faith **खम्** ether, **वायुः** air, **ज्योतिः** fire, **आपः** water, **पृथिवी** earth, **इन्द्रियम्** the senses, **मनः** the mind, **अन्नम्** food, **अन्नात्** from food **वीर्यम्** vigour (strength), **तपः** penance, **मन्त्राः**

the Vedas, **कर्म** the Yajñas, **लोकाः** the worlds, **लोकेषु** in the worlds **च**again **नाम**name **च**also (**असृजत** created).

  He created the Prāṇa; from the prāṇa came out faith**¹**, ether, air, fire, water, earth, the senses, the mind, and food. From**²** food came vigour, penance, the Vedas, the Yajñas, and the worlds. And in the worlds again was created Name.

  \[NOTES— The sixteen categories enumerated here are the sixteen Kalās or parts belonging to the Puruṣa referred to in the previous sections. The cosmology is rather loosely described here.

  1. *Faith* — Śraddhā is the word used in the text, and it has been explained as Āstikyabuddhi, but it may very well be taken here for Buddhi itself.

  2. *From Food etc.*—Food produces vigour and strength in man, which again leads him to do different works, and for the enjoyments of the results of those works different worlds were created. Hence in this sense, it has been said that 'from food came vigour etc'.\]

**  स यथेमा नद्यः स्यन्दमानाः समुद्रायणाः समुद्रं प्राप्यास्तं गच्छन्ति भिद्येते तासां नामरूपे समुद्र इत्येवं प्रोच्यते एवमेवास्य परिद्रष्टुरिमाः षोडशकलाः पुरुषायणाः पुरुषं प्राप्यास्तं गच्छन्ति; भिद्येते तासां नामरूपे पुरुष इत्येवं प्रोच्यते स एषोऽकलोऽमृतो भवति॥५॥ तदेष श्लोकः—**

**  सः**that **यथा** as **समुद्रायणाः** coursing towards the ocean **स्यन्दमानाः** flowing **इमाः** these **नद्यः** rivers **समुद्रम्** the ocean **प्राप्य** having reached **अस्तम् गच्छन्ति** disappear, **तासाम्** their **नामरूपे** names and forms **भिद्येते** are obliterated, **समुद्रः** the ocean **इति** thus **एवम्** alone **प्रोच्यते** is spoken of ; **एवम्** so **एव** verily **अस्य** of this **परिद्रष्टुः** the seer of all things **पुरुषस्य** of the Puruṣa, **इमाः** these **पुरुषायणाः** resting in the Puruṣa, **षोडशकलाः** the sixteen kalās **पुरुषम्**the Puruṣa **प्राप्य**having reached **अस्तं गच्छन्ति** disappear, **तासाम्** of these **नामरूपे** the name and form **भिद्येते** are destroyed. **पुरुषः** the Puruṣa. **इति** thus **एवम्** alone **प्रोच्यते** is spoken of, **सः** that **एषः** this (person) **अकलः** devoid of Kalās **अमृतः** immortal **भवति** becomes **तत्** about that **एषः** the following **श्लोकः** verse **भवति** is.

  As the flowing rivers that tend towards the sea, having reached it, merge into the all their names and forms disappear and people speak only of the ocean, so the sixteen kalās of this Seer, the Puruṣa, resting in Him alone, having reached Him disappear in Him; their names and forms are destroyed and people speak of the Puruṣa only. Then He becomes devoid of kalās, and immortal. There is the following verse about it.

  \[NOTES—When all the sixteen kalās which are cognized in the ordinary 'ignorant' state are merged in

the Ātman in Samādhi by the practice of Yoga, then their existence is not perceived in the consciousness and the Conscious Principle, the Ātman, alone remains in its unalloyed glory.\]

**अरा इव रथनाभौ कला यस्मिन् प्रतिष्ठिताः।  
तं वेद्यं पुरुषं वेद यथा मा वो मृत्युः परिव्यथा इति॥६॥**

**  रथनाभौ** in the nave of the chariot **अराः** spokes **इव** like **कलाः** the Kalās **यस्मिन्** in whom **प्रतिष्ठिताः** are established **तम्** that **वेद्यम्** worth knowing **पुरुषम्** the Puruṣa **वेद** know **यथा** so that **मृत्युः** death**वः** ye **मा परिव्यथाः** may not hurt.

  In whom rest the kalās like spokes in the nave of a chariot-wheel, know Him, the Puruṣa, worthy to be known, that death might not hurt you.

  \[NOTE—The simile given here is very significant. As the spokes only rest on the nave but do not form an integral part of the same, so these kalās are not part of the Puruṣa in the real sense of the term; they are mere erections of His Māyāśakti, and as such, are dependent on Him.\]

**  तान् होवाचैतावदेवाहमेतत् परं ब्रह्म वेद। नातः परमस्तीति॥७॥**

  To them he said, 'So far I know of the Supreme Brahman; there is nothing higher than that.'

  Having worshipped him, they said, 'Thou art our father that hast taken us across the other shore of avidyā (ignorance).'
