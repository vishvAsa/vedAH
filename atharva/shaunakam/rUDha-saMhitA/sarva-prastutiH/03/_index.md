Book III.

⌊The third book is made up largely of hymns of 6 verses each. It
contains 13 such hymns, but also six hymns (namely 4, 7, 13, 16, 24, 30)
of 7 verses each, six hymns (namely 5, 6, 11, 15, 19, 29) of 8 verses
each, two hymns (namely 12, 17) of 9 verses each, two hymns (namely 20,
21) of 10 verses each, one hymn (namely 31) of 11 verses, and one hymn
(namely 10) of 13 verses. See Weber's introduction to his translation,
p. 178. The possibility of critical reduction to the norm is well
illustrated by hymn 31—compare pages 1 and 37. The whole book has been
translated by Weber, *Indische Studien*, vol. xvii. (1885), pages
177-314.⌋
