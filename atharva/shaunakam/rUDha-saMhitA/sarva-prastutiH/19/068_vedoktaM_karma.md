##### Comment
Found in Pāipp. xix. Quoted once in the text of Kāuś. (139. 10), in the ceremony of introduction to Vedic study, as to be murmured prior to pronouncing, by pādas, the Gāyatrī (RV. iii. 62. 10), and the Atharvan verses iv. 1. 1 and i. 1. 1 (or 1-4). But the various schol. (the Paddhati, Daś. Kar., Keśavī) make frequent mention and use of it: thus (see note to Kāuś. 25. 36), it is reckoned to a svastivācana; it is used in the sīmantonnayana (to 35. 20) and godāna (to 53. 2) ceremonies; it is added (note to 57. 22) to vii. 33. 1 in the ceremony of restoring lost fire, in the initiation of a Vedic student; it is used in the vedavratāni (to 57. 32), in the annaprāśana (to 58. 19), and the preparation for the marriage ceremonies (to 75. 1), and for the ājyatantra (to 137. 4), and in the introduction to the rājakarmāṇi of §14 (p. 315, l. 2). In all this is very probably to be seen only the influence of the occurrence of védam and of kármāṇi kṛṇmahe in the second half-verse; it need not imply any real comprehension of the obscure verse, with recognition of its appropriateness to all these various situations. ⌊As to the critical bearing of the uses of the vs. in the ritual, cf. the table on p. 896, and see p. 897, line 12.⌋

##### Translation
1. Of non-expansion and of expansion do I untie the aperture with magic;  
by those two having taken up the Veda, we then perform acts.

##### Notes
  
  
  
  
  
That is, doubtless, 'conduct sacred ceremonies.' All the mss.\* have at  
the beginning *ávyasas* (p. *ávi॰asaḥ*), and so have Ppp., the Anukr.,  
Kāuś. and all its scholiasts, and the comm.; whence of course also SPP.;  
it is unquestionably the Atharvan reading. Yet even the comm. can only  
say for it that it is the same as *avyacasas*, a syllable being omitted  
by Vedic license; and the analysis of the *pada*-text appears to be one  
of those wild and senseless guesses of which in this book it presents  
not a few examples. ⌊The important thing to observe in the pāda  
*avya*\[*ca*\]*saś ca vyacasaś ca* is the recurrence of so many  
confusingly similar syllables: the corruption is a case of haplography  
(cf. note to iv. 5. 5, and Bloomfield in AJP. xvii. 418); but one would  
expect *avyacaso vyacasaś ca*. The *pada*-mss. ⌊save SPP's J.⌋ have  
*víṣyāmi* in **b** as an integral word; but the comm. understands *ví:  
syāmi*, and SPP., as well as our text, so reads; many of the mss. have  
*bí* instead of *ví*. One accents in **c** *vedám*, ⌊and one has  
*vedam*, without accent; Griffith's 'bunch of grass' implies the reading  
*vedám* here and at 72. 1⌋; we might conjecture *védim* as a better  
reading; *véda* is not to be expected in the Atharvan. ⌊The *Index*  
gives for books i.-xviii. three occurrences of *véda*, namely at iv. 35.  
6; x. 8. 17; xv. 3. 7: at x. 8. 17 W. suggests that it is perhaps to be  
rendered simply by 'knowledge'; but in iv. and xv. it can hardly be  
aught else than 'Veda.'⌋ Some of the mss. accent *kṛṇmáhe*. There was no  
sufficient reason for altering the accent of *vyácasas* in our text to  
*vyacásas;* SPP. reads *vyác-* with the majority of his authorities. The  
comm. has no notion of what the verse really means: he gives two  
different expositions—one explaining *ávyacas* and *vyácas* to mean the  
two varieties of breathing, *prāṇa* and *vyāna*, the *bila* to be the  
*mūlādhāra*, and *veda* 'the Veda' (*akṣarātmakamantrasaṁgha*); the  
other taking the first two to be the *paramātman* and *jīvātman*, the  
*bila* the heart, and *veda* 'knowledge' (*cikīrṣitakarmaviṣayaṁ  
jñānam*). \*⌊If I understand the Collation Book, W's P. actually begins  
with *avyacásaś cá vyácasáś ca*, which, apart from the wild accents, is  
worth noting.⌋  
  
In Ppp., this hymn is immediately followed by our hymn 72.
