#### Comment
Of this hymn only the first verse occurs in Pāipp. (in xix.). The comm. reports no viniyoga, but SPP. supplies one, finding it quoted in Pariś. 37. 4, in a ceremony of expiation for the loss (nāśa) of a strainer; ⌊and again, in 37. 14, for use in case a certain earthen vessel (upayāma) falls from the hand⌋.

##### Translation
1. What that is defective (*chidrá*) of my mind, and what of my voice  
hath found (? *jagā́ma*) Sarasvatī enraged, let Bṛihaspati, in concord  
with all the gods, mend (*sam-dhā*) that.

##### Notes
The meaning of **b** is extremely doubtful. SPP. reads *sárasvatī*  
against the large majority of his authorities and all of ours, which  
have *-tīm*. Our *hárasvantam* was a conjecture, and perhaps not a  
particularly successful one. The translation given (tentatively) above  
implies *-tīm manyumatī́m*, while all the mss., the comm., and SPP., have  
*-mántam*. Ppp. reads *sarasvatī: manvavittaṁ jagāma*. Hardly a ms.  
gives an accent to *jagāma* (one of SPP's, probably by accident, and  
another, p.m.). Ppp. reads in **d** *sandadātu*. There are corresponding  
verses in VS. (xxxvi. 2) and Āp. (xiv. 16. 1), but they cast no light on  
**b**: VS. reads *yán me chidráṁ cákṣuṣo hṛ́dayasya mánaso vā́ ’titṛṇṇam  
bṛ́haspátir me tád dadhātu;* and Āp., *yan me manasaś chidraṁ yad vāco  
yac ca me hṛdaḥ: ayaṁ devo bṛhaspatiḥ saṁ tat siñcatu rādhasā*.

##### Translation
2. Do not ye, O waters, devastate (*pra-math*) our wisdom nor our  
*bráhman;* come ye flowing with easy flow, being invoked; \[be\] I of  
good wisdom, having splendor.

##### Notes
All the mss. accent *ā́pas* in **a**, and SPP. refuses to follow us in  
the obvious emendation to *āpas*, although the comm. also takes the word  
as vocative. At the end of **b**, the comm., followed by three of SPP's  
authorities, has *mathiṣṭa naḥ*. In **c**, the mss. read *śuṣyadā́* (p.  
the same), and the comm. understands it as *śuṣyat: ā;* SPP. emends by  
conjecture to *suṣyadā́s* (p. *su॰syadā́ḥ*), which is decidedly more  
successful than our *śuṣmadā́s*. The translation, however, ventures to  
emend yet further, to *suṣyádā́* (p. *su॰syádā: ā́*). Most of the mss.  
give *syannadhvam;* ⌊W's O. and SPP's carefully corrected Dc., s.m.,⌋  
join with the comm. in *syanda-*, which stands in both printed texts.  
The translation, finally, implies our reading *úpahūtās*, against the  
mss., SPP., and the comm., which give *-tas* (*-to ‘ham*); against,  
also, the Anukr.,\* but making much better meter than if **c** is ended  
with *syandadhvam*. The mss. and SPP. have *sumédhās* (the *p.*-mss.  
wrongly *su॰médhā*); ⌊in the edition⌋ we ⌊should have⌋ rectified the  
accent ⌊so as to read⌋ *sumedhā́s*. \*⌊The Anukr. would scan as 6 + 8: 8  
+ 12; the Berlin text as 6 + 8: 12 + 8.⌋

##### Translation
3. Do not ye injure our wisdom, nor our consecration, nor what ardor  
(*tápas*) is ours; be they propitious to us in order to \[prolonged\]  
life-time; let them become \[our\] propitious mothers.

##### Notes
The mss. have in **b** *hiṅsiṣṭam*, and SPP. does not follow our  
obviously acceptable emendation to *-ṣṭa*. The comm., too, has *-ṣṭam*,  
and explains it by calling ⌊into service⌋ that everlasting pair  
*dyāvāpṛthivī;* but, as alternative, he apparently goes on to anticipate  
the pair of Aśvins from vs. 4; there is, however, a lacuna in the sole  
manuscript, cutting off this explanation almost at the beginning. In  
**c**, the mss. all have *sáṁsvanta ā́y-* (p. *sám॰svantaḥ!*), but the  
comm. *śaṅsantu*, explaining it as = *stuvantu;* ⌊SPP. reports that the  
text of the comm. is *śaṁsantu* and that the sole ms. of the commentary  
has actually *santu;*⌋ SPP. takes this, and alters it to *śáṁ santu;*  
our emendation to simple *santu*, suiting both sense and meter, is  
obviously to be accepted. The *pada*-mss. in general give *śivā́* in  
**c**; ⌊but one of W's and one of SPP's, each s.m., have *śivā́ḥ*;⌋ they  
all ⌊except perhaps W's L.⌋ have *śivā́ḥ* in **d**. There is no good  
reason why the Anukr. should call the verse *bṛhatīgarbhā*, since **c**  
can be read as eight syllables in either form.

Mar not our consecrating rite, our intellect, or fervent zeal. Gracious to us for lengthened life, propitious let the Mothers be.

##### Translation
4. That food (? *íṣ*) O Aśvins, which, full of light, shall make us  
pass through the darkness, may ye give (*rā*) to us.

##### Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. i. 46. 6, and is translated from the RV.  
text, the AV. version being utterly corrupt, and offering a very  
noteworthy measure of what this nineteenth book can do in the way of  
corruption even of a text that is intelligibly handed down elsewhere.  
The ms. reading is *mā́ naḥ píparid aśvinā jyótiṣmatī támas tiráḥ: tā́m  
asmāí rāsatām íṣum*. Our text differs from that of RV. only by reading  
*pī́parid* (which is an oversight for the *pī́parad* ⌊*Grammar* §869 c⌋ of  
the RV.) and *rāsathām* (which is bad); ⌊RV. has *rāsāthām*, to be taken  
as augmentless *s*-aorist, 2d person dual middle⌋. The comm. differs  
from RV. by giving *mā́* at the beginning; ⌊his text, furthermore, has  
*rāsātām;* but his comment has *rāsāthām*, like RV.⌋; he understands  
*aśvinā* correctly as vocative. SPP. clings to *rāsatām*, and thinks to  
make it answer by accenting *aśvínā* (on the authority, ⌊probably⌋  
accidental, of a single ms.). ⌊I suppose Whitney means to imply that, if  
SPP. intends to make *rāsatām* a 3d person dual imperative middle of the  
*s*-aorist, but from an *a*-stem, as explained at *Grammar* §896, the  
form ought to be *rāsetām*, corresponding to the 3d singular *rāsatām*  
there noticed.⌋ There is really no way but to adopt the RV. text  
throughout; any attempt at compromise simply spoils the verse. The comm.  
takes *mā pīparat* as *pāram mā gamayatu*, and **b** as its antithesis,  
supplying *karotu* to *tiras;* and he refers at the end to *yā* as read  
*śākhāntare* (i.e., in RV.).
