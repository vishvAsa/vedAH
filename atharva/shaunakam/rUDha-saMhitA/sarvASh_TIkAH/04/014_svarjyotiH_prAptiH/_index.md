### Comment
Found also in VS. (xiii. 51), MS. (ii. 7. 17; like VS. throughout), and TS. (iv. 2. 104). VS. and MS. have in c, d devátām ágram āyaṅs téna róham āyann úpa médh-. TS. has at the beginning ajā́, and, correspondingly, sā́ (with vāí added) in b, and táyā in c and d; it also reverses the order of c and d, agreeing otherwise with VS. MS. in d, but having ágre, like AV., in c; it also replaces śókāt by gárbhāt in a. We have a again below as ix. 5. 13 a; and c is nearly equivalent to iii. 22. 3 c: moreover the pada-mss., here as there, misinterpret āyaṅ before téna as āyam, which SPP. properly corrects to āyan in his pada-text; all our saṁhitā-mss. read āyaṅ. The comm. declares hí in a to be intended to intimate that the same statement was made in another text also; and he quotes TS. ii. 1. 14; róha he explains by svargādiloka; téna he takes both times as designating the means. The Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable in b. ⌊As to ajá, see Weber, Berliner Sb., 1895, p. 847 n.⌋
