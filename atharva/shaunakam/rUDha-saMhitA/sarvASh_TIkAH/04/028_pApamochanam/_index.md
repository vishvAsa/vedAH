### Comment
Found in Pāipp. iv. (next after our h. 26), but having nothing correspondent to it in the Yajur-Veda texts. Having the same beginning (bhavāśarvāu) as xi. 2. 1, one cannot tell in many cases which of the two hymns is intended by a quotation in Kāuś.; but according to the comm. (also to Keśava; Dārila appears to think otherwise) this one is employed in a healing ceremony at 28. 8; it is also reckoned (26. 1, note) to the takmanāśana gaṇa.


### Translations
Translated: Muir, OST. iv.2 332; Griffith, i. 169; Bloomfield, 158, 406; Weber, xviii. 111.
