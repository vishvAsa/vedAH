### Comment
Not found in Pāipp., but is, with a few insignificant variants, RV. x. 125 (but in the verse-order 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 7, 8), a hymn ascribed by the tradition to Vāc Āmbhṛṇī, or
'Speech, daughter of Ambhṛṇa'; but there is an utter absence in the details of anything distinctly pointing to speech, and we can only believe that the attribution is an old conjecture, a suggested solution of a riddle, which "space," or "faith," or "right"
(ṛtá) would have equally satisfied. But the explanation is universally accepted among Hindu authorities, old and new, and hardly questioned by European scholars. The hymn is used by Kāuś. in the ceremony (10. 16-9) for generation of wisdom (medhājanana), being said over a child before taking of the breast, and also at its first use of speech; also in the same ceremony as forming part of the upanayana (57. 31) ⌊so the comm. and Keśava: but the hymn is not included in the āyuṣya gaṇa⌋; and again in the dismissal ⌊utsarjana, says the comm.⌋ from Vedic study (139. 15). ⌊With regard to the intention of Kāuś. 139. 15 the reader may consult Whitney's notes to the passages there cited by pratīka.⌋


### Translations
Translated: by Colebrooke, Asiatick Researches, vol. viii, Calcutta, 1805, or Miscellaneous Essays, i.2 p. 28 (Whitney, in his notes to this essay, l.c., p. 113, gives a "closer version," "in the original metre," and with an introduction); translated, further, by the RV. translators; and also by Weber, in his article, Vāc und λόγος, Ind. Stud. ix. (1865) 473; Deussen, Geschichte, i. 1. 146 f.; Griffith, i. 171; Weber, xviii. 117. Here Weber gives references to discussions by himself, by Garbe, and by Max Müller, of the possible connection of the Neo-Platonic λόγος-idea with Indic thought.
