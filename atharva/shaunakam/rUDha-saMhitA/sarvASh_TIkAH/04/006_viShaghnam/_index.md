### Comment
The absence of this verse in Ppp., and the normal length of the hymn without it, together with its own senselessness, suggest strongly the suspicion of its unoriginality. To put meaning into it, the comm. maintains that the serpents have castes, as men have; and that their primal Brahman was Takṣaka.
