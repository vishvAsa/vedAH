### Comment
Found (except vs. 5) in Pāipp. iv. Used by Kāuś. (58. 9) in the same ceremony with the preceding hymn, but with an amulet of mother-of-pearl; the schol. (not the comm.) also add it in an earlier part of the ceremony (56. 17). The comm. quotes it further from Nakṣ. K. (19), as employed in a mahāśānti named vāruṇī.


⌊Although rain-drops are not expressly mentioned in this hymn nor in xix. 30. 5 (which see), I think it safe to say that the bit of Hindu folk-lore about the origin of pearls by transformation of rain-drops falling into the sea (Indische Sprüche, 344) is as old as this Vedic text and the one in xix. The references here to sky and sea and lightning, and in xix. to Parjanya and thunder and sea, all harmonize perfectly with that belief, which is at least ten centuries old (it occurs in Rājaśekhara, 900 A.D.) and has lasted till today (Manwaring's Marāṭhī Proverbs, no. 1291). See my translation of Karpūra-mañjarī, p. 264 f., and note 5. Pischel, l.c., reports as follows: "According to Aelian (περὶ ζῴων, x. 13), a pearl forms when the lightning flashes into an open seashell; according to an Arabic writer, when rain-drops fall into it, or, according to Pliny (ix. 107), dew."—The persistency of popular beliefs in India is well illustrated by the curious one concerning female snakes: see my note to Karpūra-mañjarī, p. 231.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 462; Grill, 36, 124; Griffith, 1. 142; Bloomfield, 62, 383; Weber, xviii. 36.—Bloomfield cites an article in ZDMG. (xxxvi. 135) by Pischel, who, in turn, cites a lot of interesting literature about pearl.
