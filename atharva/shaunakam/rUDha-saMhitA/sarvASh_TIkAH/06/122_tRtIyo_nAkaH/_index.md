### Comment
Verses 2, 3 are found in Pāipp. xvi. ⌊For vss. 1-3, cf. v. Schroeder, Zwei Hss., p. 15, Tübinger Kaṭha-hss., pp. 75-76.⌋ It appears in Kāuś., with the hymn next following,* in the savayajñas (63. 29), accompanying the offering of saṁsthitahomas; and the comm. regards vs. 5 (instead of xi. i. 27, which has the same pratīka) as intended at 63. 4, in the same ceremonies, with distribution of water for washing the priests' hands. Vāit. (22. 23) has both hymns in the agniṣṭoma, with vii. 41. 2, as recited by the sacrificer. ⌊For the whole anuvāka, see under h. 114.⌋ *⌊And with x. 9. 26.⌋
