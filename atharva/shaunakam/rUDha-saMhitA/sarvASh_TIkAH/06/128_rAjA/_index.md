### Comment
Except the third verse, this hymn occurs also in Pāipp. xix. Besides the ceremony reported under vs. 1, Kāuś. has the hymn (50. 13) in a general rite for good fortune, with vi. 1, 3-7, 59, etc. etc.; and also, in the chapter of portents (100. 3), in an expiatory ceremony on occasion of an eclipse of the moon (somagrahaṇa, comm.); vs. 3, too, is specially quoted in the aṣṭakā ceremony (138. 8), as accompanying a nineteenth [oblation?].


### Translations
Translated: Weber, Omina und Portenta (1858), p. 363; Zimmer, p. 353; Griffith, i. 316; Bloomfield, 160, 532.—Bloomfield had already treated it at length, AJP. vii. 484 ff., and JAOS. xiii. p. cxxxiii (= PAOS., Oct. 1886). A pencilled note on Whitney's ms. shows that he considered the propriety of rewriting the translation and comment for vi. 128.
