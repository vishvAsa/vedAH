### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix., in the verse-order 1, 3, 2. The hymn is reckoned by Kāuś. (9. 2) to the bṛhachānti gaṇa; it is used (25. 20) in healing rites against various diseases, and (25. 21) especially against disorders arising from soma drinking; and (41. 14), with hymn 19 and others, in a ceremony for good fortune; it is further (note to 7. 14) one of the apāṁ sūktāni. Vāit. (30. 7) has it in the sāutrāmaṇī ceremony with the preparation of surā for one disordered by soma. ⌊Keśava (to 61. 5) counts this hymn (not 57) to a pavitra gaṇa.⌋
