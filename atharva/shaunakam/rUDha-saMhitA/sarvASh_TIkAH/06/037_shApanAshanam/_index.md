### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. Quoted by Kāuś. (48. 23) in a witchcraft ceremony (against the effect of an opponent's sorcery, comm.), with giving a pale lump (piṇḍam pāṇḍum: the comm. explains it as a lump of white dirt) to a dog; and vs. 3 is, doubtless correctly, regarded by the comm. as intended at 48. 37 (the pratīka would equally designate vii. 59), with the laying on of fuel from a tree struck by lightning. The hymn is further reckoned (note to 25. 36) to the svastyayana gaṇa.
