### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. Further, in K. (xxxv. 14-15), and the first two verses in ĀpśS. xiv. 29. 3, the first in TA. (vi. 10. 1) and JB. (ii. 218), the last in RV. (x. 94. 5); they seem to be three unconnected verses. Their very obscure and questionable content is explained by the comm. as accompanying and referring to the fire that consumes a deceased teacher; the hymn is to be spoken by a pupil: this the Kāuśika prescribes (46. 14). In ĀpśS., the two verses are two out of six with which a consecrated person is to accompany six oblations offered in case he spills his seed. Parts of the hymn relate to the action of the pressing stones in crushing the stalks of the soma-plant.
