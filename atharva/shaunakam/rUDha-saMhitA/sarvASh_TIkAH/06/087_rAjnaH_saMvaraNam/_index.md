### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. ⌊This hymn and verses 1 and 2 of the next, form one continuous passage in the RV. (x. 173. 1-5): see Oldenberg, Die Hymnen des RV., i. 248-9; and cf. introduction to our iii. 12.⌋ It is further found in TB. (ii. 4. 28-9) and K. (xxxv. 7). This hymn and the one next following are used together by Kāuś.: in a kāmya rite (59. 13), by one desiring fixity (dhrāuvya or sthāirya); in a rite of expiation for earthquakes (98. 3), with xii. 1; and the comm. regards them (and not iii. 12. 1, 2) as intended by dhruvau at 136. 7 (and the same should doubtless be said of 43. 11), in the rite against the portent of broken sacred vessels; further, they appear in the indramahotsava (140.8), 87. 1 c being curiously specified in addition. In Vāit. (28. 16), this hymn alone (or vs. 1) appears in the agnicayana, at the raising of the ukhyāgni.
