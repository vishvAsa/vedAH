### Comment
All the verses found also in Pāipp., but not together; 1. occurs after the preceding hymn in xix.; 3. at a later point in xix.; 2. in x.; and there is no internal connection perceptible among them. Used by Kāuś., with the preceding and the following hymn, against birds of ill omen (46. 7); and vs. 2 is especially quoted as accompanying the leading of a cow [and] fire three times around the house. ⌊Vss. 1 and 3 occur at MGS. ii. 17. 1—see under h. 27.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Florenz, 285 or 37; Griffith, i. 260.
