### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. Translated by Ludwig (p. 431). Quite various use is made of this hymn in the sūtras. In Kāuś. it is included (9. 2) in the bṛhachānti gaṇa; it is associated (as are vi. 23, 24, 51, 57, 59, 61, 62) with i. 4-6 etc. in a rite for good fortune (41. 14); it appears in the savayajñās (66. 16), with the pavitra sava; and the comm. declares it and vi. 51, 62 to be intended by pavitrāis at 61. 5, also in the savayajña chapter. In Vāit. it accompanies a purifying rite (11. 10) in the agniṣṭoma, and (with vi. 69 etc.) the pouring out of the surā in the sāutrāmaṇī ceremony ⌊30. 13⌋; and vs. 2 in the agnyādheya (6. 11), with an offering to Agni pavamāna.
