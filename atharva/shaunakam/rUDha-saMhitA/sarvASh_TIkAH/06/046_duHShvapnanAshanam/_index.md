### Comment
The first and third verses are found also in Pāipp. xix.,* but not in connection with the hymn which here precedes. The first two "verses" are pure prose, and their description as metrical gives the Anukr. much trouble, with unsatisfactory result. The hymn is used by Kāuś. (46. 9) with the preceding: see under the latter; further, in the same ceremonies against bad dreams appears (46. 13) a pratīka which might signify either vs. 2 or xvi. 5. 1: the comm. holds that the former is intended (as including vss. 2 and 3). *⌊Roth reports xix. 57. i (= vs. 3 here) as occurring in Pāipp. ii.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 498; Florenz, 306 or 58; Griffith, i. 269; Bloomfield, 167, 485.
