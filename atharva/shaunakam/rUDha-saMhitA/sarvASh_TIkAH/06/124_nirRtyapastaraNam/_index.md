### Comment
This hymn, like the preceding, is not found in Pāipp. It is employed by Kāuś. (46. 41) in an expiatory rite for the portent of drops of rain from a clear sky. In Vāit. (12. 7) it is used in the agniṣṭoma when one has spoken in sleep; and vs. 3 separately (11. 9), in the same ceremony, when the man who is being consecrated is anointed. ⌊For the whole anuvāka, see under h. 114.⌋
