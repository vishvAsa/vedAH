### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix., and in other texts as noted under the several verses. Kāuś. uses the hymn (31. 9) in a remedial rite against boils etc.; also, in the kāmya rites (59. 28), with worship of heaven and earth, when valuables are lost; and in the savayajñas (66. 2), with v. 10, vii. 67, in a response; and, according to the comm. (the pratīka might also designate xii. i. 53), in the medhājanana ⌊10. 20⌋, with vi. 108, to accompany the partaking of some dish (milk-rice, comm.) and worshiping the sun. And vs. 2 occurs in the godāna ceremony (54. 2), with vii. 67, with wiping (the razor, comm.) thrice; and vs. 3 in the upanayana (55. 20), with vii. 97. 2, on releasing a cow. In Vāit., vs. 2 is employed in the agniṣṭoma (11. 15), near the beginning of the ceremony; and vs. 3 twice in the parvan sacrifice (4. 8, 17), once with the patnīsaṁyāja offerings, and once as the sacrificer strokes his face with his wetted hands.
