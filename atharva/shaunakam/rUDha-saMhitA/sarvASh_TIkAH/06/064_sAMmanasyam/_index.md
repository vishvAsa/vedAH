### Comment
The first two verses are found in Pāipp. xix. The whole hymn is RV. x. 191. 2, 3, 4, and is also read in TB. ii. 4. 44-5, and (with the order of the verses inverted) in MS. ii. 2. 6. In neither of these texts does the first verse of the RV. hymn (our 63. 4) stand in connection with the other verses; and as the situation of the RV. hymn is one that calls for three verses only, it is pretty evident that the first verse (which also has nothing to do with the others in point of sense) is a later addition, and has also, by an extremely curious process, not paralleled elsewhere in our text, been added at the end of our 63, in order to stand in its RV. relation to the other verses. See Oldenberg, Die Hymnen des RV., i. 244. The hymn is used by Kāuś. (12. 5) in a rite for harmony, with iii. 30, v. 1, etc.


### Translations
Translated: by the RV. translators; and, as an AV. hymn, by Ludwig, p. 372; Grill, 31, 164; Griffith, i. 280; Bloomfield, 136, 492.
