### Comment
This hymn is not found in Pāipp. Kāuś. applies it (26. 33-39), with ii. 7, 25; vi. 85, 109; viii. 7, in a healing rite against various diseases (with this hymn specially the person treated is to be smeared by means of a splinter of palāśa, ib. 34; and the head of one seized by Varuṇa is to be anointed, ib. 39); and it is reckoned (note to 26. 1) to the takmanāśana gaṇa.


### Translations
Translated: Zimmer, p. 386 (with comment on the diseases); Griffith, i. 315; Bloomfield, 40, 530.—See also Grohmann, Ind. Stud. ix. 396 ff.
