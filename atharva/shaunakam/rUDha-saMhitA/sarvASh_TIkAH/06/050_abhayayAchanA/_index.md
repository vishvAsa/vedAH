### Comment
Only the second verse is found in Pāipp., in book xix.; and no occurrence of any part of the hymn has been noted elsewhere. Its intent is obvious. In Kāuś. (51. 17) the hymn is applied in a rite for ridding the fields of danger from mice and other pests; one goes about the field scratching lead with iron (? the comm. reads ayaḥsīsaṁ gharṣan); and it is reckoned (note to 16. 8) to the abhaya gaṇa.


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 499; Florenz, 312 or 64; Griffith, i. 272; Bloomfield, 142, 485.
