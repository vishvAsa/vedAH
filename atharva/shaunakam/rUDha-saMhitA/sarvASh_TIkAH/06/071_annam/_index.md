### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. ii. (in the verse-order i, 3, 2), and vs. i a second time in xx. ⌊For Yajus versions of vss. 1 and 3, see v. Schroeder's Zwei Hss., p. 16, and Tübinger Kaṭha-hss., p. 77.⌋ Used by Kāuś. (45. 17), with iii. 29, vii. 67, etc., in a rite (following the vaśāśamana), explained as for obviating ill effects from acceptance of gifts and the like; also (57. 29), in the upanayana, accompanying an offering by the pupil from the food obtained by begging. And Vāit. (4. 16) has it in the parvan sacrifice, as the priest eats his portion.
