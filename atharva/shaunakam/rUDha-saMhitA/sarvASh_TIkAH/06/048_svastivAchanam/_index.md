### Comment
⌊Not metrical.⌋ Not found in Pāipp., but occurs in śB. (xii. 3. 43-5), TS. iii. 2, 11, PB. i. 3. 8 and 5. 12, 15, GB. (i. 5. 12-14), śśS. (vi. 8. 10-12), and KśS. (xiii. 1. 11). Used by Kāuś. (56. 4), in the upanayana ceremony, as the teacher gives and the pupil accepts a staff; and again (59. 26) in the kāmya rites, with vi. 40: see the latter; ⌊and again (59. 27), alone, with delivering a staff to one consecrated or to a Vedic student;⌋ and Keś. ⌊schol. to 16. 8⌋ regards the hymn as going with hymn 40 in the battle incantations. In Vāit. it is employed with the preceding hymn (see the latter), and also (17. 10) at an earlier part of the agniṣṭoma, with the savanas ⌊in the verse-order 1, 3, 2⌋.
