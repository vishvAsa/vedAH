### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. (in the verse-order 1, 3, 2). Used by Kāuś. (36. 12), with vi. 139 and vii. 38, in a rite relating to women, for good-fortune: one binds sāuvarcala on the head after the fashion of an herb (-amulet? Keś. and the comm. explain as the root or flower of the śan̄khapuṣpikā) and enters the village.


### Translations
Translated: Griffith, i. 317.—The association of this hymn with 139 seems to imply something more specific than "good-fortune," namely, luck in love for a man, as Keśava's yasya (not yasyās) sāubhāgyam ichati indicates.
