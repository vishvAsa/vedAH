### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. ii. (in the order 1, 2, 4, 3); and in TB. ii. 7. 71-2 (in the order 1, 4, 2, 3) and K. xxxvi. 15 (in the order 3, 2, 1, 4). This hymn and its successor are employed together by Kāuś. (13. 3-6) in a rite for glory, with the navel-hairs of sundry creatures ⌊cf. Weber, Rājasūya, p. 99, n. 3⌋, and splinters of ten kinds of trees; and they are reckoned to both varcasya gaṇas (notes to 12. 10 and 13. 1). They are further included ⌊139. 15⌋ with several others (i. 30; iv. 30, etc.) in a rite (called utsarjana, comm.) in the ceremony of entering on Vedic study.
