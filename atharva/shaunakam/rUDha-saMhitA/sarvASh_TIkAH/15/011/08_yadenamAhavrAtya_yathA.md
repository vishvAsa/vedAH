### Translation
8. In that he says to him: Vrātya, be it so as is thy will, he thereby  
gains possession of \[his\] will.

### Notes
Here again all the mss. save one (R.) omit the first four or five words,  
because they occur again in vs. 10. The majority of mss. (except  
E.D.R.s.m.K.) accent *vaśám*, though all have *váśas*. ⌊Eight or nine of  
SPP's have *vaśám*.⌋

When he says to him, Vratya, as thy will is so let it be, he secures to himself thereby the fulfilment of his will.
