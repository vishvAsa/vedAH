### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi., all but the last verse, and with 9 before 8. *⌊Verse 13 appears to be the one upon the strength of which the Anukr. declares the hymn to be trāiṣṭubham (its remaining 27 vss. being exceptions!); and even this is no real triṣṭubh. It counts indeed 44 (8 + 12: 12 + 12) and might be called purastāj jyotiṣmatī.⌋


⌊Vāit. uses only vs. 16: see under 16.—The uses by Kāuś. are many. For the uses of this hymn with h. 1, see introd. to h. 1. Further, in the name-giving ceremony, it is used (58. 14) with pouring a continuous stream of water on the youth's right hand; and this is followed (58. 15) by the binding on of an amulet of deodar (see note to vs. 28 below); and the use of vs. 16 is especially prescribed (58. 17: the text of the sītra in the comm. differs from that of Bl.) to accompany the putting a new garment upon him. Vss. 12-13 are prescribed (97. 3) in case of family quarrels (see also note to vs. 9 below); vs. 14 (comm., 14-15) is used in the tonsure ceremony (54.17); and again vs. 14 (comm., 14-15), on the child's first going out of the house (58. 18). Vs. 17 was previously prescribed for the same tonsure ceremony (53. 19: the comm. reads kṣuram abhyukṣya triḥ pramārṣṭi) on sprinkling and wiping the razor; and the same vs. is substituted for vi. 68. 3 by the Daśa Karmāṇi in the same ceremony (53. 17 note); furthermore, it is used at the beginning of the ceremony of the reception of the Vedic student (55. 3). Vs. 18 (comm., 18-19) is used on the first feeding of the child (with rice and barley: 58. 19); and vss. 20 and 22 on his "committal" (58. 20, 21) respectively "to day and night" and "to the seasons."—Bloomfield (note to 58. 17) cites a passage describing the four "committals": 1. to heaven and earth, with vss. 14-15; 2. to rice and barley, with vss. 18-19; 3. to day and night, with vs. 20; 4. to the seasons, with vs. 22.—Finally, the comm. regards vs. 15 as intended, with v. 1. 7 etc., at Kāuś. 46. 1-3, in the rite against false accusation.⌋
