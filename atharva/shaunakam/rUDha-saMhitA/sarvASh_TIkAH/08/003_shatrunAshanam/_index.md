### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. (in the verse-order 1-4, 6, 5, 7-14, 18, 15, 17, 16, 19-22, 24, 26, 25, 23). The first 23 verses are (in slightly different order*) vss. 1-23 of RV. x. 87, and most of them are found in no other text. ⌊Cf. Oldenberg, Die Hymnen des RV. i. 246.⌋ *⌊Namely, with 4 after 6, with 17 and 18 inverted, and with 12 between 21 and 22.⌋


⌊Kāuś. reckons the hymn to the cātana hymns (8. 25). The comm. says (p. 587, l. 18 ff.) that the whole anuvāka, that is hymn 4 as well as 3, is to be used in a variety of practices, which he details. In the vaśāśamana ceremony (44. 16), after the victim's "breath has been stopped" with ii. 34. 5, the performer takes his place at her right and mutters this hymn. Vs. 22 (not 21) is identical with vii. 71. 1, which was prescribed at 2. 10 for use in the parvan sacrifices, to accompany the carrying of fire thrice about the offering. Moreover, verses of this hymn are used in four expiatory rites as follows: vss. 15-18 accompany an oblation (112. 1) made when the cows give bloody milk; vs. 26 is used with vi. 63. 4 if spontaneous combustion occurs (46. 23); and the same vs. is used (130. 3) when there appears a bright glow without any fire; and yet again (131. 3), when the fire puffs (śvasati). Finally, the same vs. is used by Vāit. (6. 11) in the agnyādheya (with vi. 19. 2 etc.) with an offering to Agni śuci.⌋
