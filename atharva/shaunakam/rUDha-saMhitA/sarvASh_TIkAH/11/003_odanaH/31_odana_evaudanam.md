\*⌊The text of the Anukr. reads *enam anyābhyāṁ śrotrābhyām* (= **a** of  
33) ity āditaḥ saptadaśā ”rcyanuṣṭubhaḥ. The definition applies (perhaps  
with occasional forcing) to 14 of the 17 first *avasānas* of vss. 33-49.  
As for the other 3, the **a** of 38 and the **a** of 41 are accurately  
defined above, in the first line of the Anukr. excerpts for this  
*paryāya;* and the **a** of 37, in the definition next following the  
asterisk.⌋  
  
†⌊The definition of 33 **d**, 44 **d** (9 syllables) is omitted by the  
Anukr.⌋  
  
The second *paryāya* of this hymn is reckoned in the Anukr. as of 72  
divisions in 18 *gaṇas* or paragraphs; but the actual division in the  
mss. is into 126 such divisions (7 to each *gaṇa*), as given in both  
editions; and the metrical description of the Anukr. (as reported above)  
is also on that basis.  
  
⌊**The division of this *paryāya* into 72 avasānas.**—In his Critical  
Notice, p. 20-21, at the beginning of his first volume, SPP. treats of  
this matter; and just after the end (p. 356) of the text of his third  
volume, he prints again this *paryāya*, but divided into 72 *avasānas*  
"according to the instructions contained in the Sarvānukramaṇikā" which  
he had printed in the Critical Notice, l.c.⌋  
  
⌊The Major Anukr. calls the 18 main divisions of this *paryāya*  
(answering to the "verses" of the Berlin ed.) by the name of *daṇḍakas*.  
Since the *daṇḍakas* are all subdivided, they are also (see p. 472)  
called ganas. Each dandaka falls into 7 subdivisions or *avasānas*,  
which may be designated as **a, b, c, d, e, f, g**. Each of these 7 is  
written out and counted for the first and last *daṇḍaka* (vss. 32 and  
49, Berlin).⌋  
  
⌊Similarly, in a sequence of refrains or *anuṣan̄gas*, the refrain is  
given and counted as an *avasāna* only for its first and last occurrence  
in that sequence. The third subdivision (or **c**: beginning *taṁ vā  
aham*) of each *daṇḍaka*, being unvaried throughout the *paryāya*,  
constitutes a sequence of 18 and is given and counted independently only  
for vss. 32 and 49; while for the 16 vss., 33-48, it is given (see SPP.  
in vol. iii.) and counted as one with **b**, thus making the *avasāna*  
to consist of **b-c.**—In like manner, the sixth subdivision (or **f**:  
beginning *eṣa vā odanaḥ*) and the seventh subdivision (or **g**:  
beginning *sarvān̄ga eva*), being unvaried throughout, constitute a  
sequence of 18 and are given and counted independently only for vss. 32  
and 49; while for the other 16 vss. they are counted as one with **e**,  
thus making the *avasāna* to consist of **e-g**.⌋  
  
⌊Furthermore, and on the other hand, subdivision **e** varies as to its  
beginning between *tenāi ’nam*, *tayāi ’nam*, and *tāir enam*, and  
*tābhyām enam:* but we find no unvaried sequences of more than two  
except *tenāi ’nam* etc. in the 5 vss., 39-43, and *tābhyām* *enam*  
etc. in the 5 vss., 44-48. For vss. 40, 41, 42, accordingly, and for  
vss. 45, 46, 47, as well, not only is **f-g** reckoned to **e**, but  
also **e-f-g** is reckoned as an *anuṣan̄ga* to **d**, thus making the  
*avasāna* to consist of **d-g**.⌋  
  
⌊For these six verses, therefore, arranged and counted as 3 *avasānas*  
(**a, b-c, d-g**), we have the reckoning 6 × 3 = 18.—For verses 32 and  
49 (counted as **a, b, c, d, e, f, g**, as above noted), we have the  
reckoning 2 × 7 = 14.—And for the remaining ten verses, we have the  
arrangement and count, **a, b-c, d, e-g**, or 10 × 4 = 40. This gives us  
(18 + 14 + 40 =) 72, which is the count, not only of the Major Anukr.,  
but of the Old Anukr. or *Pañcapaṭalikā*. as well.⌋
