### Comment
Found also (except vss. 3, 20, 23) in Pāipp. xv. (in considerably altered verse-order: 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 15, 8, 9, 14, 17, 10, 11, 19, 13, 12, 18, 16, 22, 21).


⌊The hymn is included by Kāuś. 9. 2, 4 in the śānti gaṇas, major and minor; and all of the hymn except vss. 7, 9, 22, 23 (those in which the word aṅhas is missing) is reckoned to the aṅholin̄ga gaṇa (note to 32. 27). The last verse is cited separately at 58. 25 in a rite for long life. The same verse is variously cited by the subordinate works and the schol.: see note to 9. 2; 42. 13 (student's return); 53. 8 (godāna); 55. 1 (upanayana); Keś. to 44. 5 (vaśāśamana). Verse 9 is reckoned to the rāudra gaṇa, note to 50. 13.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 117, 155; Griffith, ii. 72; Bloomfield, 160, 628.
