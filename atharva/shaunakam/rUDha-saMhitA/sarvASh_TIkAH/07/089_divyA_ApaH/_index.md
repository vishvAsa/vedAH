### Comment
⌊Partly prose—"verse" 4.⌋ The first three verses are found also in Pāipp. i. Various use is made of the hymn and of its several verses in the sūtras. In Kāuś. it is addressed to the holy water (42. 13) on occasion of the Vedic student's return home, and (42. 14) vss. 1, 2, 4 accompany his laying of fuel on the fire after sunset; with vs. 3 (57. 24) his hands are washed in the upanayana ceremony, and with vs. 4 (57. 27) he partakes of hot food; two phrases occurring in the latter (edho ‘si, tejo ‘si) appear (6. 12, 13) in the parvan sacrifice, but are hardly to be regarded as quotations from it (the comm., however, considers them such); and the schol. (note to 46. 17) and comm. reckon the hymn as intended by the snānīyās, or verses to be recited at the bath taken after the death of one's teacher. In Vāit. (3. 18), vss. 1-3 accompany in the parvan sacrifice the priests' cleansing; vs. 1 (or more?) in the agniṣṭoma (24. 6) is repeated on approach to the āhavanīya fire; with vs. 3, the sacrificer's wife is decked in the cāturmāsya sacrifice (8. 20); with vs. 4, fuel is laid on the fire in the parvan sacrifice (4. 1).
