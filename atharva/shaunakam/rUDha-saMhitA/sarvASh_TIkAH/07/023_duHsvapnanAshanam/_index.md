### Comment
The hymn is merely a repetition of iv. 17. 5 above, and is not found in Pāipp. otherwise than as part of the latter hymn. It is used neither by Kāuś. nor by Vāit. ⌊As to its insertion in the second anuvāka, see p. 389, near top.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Henry, 9, 62; Griffith, i. 338.
