### Comment
Wanting in Pāipp., but perhaps by reason of the lacuna noted under the preceding verse. Employed by Kāuś. (79. 7) in the same ceremony as the preceding hymn, with the direction ity abhichādayati, which may well enough mean, as plainly required by the sense of the verse, 'she envelops him,' but is explained by the schol. as 'one envelops the two spouses.'


### Translations
Translated: Weber, Ind. Stud. v. 248; Grill, 55, 179; Henry, 14, 67; Griffith, i. 343; Bloomfield, 96, 546.
