Book VII.

⌊The seventh book is made up mostly of hymns of one verse or of two
verses. No other one of the books i.-xviii. contains such hymns. Book
vii. is thus distinguished from all the others of the three grand
divisions (to wit, books i.-vii., books viii.-xii., and books
xiii.-xviii.) of the Atharvan collection, and constitutes the close of
the first of those divisions. If we consider the facts set forth in the
paragraphs introductory to the foregoing books (see pages 1, 37, 84,
142, 220, 281, and especially 142), it appears that this division is
made up of those seven books in which the number—normal or prevalent—of
verses to a hymn runs from one to eight. Or, in tabular form, division
one consists of

|             |        |      |     |      |       |      |     |              |
|-------------|--------|------|-----|------|-------|------|-----|--------------|
| Books       | vii\.  | vi\. | i\. | ii\. | iii\. | iv\. | v., | having for   |
| Verse-norm: | 1 or 2 | 3    | 4   | 5    | 6     | 7    | 8   | respectively |

In the Berlin edition, the book contains one hundred and eighteen hymns:
of these, fifty-six are of 1 verse each, and twenty-six are of 2 verses
each; while of the remaining thirty-six

|                         |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |         |
|-------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| There are in this book  | 10  | 11  | 3   | 4   |     | 3   | 1   | 1   | hymns,  |
| Containing respectively | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 11  | verses. |

The 11-versed hymn is 73; the 9-versed is 50; the 8-versed are 26, 56,
97; the 7-versed are 53, 60, 109; the 6-versed are 20, 76, 81, 82. The
whole book has been translated by Victor Henry, *Le livre VII de
l'Atharva-Véda traduit et commenté*, Paris, 1892.⌋

⌊As the Major Anukramaṇī speak.s of book vi. as the *tṛca-sūkta-kāṇḍa,
tṛca-prakṛti*, so it speaks of book vii. as the *eka-rca-sūkta-kāṇḍa*.
Presumably, therefore, we are to regard the 1-versed hymn as the "norm"
of the book, although the 2-versed hymn is undeniably "prevalent."⌋

⌊See p. cxlix.⌋

⌊The book is divided into ten *anuvāka*-groups. These, with the number
of hymns in each group and the number of verses in each group, are here
given:

|          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Anuvāka: | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| Hymns:   | 13  | 9   | 16  | 13  | 8   | 14  | 8   | 9   | 12  | 16  |
| Verses:  | 28  | 22  | 31  | 30  | 25  | 42  | 31  | 24  | 21  | 32  |

The Old Anukramaṇī seems to take 20 verses as the norm of the *anuvāka*.
The Paris codex, P., in this book numbers the verses through each
*anuvāka* without separating the hymns. The commentator divides the
*anuvākas* into hymns (from two to four in each *anuvāka*), which
"hymns," however, are nothing more than mechanical decads of verses with
an overplus or shortage in the last "decad" when the total is not a
multiple of ten: thus, *anuvāka* 1 has three hymns, of 10 + 10 + 8 = 28
verses; 2 has two hymns, of 10 + 13 = 23 verses; 3 has three hymns, of 9
+ 10 + 11 = 30 verses; 4 has three hymns, of 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 verses;
and so on. His *anuvāka* endings coincide throughout with those of the
Berlin edition, save that vii. 23 is reckoned by him (and P.) to
*anuvāka* 2 instead of 3, thus making for 2 and 3 his verse-totals 23
and 30 instead of 22 and 31 (as the Old Anukramaṇī gives them) and
spoiling the count of his first "decad" in 3. (Note that vii. 23 is a
*galita*-verse.) His "decad"-divisions cut in two our hymns 26, 45, 54,
68, 72, 76, 79, 97, and 109.⌋ ⌊It should here be mentioned that the
Bombay edition, following the Major Anukramaṇī, counts hymns 6, 45, 68,
72, and 76 each as two hymns. From vii. 6. 3 to the end of the book,
accordingly, Whitney gives a double numeration of the hymns: first the
numeration of the Berlin edition, and then, in parenthesis, the
numeration of the Bombay edition. As against the former, the latter
involves a plus of one from vii. 6. 3 to vii. 45. i; a plus of two from
vii. 45. 2 to vii. 68. 2; a plus of three from vii. 68. 3 to vii. 72. 2;
a plus of four from vii. 72. 3 to vii. 76. 4; and a plus of five from
vii. 76. 5 to the end. Finally it may be noted that vii. 54. 2 is
reckoned (forwards) to vii. 55, but that this does not affect the
hymn-numbers save for the verse concerned.⌋ ⌊Respecting book vii. in
