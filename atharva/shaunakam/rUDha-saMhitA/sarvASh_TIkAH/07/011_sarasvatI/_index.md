### Comment
Like the preceding hymn, not found in Pāipp.; also not in any other known text. Kāuś. uses it (38. 8), with i. 13, in a ceremony against the effect of lightning; and also (139. 8), with the same and other hymns, in the rites of entrance upon Vedic study
(upākarman, comm.). And the comm. quotes it as applied in śānti-Kalpa 15 with observances to ketu.
