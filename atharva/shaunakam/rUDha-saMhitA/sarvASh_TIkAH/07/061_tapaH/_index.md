### Comment
In Pāipp. (xx.) is found only the second half* of vs. 1. The hymn is, according to Kāuś. (10. 22), to be pronounced at āgrahāyaṇa full-moon, in a medhājanana rite (for acquisition of sacred knowledge); also (57. 23), in the ceremony of reception of a Vedic student, in the ⌊agnikārya⌋, next after hymn 33 (both verses are quoted, each by its pratīka); and the schol. (note to 53. 4) introduce both verses in the godāna ceremony. *⌊But R's notes give a variant for 1 b, as below!⌋
