### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. Found in Kāuś. (59. 29) in a rite for welfare, with worship of the Rudras; and reckoned (note to 50. 13) to the rāudra gaṇa. Used repeatedly by Vāit.: in the parvan sacrifice (4. 10), when the cleansing tuft is thrown in the fire, and again, in the cāturmāsya sacrifice (9. 18), with a cake to Tryambaka; also (24. 17) at the end of the agniṣṭoma, when the priests quit the place of sacrifice.
