### Comment
This hymn and the one following are not found in Pāipp. There is apparently no real connection between the three parts of the hymn. Used by Kāuś. (32. 8: according to Keś. and the comm., vss. 1 and 2, which alone are applicable) in a healing ceremony, with the aid of various appliances, "used as directed in the text." It is added: "with the fourth verse one puts down upon and pierces [them]" (32. 9), but the fourth verse of this hymn suggests no such use, and Keś. declares 76. 2 to be intended.* Verse 3 appears (36. 25), with hymn 45 etc., in a rite against jealousy; and vs. 4 is made (1. 34) an alternate to v. 3 when entering on a vow; in Vāit. (1. 13) it follows v. 3 in a like use. The comm. here ⌊p. 4571⌋ quotes apacitām ⌊vii. 74⌋ as read at Kāuś. 31. 16, and understands this hymn instead of vi. 83 ⌊apacitas⌋ to be there meant; but under vi. 83 he quotes apacitas, and understands accordingly!
