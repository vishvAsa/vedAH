### Comment
The first two verses of this hymn are found in Pāipp. xx., but in a fragmentary and corrupt condition; the remaining three, in iii. Used, according to Kāuś. (36. 12), with vi. 129, 139, in a rite concerning women; the plant is fastened to the head (of the woman ⌊so the comm.⌋), and she enters the village. (Keśava explains differently.) ⌊He regards a man as object of the rite (tasya śirasi baddhvā), as indeed the text of vs. 2 d requires.⌋
