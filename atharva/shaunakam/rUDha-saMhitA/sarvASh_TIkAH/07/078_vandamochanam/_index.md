### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. Used in Kāuś. (32. 3) with 29 and other hymns of this book, in a remedial rite: see under 29. Also vs. 2 by itself (2. 41), with x. 6. 35, as substitute for xii. 1. 19-21, with laying on of fuel, in the parvan sacrifices; and in the ājyatantra (137. 30), with other verses, with strewing (of barhis); its second pāda is further found as first part of a verse given in full in 3. 1. In Vāit. (4. 11) it accompanies, with other verses, the untying of the sacrificer's wife in the parvan sacrifice.
