### Comment
Found also, except vss. 7-9, in Pāipp. xx. (the first six verses in the order 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3); the first six verses, further, in AśS. iv. 7 and śśS. v. 10 (in both, in the order 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 3); the last five are RV. verses etc.; see under the several verses. The hymn in general does not appear in Kāuś. (the sacrifice which it accompanies not falling within its sphere); but the last verse (so the comm.; it might be ix. 10. 20) is applied (24. 17) in settling the kine in their pasture by one who is going away from home; and again (92. 15), in the madhuparka ceremony, when the presented cow is released instead of being sacrificed. Vāit. uses several of the verses, all in the agnisṣṭoma ceremony: vss. 3 and 4 (14. 5) with the offering of the gharma; vs. 7 (14. 4) in summoning the gharma cow; vs. 11 (14. 9) before the concluding homa.


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 429 (vss. 1-6); Henry, 28, 93; Griffith, i. 361.
