### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. (but only the first half-verse). Used by Kāuś. (36. 33), in a rite concerning women, to prevent generation of a male child; also (48. 37), with hymn 31 etc., against enemies: see under 31. Vāit. (29. 6) applies the verse, with the next, 35. 1, in the agnicayana, while the bricks called asapatna are laid on the fifth course of the fire-altar.
