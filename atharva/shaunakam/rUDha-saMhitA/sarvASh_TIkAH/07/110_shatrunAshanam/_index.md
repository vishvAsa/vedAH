### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx., vs. 3 not with vss. 1, 2. Kāug. (15. 11) employs the hymn (the comm. says, vss. 1 and 2), with vii. 3 etc., in battle incantations: see under 3;  further (59. 20), for the satisfaction of various desires, with worship of the deities mentioned in the verses. Vāit. (8. 6) has it (vss. 1, 2?) with an oblation to Indra and Agni, in the āgrayana iṣṭi; and vs. 3 (3. 17), in the parvan sacrifice, as the priests receive and partake of their iḍā-portion.
