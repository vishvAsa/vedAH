### Comment
Like the preceding hymn, not found in Pāipp. Not used in Kāuś. (if iv. 21. 7 is intended in 19. 14). But the comm. says here that the ritual application in the rite for prosperity of kine has already been stated, referring, probably, to his exposition under iv. 21. 7, where he spoke of two verses, although the hymn had none after 7; possibly the two verses of this hymn are what he had in mind.


### Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 469; Henry, 30, 96; Griffith, i. 364.
