### Comment
Only vss. 1-3, and those not complete, are found in Ppp. (xx.). Most of the material of the hymn is found in RV. ⌊i. 154 and 22⌋ and elsewhere: see under the different verses. The hymn is found in Kāuś. (59. 19) only in connection with hymn 17 etc. (see 17). But in Vāit. the different verses appear many times. Verse 1 is used (13. 14) in the entertainment of Vishṇu, in the agniṣṭoma (next after hymn 5, above), and later in the same ceremony (15. 12), with setting up the support of the havirdhānas. Verse 3, in parvan ceremonies, accompanies (4. 20) the sacrificer's approach to the āhavanīya fire; and again, in the agniṣṭoma (13. 5), his exit from the sacrificial hut; while its second part (c-f) goes with the offering of an oblation to Vishṇu at the beginning of the paśubandha (10. 1). Verses 4 and 5 accompany (15. 10) offerings to the two wheel-tracks of the havirdhāna-carts in the agniṣṭoma. With verse 6, in the agnicayana (29. 2), mortar and pestle are set down; and with 6 and 7, in the paśubandha (10. 10), the sacrificial post is set upright; and the comm. regards vs. 4 as intended by the "verse to Vishṇu" in 2. 3 and 23. 14. The comm., moreover, quotes the hymn as used by the Nakṣatra Kalpa (18) in a mahāśānti ceremony named vāiṣṇavī; and vs. 3 c-f by the same (14) with an offering to Vishṇu in the adbhutaśānti; and vs. 4 by the same (19), in the rite called tvāṣṭrī, with tying on of a triple amulet.
