### Comment
This and the two following hymns are wanting in Pāipp. This one (the comm. says, with 92 and 93 also) is used by Kāuś. (59. 7), with vi. 5 and 6, by one desiring a village; also (140. 6), with v. 3. 11 and vii. 86, to accompany an offering of butter in the indramahotsava; and it is reckoned to the abhaya gaṇa (note to 16. 8), and to the svastyayana gaṇa (note to 25. 36).
