### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx., and in a whole series of other texts: TS. (i. 7. 122), MS. (i. 10. 3), ACS. (ii. 19. 32), KśS. (xxv. 6. 10), śśS. (iii. 17. 1). Kāuś. (15. 11) prescribes the use, with vi. 125 and vii. 110 and a couple of single verses from elsewhere (the comm. includes also vii. 4), in the battle incantations, while the king and his charioteer mount a new chariot; as to its medical employment with vii. 2, see under the latter. Vāit. (9. 15) uses the verse in the 'sākamedha ceremony, on leaving the sacrificial hut.
