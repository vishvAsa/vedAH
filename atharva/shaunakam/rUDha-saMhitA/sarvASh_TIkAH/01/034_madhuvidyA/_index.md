### Comment
Verses 1, 2, 5 are found in Pāipp. ii., vs. 3 in vi., and vs. 4 in part in viii. It is used by Kāuś. in a ceremony for superiority in disputation (38. 17): the ambitious disputant is to come into the assembly from the north-east, chewing the sweet plant; again, twice in the nuptial ceremonies, once with tying a madugha amulet on the finger (76. 8), and once (79. 10) on crushing the amulet at the consummation of the marriage. The comm. further declares it used at the disputation in the aśvamedha sacrifice; but he quotes no authority for it. All these applications are evidently imposed upon the hymn, not contained in it.
