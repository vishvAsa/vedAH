Found in Pāipp. i., and also in TS. (v. 6. 1), MS. (ii. 13. 1), and the Mantrapāṭha ⌊i. 2. 2-5⌋ (Winternitz in Denksch. d. Wiener Akad. xl. 44). ⌊See also MGS. i. 2. 11 and p. 158.⌋ Reckoned by Kāuś. to the apāṁ sūktāni 'hymns of the waters' (121. 1, and 7. 14, note), also to both the śānti gaņas (9. 1, 4); appears further, with several other hymns, in a rite for good-fortune (41. 14); and in the godāna ceremony to accompany bathing after the shaving (54. 5), also in the feet-washing of a guest (90. 9), against the portent of the appearance of water in a waterless place (121. 1), and against that of the causeless breaking of water-jars etc. (136. 8).
