### Comment
The hymn is not found in Pāipp. It and the two that next follow are reckoned by Kāuś. (9. 1, 4) to both śānti gaņas, major (bṛhat) and minor (laghu); also (7. 14) to the apāṁ sūktāni or water-hymns, applied in various ceremonies; and by some (18. 25, note) to the salila gaņa, which Kāuś. begins with hymns 5 and 6. The same three are joined with others (19. 1) in a healing rite for sick kine, and (41. 14) in a ceremony for good fortune. Again (25. 20), this hymn is used (with vi. 51) in a remedial rite, and (37. 1) in the interpretation of signs. Hymns 4-6 further appear in Vāit. (16. 10) as used in the aponaptrīya rite of the agniṣṭoma sacrifice, and 4. 2 alone with the setting down of the vasatīvarī water in the same sacrifice. The four verses are RV. i. 23. 16-19; for other correspondences, see under the verses.
