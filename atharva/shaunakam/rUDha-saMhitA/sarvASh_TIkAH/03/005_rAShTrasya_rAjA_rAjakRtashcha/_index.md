### Comment
Found (except vs. 8) in Pāipp. iii. Used by Kāuś. (19. 22), with viii. 5 and x. 3, 6, to accompany the binding on of an amulet for general prosperity (tejobalāyurdhanādipuṣṭaye, comm.). And the comm. quotes it from Nakṣ. K. ⌊comm. should say śānti K.—Bloomfield⌋ as employed in a mahāśānti named ān̄girasī. ⌊In the prior draft, W. writes "For success of a king: with" etc. as title of this hymn. Its place in the collection, next after iii. 3 and 4, and its second vs., seem to justify that title.⌋
