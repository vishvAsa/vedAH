### Comment
Verses 1-4 found in Pāipp. i., but defaced. The hymn is used by Kāuś. (55. 17-18; also 55. 1, note), with i. 9, 30, etc., in the ceremony of reception of a Vedic student, and, according to the schol. (10. 19, note), in that for the generation of wisdom (the comm. says, as belonging to the āyuṣya gaṇa). Verses 5 and 6 are the same with vi. 94. 1, 2, and it is vi. 94, rather than these verses here, that is used in Kāuś. 12. 5 (the comm. blunderingly prescribes the use under both passages). Verse 4 has the same pratīka as xiv. 1. 32 and one or the other of the two verses is taught in Vāit. (22. 1) as used "by Kāuśika" in the agniṣṭoma; but our Kāuś. has no such use, and it is doubtless xiv. 1. 32, 33 that he prescribes (79. 17 ff.) in the nuptial ceremonies; but the comm. reports the use here, as if it referred to vss. 4 and 5. The comm. further regards the hymn as employed by the Nakṣ. K. (18), in the āirāvatī rite, and by Pariśiṣṭa 5. 3; in both cases as an āyuṣya hymn.
