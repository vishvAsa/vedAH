### Comment
The verse seems to imply a hidden comparison of the poet's work with the plowman's. The other texts (RV. x. 101. 4; VS. xii. 67; TS. iv. 2. 55; MS. ii. 7. 12; K. xvi. 11; Kap. xxv. 3) read sumnayā́ (but K. has -yuḥ: Kap. not noted), which the translation adopts, -yāú seeming an unintelligent corruption of it; but the comm. gives a double explanation of -yāu, one as "desiring a happy-making sacrifice" and qualifying yajamāne understood, the other as from sumna-ya (-ya for root yā) and qualifying balīvardāu understood! He makes sīra equivalent with lān̄gala, and takes vi tanvate as = "put on the oxen's shoulders"; vi-tan as here applied seems imitated from its use of stringing a bow; in TB. ii. 5. 812 we have even ví tanoti sī́ram.
