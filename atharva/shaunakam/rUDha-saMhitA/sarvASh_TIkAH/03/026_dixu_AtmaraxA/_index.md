### Comment
The corresponding utterance in TS. reads: "missiles by name are ye; your houses there are in front (in the east); fire is your arrows, ocean (salilá)"—and similarly in what follows. Ppp. prefixes rakṣa (once rakṣaḥ) at the beginning of each verse. The comm. appears to take devā́s throughout as a vocative (he devāḥ); he defines it as meaning "Gandharvas"; the arrows are either fire or else Agni. The Anukr. apparently restores yé asyā́ṁ, and also makes the refrain to be of 11 + 10 = 21 syllables; then the initial "pādas" of 1, of 3 and 4, of 5, of 2, and of 6 count respectively as 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27 syllables, and the complete numbers vary from 44 to 48 syllables. ⌊The Anukr. ought to call vs. 2 nicṛt and vs. 5 virāj.—For "gods" as an address to the serpents, cf. vi. 56. 1, where they are called "god-people."⌋
