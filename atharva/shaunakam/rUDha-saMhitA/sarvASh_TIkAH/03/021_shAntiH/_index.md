### Comment
The whole of the hymn is found in Pāipp., vss. 1-9 in iii., vs. 10 in vii. The material is used by Kāuś. in a number of rites: it is reckoned (9. 1; the comm. says, only vss. 1-7) to the bṛhachānti gaṇa; it appears in the charm against the evil influence of the flesh-eating fire (43. 16-21; according to the comm., vss. 1-7 are quoted in 16, and the whole hymn in 20); again, in the establishment of the house-fire (72. 13; vss. 1-7, comm.); again, in the funeral rites (82. 25), on the third day after cremation, with oblation to the relics; once more, in the expiatory ceremony (123. 1), when birds or other creatures have meddled with sacrificial objects. Moreover, vs. 8 (the comm. says, vss. 8-10), with other passages from xii. 2, in a rite of appeasement in the house-fire ceremony (71. 8). In Vāit., vss. 1-7 are used in the agniṣṭoma (16. 16) on occasion of the soma becoming spilt; and vs. 7 in the sākamedha part of the cāturmāsya sacrifice ⌊9. 17⌋.
