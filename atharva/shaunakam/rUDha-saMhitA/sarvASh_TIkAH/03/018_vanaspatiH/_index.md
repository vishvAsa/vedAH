### Comment
This peculiarly Atharvan hymn has found its way also into the tenth book of the Rig-Veda (as x. 145, with exchange of place between vss. 3 and 4; it is repeated in RV. order at MP. i. 15. 1-6). Only three verses (our 4, 2, 1, in this order) are found in Pāipp. (vii.). Kāuś. uses it, among the women's rites, in a charm (36. 19-21) for getting the better of a rival; vs. 6 a and b accompany the putting of leaves under and upon the (rival's) bed. And the comm. (doubtless wrongly) regards vss. 5 and 6 to be intended by the pratīka quoted in 38. 30, instead of xii. 1.54, which has the same beginning.
