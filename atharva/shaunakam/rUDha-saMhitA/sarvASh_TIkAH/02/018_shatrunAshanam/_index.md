### Comment
⌊Not metrical.⌋ Ppp. has some similar phrases in ii. The hymn belongs to the cātanāni (Kāuś. 8. 25: the comm. regards only the last three verses as cātana, because vs. 3 is the one whose pratīka is cited in the Kāuś. text; but it is perhaps more likely that arāyakṣayaṇam is an oversight for bhrātṛvyakṣ-); it is used by itself also in one of the witchcraft rites (ābhicārikāṇi), while adding fuel of reeds to the fire (48. 1).


### Translations
Translated: Weber, xiii. 180; Griffith, i. 61.
