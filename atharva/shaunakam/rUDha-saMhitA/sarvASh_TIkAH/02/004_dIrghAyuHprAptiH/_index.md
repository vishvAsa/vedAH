### Comment
Found also (except vs. 6 and parts of 1 and 2) in Pāipp. ii. Accompanies in Kāug. (42. 23) the binding on of an amulet "as described in the text" (iti mantroktam), against various evils (the comm. says, "for thwarting witchcraft, for protecting one's self, for putting down hindrances").
