### Comment
Found in Pāipp. ii. Kāuś. uses the hymn in the rite or charm for overcoming an adversary in public dispute: one is to come to the assembly from the north-eastern direction (because of its name aparājita 'unconquered'), chewing the root of the plant, and to have it in his mouth while speaking; also to bind on an amulet of it, and to wear a wreath of seven of its leaves (38. 18-21). Verse 6, again, is reckoned (50. 13, note) to the rāudra gaṇa. The comm. further quotes from the Nakṣ. ⌊error for śānti⌋ K. (17, 19) a prescription of the use of the hymn in a mahāśānti called aparājitā.
