### Comment
Found in Pāipp. iv. Both Weber and Grill regard the hymn as directed against abortion; but no sufficient indications of such value are found in its language, though some of the native authorities intimate their discovery of such. Kāuś. (8. 25) reckons it to the cātana hymns; and it is employed, with ii. 7 and other hymns, in a remedial ceremony (26. 33-36) against various evils, specially accompanying the smearing of the designated plant with sacrificial dregs (sampāta) upon the patient.


### Translations
Translated: Weber, xiii. 187; Grill, 20, 92; Griffith, i. 64; Bloomfield, 36, 302.
