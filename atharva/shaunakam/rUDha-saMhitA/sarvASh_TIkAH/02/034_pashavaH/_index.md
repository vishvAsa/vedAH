### Comment
Found in Pāipp. iii.; and also in the Black-Yajus texts, TS. (iii. 1. 41-3), and K. (xxx. 8, in part). Used by Kāuś. (44. 7) in the vaśāśamana ceremony, accompanying the anointing of the vaśā; in the same, vs. 5 accompanies (44. 15) the stoppage of the victim's breath; and the same verse appears in the funeral rites (81. 33), with verses from xviii. 2 and 3, in connection with the lighting of the pile. This hymn and the one next following are further employed among the kāmyāni, with invocation of Indra and Agni, by one who "desires the world" (59. 21: "desires over-lordship of all the world," comm.). In Vāit. (10. 16), the hymn (so the comm.) is said on the release of the victim from the sacrificial post in the paśubandha.
