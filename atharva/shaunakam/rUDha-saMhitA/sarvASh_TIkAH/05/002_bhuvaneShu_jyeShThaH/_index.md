### Comment
Found also in Pāipp. v. It is a RV. hymn (x. 120); and the first three verses occur in other texts. For the use of the hymn with its predecessor in Kāuś. 15. 1 and 22. 1 and 19. 1, note, see above, under h. 1; it is further applied, with vii. 1, in a kāmya rite (59. 17), with worship of Indra and Agni. The various verses appear also as follows: vs. 3, in a rite for prosperity (21. 21); vs. 4, with vi. 13 in a battle-rite (15. 6); vs. 5 in a similar rite (15. 8); vs. 6, in another (15. 9), and yet again, with vi. 125, and vii. 3 etc., as the king and his charioteer mount a new chariot (15. 11); vs. 7, next after vs. 3 (21. 23), with the holding of a light on the summit of an ant-hill; and vs. 8 in a women's rite ⌊34. 21⌋, next after v. 1. 4—all artificial uses, having no relation to the texts quoted in them.
