### Translation
87. They who are here, O Fathers—alive here are we—\[be\] they after  
us; may we be the best of them.

### Notes
The translation here implies certain emendations of the text: *pitaras*  
⌊accentless⌋ in 87 and the first time in 86, and the omission of *yé*  
after the second *pitáras* in 86: the latter is made also in our text,  
while SPP. reads, with the mss., *yé ‘tra pitáraḥ pitáro yé ‘tra yūyáṁ  
sthá*. As to the accent of the *pitaraḥ pitaro* in 86, the mss. are  
wildly discordant, presenting every possible variation, and, considering  
the many accentual blunders which they commit in this part of the text,  
the details are not worth reporting, nor need we feel any hesitation in  
amending to what seems to make the best sense. The omission of *yé* is  
much more serious, but seems demanded by the sense, and by the analogy  
of 87. Similar passages are found in ⌊TS. iii. 2. 5⁶,⌋ TB. i. 3. 10⁸⁻⁹  
⌊like TS.⌋, and śśS. iv. 5. 1 (the latter nearest like our text: *ye  
‘tra pitaraḥ pitaraḥ stha yūyaṁ teṣāṁ śreṣṭhā bhūyāstha: ya iha pitaro  
manuṣyā vayaṁ teṣāṁ śreṣṭhā bhūyāsma*); compare also MS. i. 10. 3 and  
AśS. ii. 7. 7.\* All our mss. save one (Op.), and most of SPP's, leave  
*stha* in 86 unaccented; this non-accentuation, so far as it goes,  
favors the omission of *yé*. *Bhūyāstha* is a grammatically impossible  
form, and should be emended to *-sta*, which is read by ⌊TS. and⌋ TB. in  
the corresponding passage; śśS., as has been seen, gives *-stha*. One of  
SPP's mss. has *bhūyāsta*. In 87, most of the mss. insert an *avasāna*  
after *smaḥ*, and SPP. follows them; it is of course senseless, unless  
we use one also after *stha* in 86†; nor does the Anukr. appear to  
acknowledge it, since it notes no difference of division as between the  
two verses; but our ⌊printed⌋ text at any rate blunders in not reading  
either *smo asmā́n* or *smo ‘smā́n* since it has omitted the  
*avasāna*-mark. The metrical definitions of the Anukr. are worthless, as  
there is no trace of meter in the two passages; they can by violence be  
read into the number of syllables called for.  
  
\*⌊In the second and third paragraphs below are given these passages  
from TB., MS., and AśS. The TS. passage agrees with the TB. passage,  
save that TS. has *yè ‘smíṅ loké* for the very bad *yè ‘smiṅ loké* of  
TB.⌋  
  
†⌊We ought, I think, in fact to read with SPP. an *avasāna*-mark after  
*smaḥ* in vs. 87, not only as being abundantly supported by the mss. of  
both editions, but also as called for by the sense and the general  
(quadripartite) structure of the verse. And the same applies to the  
reading of an *avasāna*-mark after *stha* in vs. 86; it is printed in  
neither edition, but appears to be well warranted by the authorities of  
both.⌋  
  
⌊The TB. passage, at i. 3. 10⁸⁻⁹, with the *avasānas* as printed in the  
Poona ed., is: *yá etásmiṅ loké sthá* (8) *yuṣmā́ṅs té ‘nu* । *yè ‘smiṅ  
loké* । *mā́ṁ té ‘nu* । *yá etásmiṅ loké sthá* । *yūyáṁ téṣāṁ vásiṣṭhā  
bhūyāsta* । *yè ‘smiṅ loké* । *aháṁ téṣāṁ vásiṣṭho bhūyāsam*.—This  
passage and its analogues have been discussed in two papers by  
Böhtlingk, *Berichte der sächsischen Gesell.*, sessions of July 8, 1893,  
and May 2, 1896. In the first, having the TB. passage before him, he  
proposed to read, in place of the first *sthá*, the word *syús*, and to  
begin the first apodosis with it, and to delete the second *sthá*. In  
the second, having our AV. verses before him, he ascribes the false  
ending of *bhūyāstha* of 86 to the correct preceding *stha;* and, on the  
other hand, the false *sma* of 87 to the correct ending of *bhūyāsma*.  
The false *sma*, however, is—as we have seen—to be printed *smo* or  
*smaḥ* (cf. *Index*, p. 41 b). Moreover, he suspects that the second  
*pitaras* of 86 may be a corruption of *páretās* ('mortui istic vos  
estis'): this would be an easy corruption in *nāgarī*, but I do not feel  
that *páretās* offers a better antithesis to the *jīvā́s* of 87 (śśS.  
*manuṣyās*) than does the word *pitaras* itself; and the latter are  
distinctly enough other-world beings: cf. 2. 48 (but also 49), and 1.  
50, 54 above, also x. 6. 32.—Apropos of the blunder *bhūyāstha:* reading  
Dīgha Nikāya on the day of writing the above note, I observed at ix. 7,  
line 5, the phrase *saññā uppajjanti* etc., 'ideas arise,' and then in  
the very next sentence, *ekā saññā uppajjanti*, 'a single idea arise,'  
with plural verb-ending, albeit the *ekā* makes the breach of common  
concord most manifest and some mss. indeed read *uppajjati*. For the  
like error, see xv. 7. 3: cf. also notes xiv. 2. 59; xviii. 3. 47.⌋  
  
⌊The MS. passage, p. 143⁶, is: *eṣā́ yuṣmā́kam pitaraḥ: imā́ asmā́kam: jīvā́  
vo jī́vanta\[ḥ\] ihá sántaḥ syāma*.—The AśS., p. 125 end, reads: *etā  
yuṣmākam pitaraḥ: imā asmākam: jīvā vo jīvanta iha santaḥ syāma*. To  
this, Gārgya, in his *vṛtti*, adds: *itikārādhyāhāreṇa sūtracchedaḥ:  
santaḥ syāmeti mantraḥ paṭhitavyo vaḥkāraṁ varjayitvā*.—The *etās* and  
*imās* seem to refer to *svadhā́s* (cf. śśS. as above: *yā atra pitarḥh  
svadhā, yuṣmākaṁ sā: ya iha pitara edhatur, asmākaṁ saḥ*); and the *eṣā́*  
of MS. appears to require correction to *etā́* p. *etā́ḥ*.⌋
