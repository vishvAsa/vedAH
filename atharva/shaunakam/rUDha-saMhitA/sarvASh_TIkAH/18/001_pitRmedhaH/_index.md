### Comment
⌊Only one verse (46) is found in Pāipp., and that in book ii. Only four sūtras of the Vāit. cite verses from this hymn, and those verses are 44-46, 51, and 55. In the Kāuś., as already noted by Whitney, p. 814, nearly all the verses from 1. 40 to the end of the book have their uses in the ritual. That Parts I. and II. and III. of the hymn as divided below are utterly impertinent to the proper subject of the book and therefore without ritual application, is a fact on which Weber, Sb. 1895, p. 819, has already animadverted.⌋


⌊A clear synoptic statement of the provenience of the different groups of verses, or of the single verses, that enter into the composition of this hymn appears so desirable for the critical study thereof, that I subjoin the following:


⌊It thus appears that every verse of our hymn has its correspondent in the RV. save four (or five, if one wishes to count vs. 57): to wit, vs. 17, which is not found to my knowledge in any other text; vss. 27, 28, repeated from AV. vii. (see above); and vs. 61, found in SV.⌋
