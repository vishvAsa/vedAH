### Translation
2. The profound one hath surmounted all things; the most mighty one hath  
ascended to the loftiest sky; the eager night spreads toward me like a  
friend with excellent *svadhā́s*.

### Notes
The translation follows our text of the verse, which, however, is full  
of emendations, and by no means satisfactory. Nearly every ms. reads at  
the beginning *ávi* (one *áviṁ*, and one authority ⌊SPP's reciter V.,  
with impossible accent⌋ *ábhi*), while Ppp. has *abhi*, which is also,  
except for the accent, an easier emendation for *ávi*. The comm. has  
*ati*. Nearly all authorities, again, have for verb in **a** *áruhat*  
(the accent is perfectly defensible as an antithetical one, and might  
well have been left in our text); but the reciter V. gives (*ábhi*)  
*árhat*, thus agreeing in part with the (*ati*) *arhat* of the text of  
the comm.; ⌊and one of W's mss. has *ásahat*⌋. The explanation of the  
comm. reads *atyarhati*, which he glosses by *atikramya vyāpya vartate*,  
which is wholly without authority, since even the Dhātūpaṭha gives only  
*pūjāyām* as the sense of *arh*. Ppp. has *aruhat*. SPP. goes half way  
with the comm., adopting *áti...aruhat* (unnecessarily abandoning the  
"ancient accent" of the verb). All authorities have *víśvāni* (but Ppp.  
only *viśvā ar-*); and all ⌊save Ppp. again⌋ have *gambhīró*, p. *-ráḥ*,  
⌊but one of W's pada-mss. gives *-rā*, p.m.⌋, although the comm.,  
again.st his own text (according to SPP.), explains *gambhīrā*. Here  
perhaps Ppp. brings help, reading *gabhīro ’d varṣ-;* this is better  
than our *-rā́ = rā́: ā́*. ⌊The *gabhīrā́* of the Berlin ed. seems to be a  
misprint for *gambhīrā́*, if we judge by the Collation Book and the Index  
Verborum: but it may be intended as an emendation, as it certainly is a  
metrical improvement.⌋ SPP. reads *gambhīró vá-*, although *gambhīrás*  
is simply unusable, and the change to *-rā́* as easy as possible. Nearly  
all, including Ppp., read *várṣiṣṭham*, ⌊save three of SPP's authorities  
and one of W's, which have *-ṣiṣṭam*⌋. Then follows in nearly all  
*aruhántas*, p. *aruhántaḥ;* but *-háta* is found in one, *-hánta* in  
two, and *arháti* is given by a reciter, with the comm.; the comm. has  
*arhati*, and explains it precisely as he did his *ati...arhati* above;  
SPP. emends to *aruhanta;* our ⌊ā́...⌋ *dyā́m aruhat* is very bold, but  
the case was a desperate one. Ppp. reads *aruhad aśraviṣṭhā*, and this,  
with emendation to *áśramiṣṭhā* (cf. RV. iv. 4. 12), makes acceptable  
sense. One of SPP's mss. has *śramiṣṭhā́*, but doubtless only by  
accident; all the other authorities, including the comm., have ⌊apart  
from some unimportant details⌋ *śraviṣṭhā́*, which SPP. emends to  
*śráviṣṭhāḥ*. There was probably no sufficient reason for our changing  
*śrav-* to *śav-* in our text. The fairly acceptable and least altered  
version of the line would be this: *abhí víśvāny áruhad gambhīró ’d  
várṣiṣṭham aruhad áśramiṣṭhā*. The third pāda is in equally bad  
condition. All the authorities ⌊with unimportant variants⌋, including  
Ppp., have at the beginning *uśatī́ rā́try* (*a-*), but the *pada*-mss.  
give *rā́tri* instead of *rā́trī*, as they should give, and as SPP's  
*pada*-text reads by emendation. What follows it the *pada*-mss. offer  
as *ánu॰sāma: drā́him* (or *drāhím*); in the *saṁhitā*-mss. the first  
word appears as *ánusāma* (once *ánusama*) or (accentless, and so making  
one word with *-drā́him* or *-drā́hi*) *anusāma-* or *aṁnusāma-*; and the  
second appears as *-drā́him*, *-drā́hi*, *drā́him*, *drā́hím*, *drāhí*,  
*drā́vi*, *prā́him*. The rest of the half-verse, *tiṣṭhate mitrá iva  
svadhā́bhiḥ*, is the same in all, including the comm. and Ppp. SPP.  
emends to *ánu sā́ bhadrā́ ’bhí ti-*, which appears to be modeled on our  
*ánu mā bhadrā́bhir ví ti-*, but is defective both in sense and in meter.  
The comm. gives *anukṣaṇaṁ vi ti-*, cutting loose entirely from the  
ms.-reading; his own text, according to SPP., has *anusāmadrā vi ti-*.  
Ppp., finally, has *avasāna bhadrād vi ti-*, which suggests the  
emendation *uśatī́ rā́try ávasā no bhadrā́ ví tiṣṭhate* etc. Our *ví  
tiṣṭhate*, at any rate, is by the support of Ppp. and the comm. put  
nearly beyond question. ⌊I have made some modifications in the above  
paragraph which I could not well indicate by the ell-brackets.—For those  
who do not have the Bombay ed., it may be well to give SPP's  
reconstructions of the verse: first, the text of the comm.: *ati viśvāny  
arhad gambhīro varṣiṣṭham arhati śraviṣṭhā: uśatī rātry anusāmadrā vi  
tiṣṭhate mitra iva svadhābhih;* second, the text which the comm.  
actually explains: *ati viśvāny arhati gambhīrā varṣiṣṭham arhati  
śraviṣṭhā: uśatī rātry anukṣaṇaṁ vi tiṣṭhate mitra iva svadhābhiḥ;*  
third, SPP's reading: *áti viśvāny aruhad gambhīró várṣiṣṭham aruhanta  
śráviṣṭhāḥ: uśatī́ rā́try* (p. *rā́trī*) *ánu sā́ bhadrā́ ’bhi tiṣṭhate mitrá  
iva svadhā́bhiḥ*.⌋

Over all depths hath she gone up, and mounted, most mighty One, the sky's exalted summit. Over me now the loving Night is spreading with her auspicious. Godlike ways like Mitra.
