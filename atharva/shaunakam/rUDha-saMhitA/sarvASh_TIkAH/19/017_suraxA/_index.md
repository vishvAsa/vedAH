### Comment
⌊Prose.⌋ ⌊Not found in Pāipp.⌋ This hymn and the next are used, the comm. points out, in the same ceremony as 16, with other hymns, as detailed in Pariśiṣṭa 4. 4; both are also prescribed in Par. 19. 1 (see note to Kāuś. 140. 9), in a ceremony against danger from the various quarters. ⌊See introd. to next hymn.⌋ ⌊Note that the vss. of this hymn group themselves in 5 dyads (comm., paryāya-dvayas), one for each cardinal point and a fifth for the 'fixed and upward points'; and that those of h. 18 do likewise and are so grouped by the comm. also.⌋
