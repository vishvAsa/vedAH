### Comment
The hymn is made up of the remaining verses of RV. vii. 35, ⌊vss. 11-15,⌋ with another RV. verse (v. 47. 7) added. Among the former the differences of order and reading are very slight. ⌊The hymn is found, as noted under hymn 10, in Pāipp. xiii.⌋


### Translations
Translated: Griffith, ii. 272; and also, of course, by the RV. translators.
