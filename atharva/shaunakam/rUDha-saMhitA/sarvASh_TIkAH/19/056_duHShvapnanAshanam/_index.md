### Comment
If prámadā (p. prá॰madā) is to be rendered as above, it must have its accent changed to pramádā; the comm., against the pada-text, understands it as pramadās = striyas, joint object with mártyān of prá yunakṣi. One or two mss. read mártān in b. The comm. renders dhīras by dhṛṣṭas. ⌊Apart from Ws P.M.W., which have svā́pnam,⌋ all the mss., the comm., and SPP., read svápnam in d, and the translation follows this rather than our svápna, willing, in so obscure a matter, to stick as closely to the authorities as possible. Ppp., to be sure, gives svapna mi-, but this counts for very little. The comm. understands the verse to be addressed to the demon of ill-dreaming (he duḥsvapnābhimānin krūra piśāca); but his explanations through the whole hymn are worthless, being only the etymologizing guesses of one to whom the real sense is precisely as obscure as it is to us: asura is prāṇavant ātman; the 'lonely one' is the man who is dying of the effect of evil-dreaming, having abandoned son, wife, relatives, etc.; yāsi means yantalokam prāpayasi; and so on, and so on. ⌊Griffith cites "Death and his brother Sleep" of Shelley's Queen Mab (it is found also at Iliad xiv. 231) and "the twins, Sleep and Death," II. xvi. 682.⌋
