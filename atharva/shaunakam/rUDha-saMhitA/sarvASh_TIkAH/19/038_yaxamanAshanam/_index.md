### Comment
All the mss., and SPP., read in a árundhate, which our text emends to ar-; but the form is obviously false; ā́ rundhate would be the simplest and easiest change. Ppp. has yakṣmā ru- ⌊i.e. yakṣmāru-: which may of course mean yakṣmās ā ru- as well⌋; and, at end of b, -tho ‘śnute. As everywhere, the mss. vary between gugg- and gulg- in c; SPP. adopts the latter; the comm. agrees with our text in giving the former; Ppp. has always gulg-. At the end of d, all the mss. have aśnute, but this time SPP. follows us in making the necessary emendation to aśnuté. ⌊Again, as often (cf. note to xviii. 3. 47), the accent-blunder is due to a faulty assimilation,—in this case, with the accent of of aśnute at the end of the preceding half-verse.⌋
