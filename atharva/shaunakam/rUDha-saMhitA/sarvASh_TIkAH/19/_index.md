Book XIX.

⌊**Supplementary hymns.**⌋

⌊This nineteenth book forms a supplement to the three grand divisions of
the Atharvan collection, and is shown to be a later addition by a
considerable variety of cumulative evidence. The evidence concerns in
part the contents of the book; in part, the character of its tradition
as respects both text and division and extent; and in part, the relation
of its text to the ancillary Vedic treatises, the Pada-pāṭha and the
Pañcapaṭalikā and the Prātiśākhya, and to the Kāuśika and Vāitāna
sūtras.⌋

⌊**The contents** of book xix. resemble in large measure those of the
earlier books, and wear (as W. says: see the General Introduction) the
aspect of after-gleanings: of hymn 1 with i. 15; h. 18 with iv. 40; h.
34 with ii. 4, and especially 34. 4 with ii. 4. 6; h. 39 with v. 4; h.
44 with iv. 9; h. 57 with vi. 46. Had these hymns of book xix. been
parts of the original collection, we should have expected (as W.
intimates) to find them in their respective places with those of the
earlier books. But more conclusive evidence could hardly be wished than
is offered by hymn 23 of book xix., which hymn, under the form of
"Homage to parts of the AV.," is incidentally also in some sort a table
of contents to the preceding eighteen books, and presupposes their
existence as a collection, and in an arrangement substantially accordant
with that which they show in our text: cf. the introduction to h. 23.⌋

⌊**The general character of the tradition** in this book is strikingly
inferior to that of the preceding eighteen. Such a statement can be duly
verified only by a detailed study of the verses of the book, with
reference to their intelligibility as they stand, and to the
multiplicity or wildness of the variants presented; but a casual glance
at the footnotes on pages 478, 484-5, and 539 of the Bombay edition will
give some idea of their multiplicity. Many of them (like *trī́n nā́kaṅs*
at 27. 4: see W's note) "are of the superficial variety of discordant
readings which swarm in this book and have no real importance." Others
are blunders of the grossest sort, as to which there is substantial
agreement among the authorities or even complete harmony: such for
example is the impossible *yásmāi...yacchati* at 32. 2, where not a
single one has the absolutely necessary *yácchati:* cf. W's note to 45.
5. Especially noteworthy is vs. 4 of h. 40 as illustrating "what this
nineteenth book can do in the way of corruption even of a text that is
intelligibly handed down elsewhere" (so Whitney: the AV. version is so
utterly corrupt that he is forced to translate from the RV. version, RV.
i. 46. 6). If degrees of corruption and badness are to be distinguished,
perhaps we may set down 49. 2 as the worst in book xix., or possibly in
books i.-xix.; in the latter case, vi. 22. 3 is surely a close second.
The uncertainties of the tradition of this book as to the precise amount
of material to be included in it, and as to its division and the
numeration of the parts, are rehearsed in the sequel: cf. the references
at p. 898, end of ¶2.⌋

⌊**Relation of the text of book xix. to the ancillary Vedic
treatises.**—First, the Pada-paṭha appears to be very modern, as it is
certainly very blundering and untrustworthy: see SPP's notes on pages
410 and 460 and especially 543, and W's note on hymn 68, and observe,
for example, the wild resolution of *vármā sīvyadhvám* as *várma: asi:
vi॰adhvám* at 58. 4. The corruptness of the text made Whitney doubt (in
1862: see his Prāt., p. 581) the existence of a
*pada-pāṭha*.—**Second**, book xix. is entirely ignored by the
Pañcapaṭalikā or Old Anukr., as is stated also by SPP. in his Critical
Notice, vol. i., p. 24.—**Third**, "to the apprehension of the
Prātiśākhya the Atharva-Veda comprehended only the first eighteen books
of the present collection": so Whitney, Prāt., p. 581; cf. his Index of
passages referred to by the AV. Prāt., p. 600 c, and especially his
notes to Prāt. ii. 67 c and ii. 22.⌋

⌊**Relation of book xix. to Kāuśika.**—The sūtra-citations do not imply
recognition of the text of book xix. as an integral part of the
*saṁhitā*.—Bloomfield has made a critical separation of the more
original *vidhāna*-matter from the *gṛhya*-matter in the text of
Kāuśika, and styles the former "Atharva-sūtra" or "Vidhāna-sūtra": see
his Introd. to Kāuś., p. xxviii., and his essay in *Göttingische
gelehrte Anzeigen*, 1902, p. 489. His Vidhāna-sūtra comprehends the text
of Kāuś. from the beginning of kaṇḍikā 7 to the end of kaṇḍikā 52,
excepting perhaps most of the matter (42. 19 to 43. 20) just preceding
the *vaśāśamana*, and excepting the *vaśāśamana* itself (43. 21 to 45.
19): that is, his Vidhāna-sūtra runs from 7. 1 to 42. 18 and from 46. 1
to 52. 21.\*—Now it is in the first place to be noted that no verse
whatever is cited in the text of the "Vidhāna-sūtra" (whether by
*pratīka* or by technical designation or in *sakalapāṭha*) which is also
to be found in book xix., with the single exception of *prā́ṇa prāṇám*.†
In the second place, disregarding the verses cited by technical
designation (the "*jivās*-verses": see below) and those which are cited
in full and by *pratīka* besides (33. 3; 52. 5; 72. 1: see below), it
appears that there are in the entire text of Kāuśika only six *pratīkas*
which might seem at first blush to imply the recognition of book xix. as
part of the Atharvan text by Kāuśika. The six *pratīkas* cover some
eleven verses. Including with them a seventh *pratīka*, *devásya tvā*, I
give them in tabular form:

The place of citation in Kāuśika is given at the left; the place of
occurrence in AV. is given in parentheses; and the texts, other than
AV., in which the mantras occur, are noted at the right in square
brackets.⌋ \*⌊This delimitation of the Vidhāna-sūtra differs slightly
from Bloomfield's as given in the places just cited: it has been revised
with the help of a friendly note from him.⌋ †⌊The verse *prā́ṇa prāṇám*
(xix. 44. 4) is cited at 47. 16, which is a part of Bloomfield's
"Vidhāna-sūtra," and seems to have been overlooked by him at p. xxxi.⌋
‡⌊Keśava (on 6. 37) and Darila (on 45. 17) understand the whole AV. hymn
of five verses as intended by *kā́mas tád*.⌋

⌊**Citations by pratīka**.—The three phrases, (1) *devásya tvā savitúḥ
prasavé* and (2) *aśvínor bāhúbhyām* and (3) *pūṣṇó hástābhyām*, are
unvaried as between the AV. text and the citations by Kāuś. (in full at
2. 1 and 2. 21 and 137. 18: the citation at 91. 3 is by *pratīka* with
*áyuto ‘hám*) and by Vāit. (in full at 3. 9): what follows *hástābhyām*
is, at Kāuś. 2. 1, *agnáye júṣṭaṁ nír vapāmi* (as at TS. i. 1. 4²); at
2. 21 and in Vāit., it is *prasūtaḥ praśiṣā paristṛṇāmi* (Vāit.
*pratigṛhnāmi*); and at 137. 18 it is *ā́ dade* (as at TS. i. 3. 1¹ and
very often); while AV. xix. differs from all these in adding *prásūta ā́
rabhe*. The phrases are of such extremely frequent occurrence (see
introd. to h. 51) that they may be called a commonplace of the
*sūtra*-literature; and, as W. intimates, the *pratīka*-citation by
Kāuś. is not to be regarded as having any special reference to our book
xix.,—much less the citations in full by Kāuś. and Vāit. The case is a
typical and striking one. Of the same type are the hymns *tvám agne
vratapā́ asi* and *ágne samídham ā́hārṣam*, both of which, besides, are
given by the scholia in *sakalapāṭha*. For the rest, so far as any
necessary connection with book xix. is concerned, *vā́n̄ ma āsán* and
*kā́mas tád* and *ávyacasaś ca* may fairly be regarded as *kalpajā
mantrās*. Only for *áyuto ‘hám* am I unable to point out occurrences
elsewhere than in book xix.; but it may be noted that the comm., at p.
499⁴, takes *áyuto ‘hám* and the immediately following *devásya tvā* as
one *sūkta* of sacrificial formulas, *yajurmantrātmakaṁ sūktam*.⌋

⌊**Citations by technical designation.**—Thrice in the text of Kāuś. (at
3. 4; 58. 7; 90. 22), as also once in Vāit. (at 1. 19), we meet the
prescription *jīvābhir ācamya*. The "*jīvā́s*-verses," says Dārila (on 3.
4), mean "four verses beginning with *jīvā́ stha*." They are associated,
both at Kāuś. 3. 4 and at Vāit. 1. 18, 19 as well, with other
*sūtra*-material, and in particular also with the five *prapads* (which
are called in Vāit. *prapadanas* and which Dārila characterizes as
*kalpaja*): considering this fact, the citation may well be viewed as
containing no distinct reference to our book xix., albeit indeed the
verses are found there as 69. 1-4; and the entire absence of
*sakalapāṭha* both in text and in scholia, if taken in connection with
the mode of citation (by a technical name and so without *iti*), does
not appear to be inconsistent with this view.⌋

⌊**Citations in sakalapāṭha.**—The most conclusive evidence to show that
book xix. was not recognized by Kāuś. is afforded by the five verses
which, although occurring in our xix., are yet cited by Kāuś. in full
(*sakalapāṭha*): these are 59. 3; 33. 3 and 44. 4; and 52. 5 and 72. 1.
As to the first of the five, *ā́ devā́nām ápi pánthām aganma*, cited at 5.
12, Bloomfield has already remarked in his note that the *sakalapāṭha*
shows that it is regarded as coming from some other source than our book
xix., and it is in fact not infrequent elsewhere (RV.MS.TS.śB.);
moreover, it is a part of the same group as *tvám agne vratapā́ asi*, of
which group, as already noted, Dārila (on 6. 37) gives the
*sakalapāṭha*. The verses *tvám bhū́mim* (cited in full at 2. 1: a later
citation, at 137. 32, is naturally by *pratīka*) and *prā́ṇa prāṇám*
(cited in full at 47. 16) have not been found, so far as I know, except
at xix. 33. 3 and 44. 4; but of the former Dārila expressly says that it
is *kalpaja*. Finally, there remain the cases of *yát kāma* and *yásmāt
kóśāt*. These are peculiar in that they are cited at 92. 30 and 139. 25
by *pratīka*, and immediately thereafter (at 92. 31 and 139. 26) in
*sakalapāṭha:* cf. Bloomfield's Introduction, p. xxix. The verse *yát
kāma* is found at xix. 52. 5, and *yásmāt kóśāt* at the end of the book,
and neither elsewhere.⌋

⌊**Relation of book xix. to Vāitāna.**—Still less than Kāuśika, does
Vāitāna imply by its citations a recognition of the text of book xix. as
an integral part of the *saṁhitā*.—In all Vāitāna there are only seven
sūtras (Garbe gives five) that cite passages occurring in book xix.:
they are Vāit. 1. 18 and 19, citing the *apratiratha* hymn and the
"*jivā́s*-verses"; 3. 5 and 19. 12, citing *ā́ devā́nam;* 3. 9, citing
*devásya tvā;* 28. 14, citing *yád agne yā́ni kā́ni cit;* and 37. 19,
citing *sahásrabāhus*. Of these, the *devásya tvā*, the
"*jīvā́s*-verses," and the *ā́ devā́nām* are cited also by Kāuś. and have
already been sufficiently discussed. Of the remaining three: the
*puruṣa* hymn (*sahásrabāhus:* xix. 6) appears also in RV.VS.TA.SV.;
and the verse *yád agne yā́ni kā́ni cit* (xix. 64. 3) is common to RV.,
and to the Yajus texts, MS.K.Kap.TS.VS.; while the *apratiratka* hymn
(*āśúḥ śíśānaḥ:* xix. 13. 2 ff.) is found in RV. and the Yajus texts
just named and in SV. also.⌋

⌊**Divisions of the book.**—The *prapāṭhaka*-division is not found in
this book, having ended with book xviii.; nor does any decad-division
appear. The following statements refer to the hymns as printed, divided,
and numbered in the Berlin edition. The book numbers 72 hymns, with 456
verses, and is divided into seven *anuvākas*. If the verses numbered
455, a precisely even division would give 65 to each *anuvāka*, and it
appears that the division aims in general to make each *anuvāka* as
nearly of that length as may be without breaking hymns: but hymn 20 is
put into *anuvāka* 2 rather than 3, because it forms a subject-group
with hymns 17-19; for a like reason the limit of *anuvāka* 4 is set
after hymn 33 and not before it; and that of *anuvāka* 5, after hymn 45
and not before it. A tabular conspectus follows:

|          |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
