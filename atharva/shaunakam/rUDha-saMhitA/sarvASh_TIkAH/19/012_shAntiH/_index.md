### Comment
The hymn, or verse, is wanting in Pāipp. Its first half is identical with RV. x. 172. 4; its second half, with RV. vi. 17. 15 (also SV. i. 454). It is reckoned as a śanti-hymn, and used as such in company with the hymns that precede it ⌊see note to Kāuś. 9. 7⌋.


### Translations
Translated: Griffith, ii. 273; and by the RV. translators.
