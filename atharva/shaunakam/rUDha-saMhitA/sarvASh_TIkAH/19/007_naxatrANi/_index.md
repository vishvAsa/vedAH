### Comment
The translation implies our conjectural emendation of turmíśam ⌊two of W's mss., -mich-⌋ in c to aṣṭāviṅśám (or -śā́). ⌊This is supported by the textually unimpeachable aṣṭaviṅśā́ni of 8. 2 a, and the fact that the series in this hymn is actually of 28 members, as noted in the introduction.⌋ The comm. has turmiśām, and gives for it a double etymology and explanation: either it is turmi + śā, or it is tur + miśā; in the former case, turmi is from root turv, and means "injuring" (hiṅsaka), and śā is the root śā 'sharpen,' hence "make thin"; in the latter case, tur is ⌊a root-stem from⌋ root turv, and miśā is by Vedic license for miṣā, from root miṣ "contend" (spardhāyām); in either case, the compound means "putting down oppressors," and is adjective qualifying sumatim! All the mss. accent saparyā́mi, and SPP. admits it in his text; the accent is defensible, and would be required by Brāhmaṇa usage. Our emendation in c helps the meter as well as the sense; but no stress can be laid upon the circumstance that the Anukr. appears to regard the verse as a full triṣṭubh.
